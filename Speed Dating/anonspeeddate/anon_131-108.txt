0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  male108?  
0:06 0:06 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:07 0:09 MALE:  Hi.  So, which school are you from?  
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  I'm from the law school.  
0:11 0:11 MALE:  Oh, you're from the law school?  
0:09 0:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, I was actually doing the [unintelligible] JD/MBA program.  
0:16 0:17 MALE:  Oh, okay, yeah I've heard of it.  
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, so I'll get the Business Master's.  
0:20 0:25 MALE:  Oh, okay, so that's two-year program, one year in the law school and one year in the business school or something?
0:23 0:24 FEMALE: Uh, it's actually four years in total.  
0:27 0:29 MALE:  Oh, okay.  That's a long time.  
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, I wish it was two years.  
0:30 0:30 MALE:  Oh. 
0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  It would make my life a lot easier.  
0:32 0:32 MALE:  Okay.  
0:30 0:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm doing my first year here at the law school. Next year I'll be at the B school, and my last year will be at the--
0:40 0:42 MALE:  [interposing]  Okay, that's a complicated step right there.  
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, and where are you from?  
0:46 0:48 MALE:  I'm from India.  
0:43 0:45 FEMALE:  Oh, but which department are you from?  
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Double "E", electrical engineering.  
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:50 0:52 MALE:  Yeah, most of the engineering is from--
0:50 0:54 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, MBA, electrical engineering.  The same as Chinese people too.  
0:57 0:59 MALE:  Yeah, there are lots of people, yeah.  
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:00 1:04 MALE:  So, you all ready to do your undergrad?  I did my undergrads in India.  
1:02 1:04 FEMALE:  Oh, did you go to IAT?  
1:07 1:07 MALE:  Exactly.   
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
1:09 1:11 MALE:  You know that.  
1:08 1:11 FEMALE:  All the usual suspects, right?  [laughter]  I did my undergrad at Harvard.  
1:15 1:19 MALE:  Okay, that should--okay, that should [unintelligible], and what was your--
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  [interposing]  That's the IAT of the United States.  
1:20 1:27 MALE:  Okay.  Okay, so you had your [unintelligible] 16-minute program or something where this comparison was made?  
1:24 1:25 FEMALE:  No, no I just--
1:28 1:34 MALE:  There is a program in which somebody said like combine all the Harvard MIT and this and then you'll get the IETers.  
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  That's hilarious.  
1:36 1:38 MALE:  Yeah, that was too funny actually.  
1:35 1:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, no--I mean actually I know a lot of people who have gone there.  But I guess it's the natural peer school is for the graduates to [unintelligible].  
1:47 1:47 MALE:  Right.  
1:45 1:50 FEMALE:  Isn't going to school in India a lot different than being in graduate school here?  
1:53 1:54 MALE:  Oh, definitely.  
1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  What's the university system like there?  
1:56 2:09 MALE:  The university system is not much like--it's not so professionalized as you have the United--the schools in the United States.  So, what we feel is like, okay, in terms of [unintelligible] like Stanford is one of the best.  And they are the best people.  
2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
2:11 2:23 MALE:  So--well, yeah, all of the smart people actually come up here, and so they don't have that good people for their graduates.  Like the graduate schools are--the quality of the graduate schools are not as comparable to the undergraduate schools.  
2:21 2:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:25 2:25 MALE:  That's a problem.  
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, how big is IET?  
2:27 2:32 MALE:  Oh, the number of students we have is like 3,000 or something including the graduates and undergraduates.  
2:29 2:29 FEMALE:  So, that's actually quite small.  
2:33 2:34 MALE:  Oh, that is very small.  
2:31 2:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, and especially compared to how big India is.  
2:37 2:42 MALE:  Yeah, but that's one IET.  So, if you combine--there are six IETs.  
2:40 2:41 FEMALE: Okay, I didn't realize there were many campuses.  
2:45 2:50 MALE:  so there are six different locations all of our IETs, but are named according to the places.  
2:47 2:50 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  So, did you go to the one in--what city were you in?  
2:53 2:58 MALE:  I was in the East one--the East India.  It's called [unintelligible].  It's near Calcutta.  
2:54 2:55 FEMALE:  Calcutta?  
2:59 3:00 MALE:  Yeah, it's near Calcutta.  
2:59 3:05 FEMALE:  Interesting.  I mean like do they have different reputations, or?  
3:05 3:12 MALE:  No, no, no--yeah, there is always comparison between them about the ranking and all that, but pretty much all of them are really good and--
3:09 3:12 FEMALE: [interposing]  Yeah, was yours the best?  
3:16 3:18 MALE:  I won't say that, but in some respects.  
3:15 3:17 FEMALE:  You can tell me.  It's only be recorded here.  
3:21 3:49 MALE:  Yeah, mine is the oldest.  It's about the first one.  So, it's pretty strong in academics, and it's not that much.  Actually, it doesn't have so much industry-related [unintelligible].  But otherwise it's really good.  Yeah, and so--yeah, so how do you enjoy the law school?  And I always hear that there are some engineering students who go around and go to the personal--what's it called?  IT law.  
3:47 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, actually, there will be more classes that involve both law school and engineering programs because there are a lot of people at the law school who are really interested in like [unintelligible].  And they don't know anything about technology at all.  
4:01 4:02 MALE: Right.  
3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  But it's actually a really fun place. 
4:04 4:04 MALE:  Okay.  
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  I really enjoy it there.  
4:05 4:06 MALE:  Okay.  
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  Are you [unintelligible] shoes?  
4:08 4:12 MALE:  Yeah, I had a few questions to talk to you, but that's okay.  Yeah.  
4:12 4:12 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you.  
4:16 4:16 MALE: It was nice to meet you.
