0:00 0:04 FEMALE:  I thought I was getting faster at these.  I really did.
0:06 0:11 MALE:  I know.  I'm slowing down.  I feel like now I'm putting more thought into them or something.  I don't know.  [laughter] Or maybe I'm just getting into the whole thing.
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  female328.
0:12 0:12 MALE:  I'm male301.
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male301.
0:14 0:14 MALE:  Good to meet you.
0:14 0:16 FEMALE:  Uh so what are you up to at Stanford?
0:17 0:18 MALE:  I'm in the teacher education program--
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Oh really?  
0:19 0:19 MALE:  --so.
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  So this is familiar to you?
0:20 0:23 MALE:  This is my spot.  Yeah, exactly.  It's kind of funny to be in here in a kind of a different context--
0:22 0:22 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:23 0:26 MALE:  --and not have to be working, but what can I--sorry.
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Cool.  How do you like it?
0:28 0:29 MALE:  I really like it actually.
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:29 0:29 MALE:  I was really glad I came.  I um I feel like I've learned a lot.
0:31 0:31 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:32 0:37 MALE:  And uh--and I could so much more like I'm in um training to be a high school math teacher, right.
0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  Oh, I see.
0:38 0:44 MALE:  But uh--and everyone at some level think that they can do that.  Like 'cause everyone's had teachers.  They feel like oh, you know, that's something I could do.  
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:44 0:47 MALE:  But really, like now that I've had this like whole year of training--
0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:47 0:50 MALE:  --like I realized how much I didn't know, you know, and how much there really is to think about.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE:  Have you taught before?
0:52 0:53 MALE:  I've done like environmental education.
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:54 0:58 MALE:  And I've done like um--and I worked for a wilderness therapy program for like kids that have drug and alcohol addiction and stuff.
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Oh wow.
0:59 1:03 MALE:  So I've done like--I've worked with kids a lot, but I haven't never taught in a classroom.
1:02 1:05 FEMALE:  So what inspired you to be a high school math teacher?
1:06 1:11 MALE:  [laughter] Um it's like a job interview.  Is it?  [laughter]
1:10 1:12 FEMALE:  Oh no.  No, I'm just curious.
1:13 1:13 MALE:  No.
1:12 1:17 FEMALE:  Because, I mean, I loved my high school math teachers, and I'm just curious of what makes a high school math teacher tick.
1:18 1:20 MALE:  That's great that you love your high school math teachers.
1:19 1:20 FEMALE:  They were good to me.
1:21 1:26 MALE:  [laughter] Um there's a few things.  One, math is like something I've always kind of--like I could always do and--
1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:26 1:27 MALE:  --I felt like it's something I should--
1:26 1:26 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:28 1:29 MALE:  --be able to share and explain to other people. 
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:30 1:32 MALE:  So like even in high school, you know, like I tell my friends about it.
1:31 1:31 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:33 1:46 MALE:  So it's kind of always something I kind of knew I could do.  Um and then in terms of being a teacher, like, I just always felt like I want to do something where I could feel like, you know, feel like you're making a difference and feel like um you're having an impact on people in some way.
1:45 1:45 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:47 1:54 MALE:  And with kids, you can definitely see that right.  And I--and I worked for a while--like I didn't--I resisted being a classroom teacher.  Like after I graduated from college, I spent a couple years doing different things like--
1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:54 2:00 MALE:  --teaching Environmental Ed and stuff, but the kids come out and they're like--you know, like you only get them for like a week or you get them for a couple days at a time--
1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:01 2:03 MALE:  --and really uh you don't really get to see any influence on them right? 
2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:04 2:08 MALE:  But if you get--I saw that if you get--if you have kids for a year, you might be able to have some kind of influence over them, so.
2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  I think that's awesome.
2:09 2:12 MALE:  That's kind of letting me decide for sure what I want to do.
2:12 2:15 FEMALE:  Well, and has this encouraged you or discouraged you or--
2:17 2:21 MALE:  I think it's back and forth.  Like it's really--teaching is definitely one of the hardest things I've ever done, so.
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:22 2:27 MALE:  And every day, there's some of--the answer is kind of a--it's a profession of contradictions--
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:27 2:30 MALE:  --'cause you have to be like really into every student and like really want to learn from--
2:30 2:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:31 2:32 MALE:  --like really know your students.
2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:33 2:40 MALE:  But you have to be--you can't take things personal [unintelligible] right.  And you have to be--you have to really like strive for success on all levels, right, but you have to be comfortable with families--
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  Right.
2:41 2:42 MALE:  --'cause every day there'd be something that goes wrong, like one thing--
2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  Right.
2:43 2:46 MALE:  --nothing--you're never going to have a perfect day, right.  Every kid is learning every day--
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:46 2:48 MALE:  --like improving, right.  Like you always have something that [unintelligible].
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Have you had Elliott Eisner?
2:52 2:52 MALE:  I haven't, no.
2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  Have you--have you read his stuff?
2:53 2:53 MALE:  I have.
2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  What do you think?
2:55 2:55 MALE:  I like--I--
2:55 2:59 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  This is turning into a [laughter]--like a job interview.  I'm so really curious.  Do you mind?
3:01 3:02 MALE:  No, that's fine.  Are you doing education, too?  Yeah, a little--
3:01 3:05 FEMALE:  Um I took a class with Elliott, and then I've--I've taken a couple classes over here.
3:07 3:19 MALE:  I haven't read too much of him, but from what I've read and what I've heard, I really--I like all his ideas about um teaching and relating to students, I guess.  I mean, I'm probably not the best person to ask me that.
3:19 3:22 FEMALE:  Okay.  [laughter]  No, no, no.  No, I'm more curious about what you personally think.
3:23 3:30 MALE:  I mean, like, I'm a big fan of like--like nontraditional systems and like working with--I'm a big fan of like talking about status in classes--
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:30 3:33 MALE:  --and like dreading kids--every kid to feel like they know what they're doing--
3:32 3:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
3:33 3:36 MALE:  --and feel like they can make improvement, feel like they could have a stake in the matter--
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:37 3:38 MALE:  --in [unintelligible], so.
3:37 3:40 FEMALE:  No, that's cool.  That's great.  I feel like I've been quizzing you.
3:41 3:41 MALE:  No, that's okay.
3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  Is there something I can tell you?
3:42 3:45 MALE:  Tell me a little bit about yourself.  Okay, where--what uh--what's your deal?
3:44 3:51 FEMALE:  Well, so I'm getting my MBA at the business school.  I'm currently working on a robotics startup.
3:52 3:53 MALE:  Oh.
3:52 3:54 FEMALE:  Um we're going to do consumer robotics.  It's--
3:56 3:57 MALE:  Consumer robotics?
3:56 4:02 FEMALE:  Yes, robots for the home.  Have you ever seen the rumba?  It's a robotic vacuum cleaner.
4:03 4:04 MALE:  Yes.  I see.  Oh that's [unintelligible].
4:03 4:06 FEMALE:  [laughter]  Well, very nice to meet you.
4:07 4:07 MALE:  Good to meet you.
4:08 4:09 FEMALE:  Date C.
4:10 4:10 MALE:  Date C, yeah.
4:10 4:10 FEMALE:  Couple Daves .
4:12 4:15 MALE:  I think there is too many Daves.  There's a good Dr. Seuss poem about that if I remember right.
4:15 4:15 FEMALE:  [laughter]
