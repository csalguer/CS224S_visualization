00:48  00:49	MALE:  I guess you have a roommate that's a big studier and you're a partier or you're a studier and your roommates a big partier or something like that?
00:50  00:54	FEMALE:  I don't think there's that -- it's actually, she's Mormon.  The roommate we didn't know is Mormon, so it was a little bit of an interesting --
00:55  00:56	MALE:  So she's like a huge partier.
00:56  00:57	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
00:57  00:58	MALE:  All she ever does is get hammered all the time.
00:58  01:09	FEMALE:  So, luckily -- I mean like, she's live very nice and tolerant.  I think she's just kind of amused by us.  And -- and -- and she doesn't like complain [laughter].  You know, she doesn't say, like, no alcohol in the house or anything like that.  So you know.  
01:10  01:11	MALE:  Huh.
01:12  01:13	FEMALE:  Always have a designated driver.
01:14  01:14	MALE:  That's fair, that's what she said?

01:19  01:21	MALE:   Oh, good.  Feel like you have to justify yourself to your roommate.  I'm sorry, god.
01:22  01:34	FEMALE:  [laughter] no, no, she did -- I did try and tell her, you know, during the raining season, I lived in Portland for a couple of years and the people who lived in Portland it was our big thing, like, have some whisky every night.  It keeps you -- I keeps you well.  You know.
01:35  01:35	MALE:  Yeah.
01:36  01:37	FEMALE:  It kills all the germs.
01:37  01:38	MALE:  Whisky helps keep the doctor away.
01:38  01:48	FEMALE:  Exactly.  And ah, Sarah, the Mormon roommate was like, it's not that kind of alcohol.  I was like you don't understand.  She's like whatever [laughter].
01:49  01:52	MALE:  Huh?  It's like I wonder if they -- I mean does she ever seem like she regrets that she has to be that way, or does she --
01:53  01:53	FEMALE:  She loves it.  
01:53  01:54	MALE:  Really?
01:54  02:07	FEMALE:  No, for her -- I feel like I've met some of her friends who are maybe sort of like teeter on the edge a little more.  But she is like totally, gung ho, it's her thing, like loves it, loves all of it.
02:08  02:09	MALE:  I couldn't do that.
02:09  02:12	FEMALE:  So, you know, it works for her.
02:13  02:13	MALE:  To each his and her own, I suppose.
02:14  02:16	FEMALE:  Exactly, you know [laughter] different people have their thing.
02:17  02:18	MALE:  Different strokes for different folks, is that what they say?
02:19  02:21	FEMALE:  That's what they say [laughter].
02:22  02:23	MALE:  So what do you do for fun?
02:24  02:24	FEMALE:  Oh you mean when I'm not --
02:25  02:27	MALE:  That just seems like such a lame question.  Sorry, that's the first time I've --
02:28  02:29	FEMALE:  Just rephrase it like when your not sitting in front of me or --
02:30  02:33	MALE:  Okay.  Oh when you're partying [unintelligible].
02:34  02:40	FEMALE:  [laughter], when your not sitting in front of me or a computer or really in books, so what do you do.
02:41  02:42	MALE:  Okay, pretend I said that.
02:42  02:52	FEMALE:  Well [laughter], ah, hanging out with friends, doing stuff outside, maybe going to the pool and diving [unintelligible].
02:53  02:53	MALE:  Like high dive? 
02:54  02:54	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:55  02:56	MALE:  Really?
02:56  02:57	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I was a diver in college, so.
02:58  02:58	MALE:  That's sounds scary.  Where did you go to college?
02:59  02:59	FEMALE:  William's College.
03:00  03:00	MALE:  Okay, good.
03:01  03:06	FEMALE:  So yeah.  Ah, is it scary well, 10 meters is scary, but I don't really dive 10 meters.  
03:07  03:08	MALE:  So ten meters like --
03:09  03:09	FEMALE:  Thirty-three feet.
03:10  03:11	MALE:  Is that like the third floor here.
03:11  03:12	FEMALE:  Yeah, it's like the top of the railing.
03:13  03:13	MALE:  Okay.
03:14  03:19	FEMALE:  Sort of thing, actually it might be a little taller.  It might be more like the top.
03:20  03:21	MALE:  So if you miss and belly flop that would hurt.
03:21  03:31	FEMALE:  If you smack -- like, you don't want to smack off of 10 meters, that's like smacking off three meters is bad [unintelligible], you don't need to do it from any more height [laughter].
03:32  03:34	MALE:  So did you do ah, a Wolfe?
