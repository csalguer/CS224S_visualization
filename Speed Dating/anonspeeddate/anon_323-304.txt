0:24 0:28 MALE: I'm in, uh, engineering. electrical engineering same as nameX.
0:26 0:27 FEMALE: Oh. Did you guys come together?
0:30 0:31 MALE: No. But we've known each other.
0:32 0:32 FEMALE: Okay. So what brought you here to speed dating?
0:34 0:37 MALE: Find out, figured it would be--
0:36 0:36 FEMALE: Have you done it before?
0:39 0:39 MALE: What?
0:37 0:38 FEMALE: Have you ever done it before?
0:39 0:43 MALE: I did it once in Boston. I've been in Boston for the last couple of years.
0:41 0:42 FEMALE: Oh. Okay.
0:44 0:52 MALE: And I've been working so I just came here. I'm starting my Masters here so I've been here a little bit under a year. But I've been in Boston, it's been pretty fun.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE: What did you do in Boston?
0:55 1:00 MALE: What I did in Boston. I worked for MIT and placed some government research.
0:59 1:01 FEMALE: Okay. That's interesting.
1:04 1:04 MALE: Kind of.
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: Did you like Boston?
1:06 1:06 MALE: Not really.
1:06 1:06 FEMALE: I don't like Boston either.
1:08 1:09 MALE: What don't you like about it.
1:10 1:20 FEMALE: I don't know. I feel like everybody there likes it too much, they all think it's so great. I didn't really like it.  I thought the people were sort of stuffy and snobby.
1:22 1:25 MALE: Yeah. They drink a lot, too.
1:24 1:26 FEMALE: That's true. They do drink a lot, I didn't think about that.
1:28 1:28 MALE: Did you go to college in Boston?
1:28 1:30 FEMALE: No. I went to college in Pittsburgh.
1:32 1:32 MALE: Pittsburgh.
1:33 1:33 FEMALE: But I have a--
1:33 1:33 MALE: CMU?
1:34 1:43 FEMALE: Yeah. I went to CMU. I have a lot of good friends who moved to Boston, though, so I spent a lot of time there. I just, I don't know. I never really clicked with it.
1:46 1:46 MALE: Where are you from?
1:45 1:45 FEMALE: From New Jersey.
1:48 1:48 MALE: What part of New Jersey?
1:48 1:51 FEMALE: Bridgewater, New Jersey. Like, do you know where the Holland Tunnel is?
1:54 1:57 MALE: Uh, yeah I know it. I grew up in Brooklyn so.
1:54 2:07 FEMALE: Well it's 20 miles. Yeah. So if you go out through Brooklyn, through Manhattan, through the Holland Tunnel and 25 miles west you'll hit Bridgewater. So it's a fun place sort of. I don't regret moving out here.
2:08 2:11 MALE: Okay. So are you going to continue to stay out here or are you going to move?
2:10 2:16 FEMALE: I'm going to stay here for a little while. I'll probably go back eventually. So you grew up in Brooklyn?
2:17 2:17 MALE: Yeah.
2:17 2:17 FEMALE: Where in Brooklyn?
2:19 2:19 MALE: Bensonhurst.
2:18 2:21 FEMALE: Okay. Now how long? Did you leave when you went to college?
2:24 2:24 MALE: Yeah. Pretty much.
2:24 2:24 FEMALE: Where did you go to school?
2:27 2:27 MALE: Cal Tech in L.A.
2:26 2:29 FEMALE: Okay. So I guess you went to Boston then?
2:30 2:33 MALE: Yeah. I went to Boston but I'm pretty set on staying out here.
2:34 2:38 FEMALE: It must have been hard to go from L.A. to Boston.
2:40 2:44 MALE: It's all right. It's not a big deal. Whatever.
2:40 2:40 FEMALE: Oh really?
2:44 2:46 MALE: But what do you like to do here.
2:45 2:52 FEMALE: I like to go out. I like to go out to eat, I like to go out dancing, I like to go on hikes.
2:54 2:56 MALE: That seems to be a recurring theme with people here.
2:56 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah. You have to appreciate the weather. It's nice to be able to get outside 12 months of the year. How did you like L.A.?
3:06 3:17 MALE: It's all right. I feel like it's just too spread out. I kind of like it here, it's kind of a good balance between city life and town life.
3:17 3:18 FEMALE: Is L.A. just like one big suburb?
3:19 3:20 MALE: Yeah. Pretty much. That's what it seems like.
3:20 3:20 FEMALE: Really?
3:22 3:23 MALE: That's what it seems like. Have you been to L.A. before?
3:22 3:31 FEMALE: No. I've never been. I haven't heard too many good things about it so I haven't made the trip yet. I like San Diego, I've been there.
3:33 3:34 MALE: Oh yeah? What were you doing there?
3:35 3:39 FEMALE: When I was working, I had a business trip there for a week so that was nice.
3:41 3:50 MALE: I just spent like three or four days there. We got a hotel right next to Tiajuana. We just went in there and had some fun.
3:49 3:49 FEMALE: How as Tiajuana?
3:53 3:57 MALE: Nice. Nice place, little dirty.
3:55 3:55 FEMALE: Oh really, like noticeably?
3:58 3:58 MALE: Have you been there before?
3:58 3:58 FEMALE: No, I've never been to Mexico.
4:00 4:14 MALE: Yeah. It's a little-- I think it's just a big tourist attraction. That's the big problem with that. I think when you go a bit further south, you get the nice tropical beaches, a lot nicer food, things like that.
4:14 4:17 FEMALE: So it's just like a big party that gets dumped on?
4:18 4:21 MALE: Pretty much. It's a big party place.
4:20 4:20 FEMALE: That's too bad.
4:23 4:24 MALE: How are you enjoying your speed dating?
4:23 4:31 FEMALE: It's okay. [horn] Oh. I guess it's over now. But I thought it was fun. It was nice to meet you male304.
4:33 4:33 MALE: Okay. Take it easy.
4:34 4:34 FEMALE: Take care.
