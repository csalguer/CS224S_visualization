0:01 0:01 FEMALE: Hi.
0:03 0:04 MALE: Hi, how are you?
0:03 0:05 FEMALE: Getting a little bit tired, but doing okay, hanging in there.
0:07 0:08 MALE: [unintelligible]
0:06 0:14 FEMALE: I know, I know, I think I repeated like the same number of lines, you know, like 'cause what [unintelligible] I'm in, that's like the most relevant information, but-- 
0:15 0:20 MALE: There you go.  Conversation starts a little bit off course nowadays because, you know, you're tired of being [unintelligible]
0:17 0:28 FEMALE: You try, you try it, but then like you kind of have to have an idea of like, you know, what the person is doing, you know, and that kind of thing, it's important.  So, so might as well just get signed up.  What do you do?  What's your department?
0:29 0:32 MALE: Okay, so I'm in electrical engineering.
0:29 0:29 FEMALE: Okay.
0:32 0:36 MALE: And I do my doctoral degree.  I've been here for more years than you care to know, so don't ask.
0:34 0:36 FEMALE: I'm sure you haven't been for longer than I have.
0:39 0:39 MALE: Uh.  
0:37 0:38 FEMALE: Let's have a contest.  
0:41 0:41 MALE: I have been here-- [laughter]
0:39 0:40 FEMALE: [laughter] How long?  
0:43 0:47 MALE: Well, can we include all graduate education, or would only the ones taught here, at Stanford?
0:45 0:47 FEMALE: Only this one, how long have you been at Stanford, period.
0:49 0:50 MALE: Since '93.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE: Okay, yeah, you win.  [laughter]
0:52 0:53 MALE: [laughter]  So there.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE: You do win, in fact.
0:56 0:58 MALE: Well, really, '95, sorry, since '95.
0:56 0:58 FEMALE: That's still pretty long.  How-- did you do your undergrad here, or-- ?
1:01 1:01 MALE: No, no-no-no-no-no.
1:00 1:02 FEMALE: Okay, so hot-- please explain--
1:01 1:04 MALE: But I've just been doing-- No.  [laughter]
1:03 1:04 FEMALE: Oh, you have to!  
1:06 1:07 MALE: First you have to tell me, when did you arrive here?
1:06 1:06 FEMALE: '99.
1:08 1:10 MALE: And you thought that you had so much seniority?
1:09 1:14 FEMALE: Well, I've been here six years, I mean, like that's a long time.  People have been like, "You've been here six years?"  I'm like, "Yeah."
1:16 1:19 MALE: Oh, okay.  Well, no, there are ways to be here longer.
1:18 1:19 FEMALE: [laughter] Apparently.  
1:21 1:24 MALE: That's right.  Well, you- 
1:21 1:22 FEMALE: Well, then.  
1:24 1:27 MALE: You just have to uh, you have to work half-time off campus.
1:26 1:27 FEMALE: Okay, that's a good way of doing it.
1:30 1:33 MALE: And you have to do an extra fellowship program, which requires an extra year of course work.
1:31 1:31 FEMALE: Okay.
1:34 1:36 MALE: And then you can also go on take [unintelligible] and so on.
1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Okay.
1:37 1:40 MALE: Then you have to have a variety of other extracurricular activities.
1:38 1:39 FEMALE: Activities, that you-- Okay.
1:41 1:44 MALE: And so then you have to change your major defense series.
1:43 1:43 FEMALE: Okay.
1:45 1:49 MALE: From, not the whole major, but from high speed [unintelligible] electronics to computer architectures.
1:48 1:48 FEMALE: Okay.
1:51 1:53 MALE: And then there are a few other things, too.
1:51 1:51 FEMALE: [laughter]
1:53 1:53 MALE: [laughter]
1:52 1:54 FEMALE: Impressive, wow, okay.  
1:55 1:57 MALE: It'll add, It'll add to it.  
1:55 1:57 FEMALE: Are you at least close to being done, or-- 
1:59 2:00 MALE: Oh, yeah.
1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Okay, good.
2:01 2:02 MALE: Probably within about six months now.
2:00 2:02 FEMALE: Well, that's good, well good, congratulations.  Impressive.
2:03 2:05 MALE: And how about you, what are you-- what's your-- ?
2:03 2:05 FEMALE: I'm in medicine and neuroscience, so M.D./Ph.D.
2:07 2:08 MALE: Oo-whee..  
2:06 2:08 FEMALE: So, by the end, I'll be like you.  
2:10 2:11 MALE: Oh, yeah.  [laughter]
2:09 2:16 FEMALE: Because I was also, I also went undergrad here, so that's four years, and then medicine is four years, and a Ph.D. will probably be four years, so 12 years total.  So--
2:18 2:18 MALE: Wow.
2:17 2:20 FEMALE: In 2011, I will have been here for 12 years.
2:22 2:23 MALE: For 12 years, okay.  
2:21 2:26 FEMALE: So, it's not exactly, no, you were here in '95, so ten years, so I will-- eventually I will beat you.  
2:25 2:27 MALE: No I was-- I've done [unintelligible]
2:27 2:29 FEMALE: Eventually, I'll be much better.  
2:29 2:32 MALE: Yeah, that's right.  I did a degree before this, too.
2:30 2:31 FEMALE: But not at Stanford?
2:34 2:34 MALE: Not at Stanford. [laughter]
2:32 2:36 FEMALE: See, I'm counting only the Stanford degree, I'm not counting education total.
2:38 2:41 MALE: Undergraduate, my first masters, then we'd have a lot more years to talk about.  [laughter]
2:39 2:42 FEMALE: Oh, god.  Okay, well done.  Where'd you do your undergrad?
2:45 2:46 MALE: Harvard.  How about you?
2:44 2:46 FEMALE: Okay.  Here, yeah.
2:47 2:49 MALE: Here, you told me that, already.  That's right.  And so--
2:47 2:53 FEMALE: You know, it's all good.  See, I don't think we can count fully all the years that you spent here, though, because you are working on the side.
2:53 2:54 MALE: Oh, there you go.
2:54 2:58 FEMALE: So like so like you're doing it kind of half time and you're getting paid, so that's not really full-time student-hood.
3:00 3:04 MALE: That's right.  [unintelligible] snob, well, what's up, you're trying to win this, aren't you?  [laughter]
3:02 3:13 FEMALE: I-I'm feeling very competitive right now, and I think that like, you know, oh, I mean, if you're doing half-time student, then like we should count it as half-time.  So, the very most, you've been here five years, so you still, I think I beat you, therefore.  [laughter]
3:16 3:20 MALE: Yeah, I'll try to sell it to my advisor.  You should do it, probably.
3:17 3:18 FEMALE: [laughter]
3:20 3:21 MALE: You're much more convincing.
3:19 3:21 FEMALE: Good.  Maybe we could set it up.
3:23 3:24 MALE: So what do you like to do in your spare time?
3:23 3:27 FEMALE: In my spare time.  I like to dance a lot.  I do a lot of ballroom dancing, like um-- 
3:29 3:30 MALE: Ballroom dancing, very nice.
3:27 3:32 FEMALE: Yeah, like social dance, so like waltz, swing, salsa, that kind of thing.  Um.
3:33 3:33 MALE: Awesome.
3:32 3:45 FEMALE: Yeah, everything.  Um, so that's like probably the main thing, and then just like other things are not incredibly specific, it's like, you know, I like to read, and like to travel, and I like to go to museums, and I like to go to theater, you know, that kind of thing.  So.
3:47 3:47 MALE: That's great.  
3:46 3:48 FEMALE: You know, that's roughly what I do.  Yourself?
3:51 3:52 MALE: That's pretty diverse.  [laughter]
3:51 3:55 FEMALE: I don't know, I mean like, it could be put in like dancing and cultural stuff.
3:57 3:58 MALE: So, you have two.
[horn]
3:56 3:59 FEMALE: So two boxes really.  Okay, give me brief, like very briefly.
4:01 4:04 MALE: Well, I like to uh, watch movies, and--
4:01 4:01 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
4:04 4:05 MALE: --go to amusement parks.
4:03 4:04 FEMALE: Okay, that's cool.
4:06 4:07 MALE: [unintelligible] kind of activities.
4:05 4:07 FEMALE: That's awesome.  Nice meeting you.
4:08 4:08 MALE: Nice meeting you.
