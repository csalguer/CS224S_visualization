0:00 0:01 FEMALE: Hi.  

0:01 0:02 MALE: Hey, female221.  Nice to meet you.  

0:02 0:03 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, too.  So what do you do?

0:04 0:10 MALE: I am a mechanical engineering Master's student, and I'll be finishing this quarter, and then I'll be doing another Master's in aerospace. 

0:11 0:11 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

0:11 0:12 MALE: - starting next quarter.

0:12 0:13 FEMALE: And then what?

0:14 0:16 MALE: And then I'm going to try to be an astronaut.

0:17 0:17 FEMALE: Really?

0:18 0:21 MALE: Everybody does.  But probably what I'll be doing is design rockets.  Hopefully.

0:22 0:23 FEMALE: That's pretty close.

0:24 0:25 MALE: Or space vehicles.  That's more of the generic term.

0:26 0:29 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  Awesome.  What did you do before Stanford?

0:30 0:32 MALE: I worked as an engineer for Proctor & Gamble.

0:33 0:33 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

0:34 0:36 MALE: And I worked on Crest toothpaste and toothpaste tubes.

0:37 0:37 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.   

0:38 0:42 MALE: I worked for Crest White Strips, so one of my toothbrushes got to market and a toothpaste tube.

0:43 0:45 FEMALE: Awesome.  That's interesting.

0:46 0:47 MALE: And then I worked on Always.

0:47 0:48 FEMALE: What's that?  P&G?

0:49 0:53 MALE: Always.  Yeah.  I didn't design the product, for obvious reasons, but I did design the machinery that made the product.

0:54 0:54 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

0:55 0:58 MALE: And then I decided that I wanted to do aerospace, and I was nowhere close to do it.

0:59 1:01 FEMALE: Yeah, that's quite a difference.  

1:01 1:02 MALE: Yeah. 

1:02 1:02 FEMALE: A jump.

1:02 1:02 MALE: Right.

1:03 1:04 FEMALE: Did you have to kind of prep up for that by taking courses, or did you just jump in and kind of learn as you went?

1:05 1:09 MALE: Uh, you mean -- oh, aerospace courses?

1:10 1:10 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:11 1:11 MALE: I already knew.

1:11 1:12 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  

1:13 1:14 MALE: I knew since I was little but I just couldn't be because of the [unintelligible].

1:14 1:14 FEMALE: Got it.

1:15 1:18 MALE: But then because of the X-Prize, it changed the market significantly.  

1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Right.

1:20 1:20 MALE: So now I'm [unintelligible].

1:20 1:20 FEMALE: Cool.

1:21 1:21 MALE: What do you do?

1:21 1:24 FEMALE: Uh, I'm a first-year PhD student in Russian literature.

1:24 1:25 MALE:  In Russian literature?

1:25 1:25 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:26 1:26 MALE: Okay.  My sister speaks Russian.

1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Really?

1:28 1:28 MALE: Yeah.

1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:29 1:29 MALE: She taught me a few words, and -

1:29 1:29 FEMALE: What do you know?

1:30 1:31 MALE: I forgot.

1:31 1:31 FEMALE: [laughter].  You forgot them all.

1:32 1:33 MALE: I mean if I heard it, I would know.

1:33 1:33 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:34 1:34 MALE: She taught me "hello," and -

1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  [speaks Russian]. 

1:36 1:36 MALE: - I just don't remember.

1:36 1:36 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:37 1:38 MALE: And then she went to Russia twice.

1:39 1:39 FEMALE: Yeah?

1:40 1:41 MALE: So she was on the first foreign exchange program from the U.S. to Russia.

1:42 1:43 FEMALE: When was that?

1:44 1:47 MALE: It was in 1989.  She met Bush.

1:48 1:48 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

1:49 1:49 MALE: And she met Gorbachev.

1:50 1:50 FEMALE: That's awesome. 

1:50 1:51 2:28 MALE: Yeah.

1:51 1:59 FEMALE: Very cool, yeah.  It's a great field, it's very interesting.  It's a very complex, crazy country.  But there's lots of good art and literature and...

2:00 2:03 MALE: So, you must have dived in, right into graduate school, right, when you came out of undergrad?

2:04 2:07 FEMALE: No, actually I worked for five years and went to law school for a year and a half.

2:08 2:08 MALE: Oh, really?

2:08 2:09 FEMALE: Yeah.  And then I decided I didn't want to be a lawyer.

2:10 2:11 MALE: Okay.

2:11 2:13 FEMALE: And I wanted to come back to school, so...

2:13 2:13 MALE: Okay.

2:13 2:13 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:14 2:14 MALE: Cool.

2:15 2:29 FEMALE: Yeah, it was a good choice.  I mean, I liked law school, I always like school, but I worked in some really horrible law firms, where people were, you know, "If you want 50 reasons not to be a lawyer, come talk to me," and you know, horrible morale, and you know, so it just didn't seem very appealing.

2:30 2:30 MALE: Yeah.

2:30 2:34 FEMALE: Then I worked in a firm that was really great, and if I'd actually worked there before I decided to switch, then maybe I wouldn't have.

2:35 2:37 MALE: So what motivated you to do Russian?  Do you have a Russian background?

2:38 2:50 FEMALE: No, no.  The story goes, when I was 11 years old, I went to Japan for junior art camp, and there were kids from all over the world there, and there was this cute Russian boy who winked at me all week.  And that was it, then I wanted to learn Russian.

2:50 2:50 MALE: Oh, I see.

2:50 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  [laughter].

2:51 2:52 MALE: Cool.

2:52 2:53 FEMALE: Yeah, so, um, I studied it in high school and college, and -  

2:53 2:57 MALE: Where did you go to college?

2:58 2:59 FEMALE: Uh, Dartmouth.

3:00 3:00 MALE: Oh, okay, great.

3:01 3:02 FEMALE: How about you?

3:03 3:03 MALE: I went to Carnegie-Mellon.

3:03 3:03 FEMALE: Oh.

3:04 3:04 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:04 3:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  Where are you from, originally?

3:07 3:08 MALE:  I'm from Houston.

3:08 3:09 FEMALE:  How do you like California?

3:09 3:10 MALE:  It's much better.  It's the best place I've ever lived.

3:11 3:11 FEMALE: Really?

3:12 3:14 MALE: The weather's great.  I like the fact that it's cold at night.

3:15 3:19 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of a nice change, so you're not sweltering during the night.

3:20 3:20 MALE: You don't need any AC.

3:20 3:20 FEMALE: Right.

3:21 3:22 MALE: Or [unintelligible] AC when you go to bed.

3:22 3:49 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah, I like it, too.  I uh -- even though I'm just -- I'm from Oregon, originally, and uh, I have this kind of in-bred hatred of California, because the myth goes that Californians move up to Oregon and ruin our beautiful state.  But, um -- so I refused to consider going to school here or ever living here, until I came home after college and realized that I really wanted some sun, and uh, even though -- I mean I know Northern California is, you know, not like Southern California, I just kind of expected to be in shorts and t-shirt all the time.

3:50 3:50 MALE: Okay. 

3:50 3:54 FEMALE: But it's nice to kind of -- it's similar to home, the weather.  Just only a little better.

3:55 3:55 MALE: Right. 

3:55 3:56 FEMALE: Yeah, so it's nice.

3:57 3:57 [Background Noise]

3:58 3:59 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

3:59 3:59 MALE: Nice to meet you.

4:00 4:00 FEMALE: Bye.
