0:00:08.4  0:00:08.7  FEMALE: Okay. 
0:00:12.1  0:00:29.3  MALE: I am in physicist department.  I'm getting a PhD.  But I work with a professor in the biology department [unintelligible] to combine to [unintelligible] gather to form a [unintelligible] system.  One is MR, the other is X-ray
0:00:25.9  0:00:31.5  FEMALE:  Wow.  [laughter] You are in the physicist department and you are working with biology.
0:00:34.9  0:00:36.5  MALE: Radiology.
0:00:33.1  0:00:38.6  FEMALE: Oh radiology.  How long have you been working on this project?
0:00:42.0  0:00:42.7  MALE:  Um, about five years.
0:00:39.3  0:00:41.8  FEMALE: Five years, wow.
0:00:45.2  0:00:53.5  MALE:  So I like um, [unintelligible] things.  I liek technology.  Anda ah, I enjoy sports.
0:00:50.1  0:00:52.5  FEMALE:  What sports do you play?
0:00:55.9  0:01:04.9  MALE:  I play tennis, badminton, play table tennis,ocassionally volleyball, and I practice [unintelligible].
0:01:01.5  0:01:07.5  FEMALE: Oh wow you are very active.  How do you find time to do that when you are in the middle of such a project.
0:01:10.9  0:01:15.4  MALE:  I just postpone, postpone my work. 
0:01:12.0  0:01:15.4  FEMALE:  Ah the old ah, procrastination tactic. 
0:01:18.8  0:01:18.8  MALE:  Yeah. 
0:01:15.4  0:01:17.0  FEMALE:  I know that one well. 
0:01:20.4  0:01:25.6  MALE:  That's ah, the reason why I haven't graduated yet.  How about you? 
0:01:22.2  0:01:33.4  FEMALE:  I'm actually in the school of education I am working on mathematics education for high school students.
0:01:36.8  0:01:37.3  MALE:  For kids?
0:01:33.9  0:01:33.6  FEMALE: Yeah, high school students so...
0:01:40.4  0:01:43.5  MALE: So you're going to be a high school teacher. 
0:01:40.1  0:01:55.6  FEMALE:  Yeah I think so, for a couple of years.  I'm really interested in how mathematics is taught and who has access to it and a lot of -- I am interested in all of the political issues around education in our country.
0:01:59.0  0:02:07.7  MALE:  I guess most high school kids find mathematics to be [unintelligible]. 
0:02:00.0  0:02:25.8  FEMALE:  Yeah.  I mean math was just such a bad rep in our American culture, you know you will commonly find--especially women--but a lot of people saying I am bad at math and I don't like math and what not.  You would never hear someone say that about English right?  No one would ever say oh I am horrible at English like don't ask me any English questions. 
0:02:29.2  0:02:33.6  MALE: Do you think it probably part of the reason is the way math is taught?
0:02:30.2  0:02:57.7  FEMALE:  I think a huge part of the reason is the way it is taught. I think that it's accessible to just a certain type of learner, one who is good at memorizing and one who is good at organizing on their own which are really important things in mathematics.   But I think that in education we can teach kids how to organize if they don't already have that we can teach ways to organize yourself and to organize your thoughts and things.
0:03:01.4  0:03:04.9  MALE:  So you are trying to change the image of math so that would be more popular. 
0:03:04.3  0:03:19.1  FEMALE:  Yeah.  I mean, that's not my primary goal.  My primary goal is for everyone to learn math.  But I think that through change and image that would affect kids to want to learn better.
0:03:22.5  0:03:25.9  MALE:  What do you do for fun, in your spare time?
0:03:22.5  0:03:31.1  FEMALE:  I don't have much spare time right now because my program is just a year long.  But I, I used to play soccer in college.
0:03:34.5  0:03:34.7  MALE:  Oh really. 
0:03:31.3  0:03:37.1  FEMALE:  I try to get out and hit tennis balls when I can.  I like to dance.
0:03:40.5  0:03:41.7  MALE:  What kind of dance?
0:03:38.3  0:03:48.9  FEMALE:  Ah, I usually do just like jazz dance.  But I also just like jamming in my room or whatever.  Whenever I have free times I like to put the music on and dance around. 
0:03:52.3  0:03:53.9  MALE:  What kind of music do you like? 
0:03:50.5  0:03:53.4  FEMALE:  I like everything, How about you?
0:03:56.8  0:04:00.7  MALE:  I like pop and sometimes I like classic.
