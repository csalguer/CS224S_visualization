0:01 0:02 MALE: What's going on? I'm male303.
0:03 0:03 FEMALE: Hi. I'm female323.
0:03 0:03 MALE: female323?
0:04 0:04 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.
0:05 0:05 MALE: How you doing?
0:06 0:06 FEMALE: Good how are you?
0:06 0:07 MALE: A little bit weird but.
0:08 0:10 FEMALE: Yeah. It's kind of weird. Have you done this before?
0:10 0:11 MALE: I actually haven't.
0:11 0:12 FEMALE: No? Why'd you do this now?
0:13 0:21 MALE: I don't know. I just thought it'd be something different. I'm in business school and my whole world is business school. So to get outside of business school, I thought it would be fun.
0:22 0:24 FEMALE: Is it two years, that is business school?
0:24 0:24 MALE: Yes.
0:24 0:25 FEMALE: So are you first year or second?
0:25 0:25 MALE: First year.
0:25 0:26 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
0:27 0:27 MALE: And what school are you going?
0:28 0:29 FEMALE: Education.
0:29 0:30 MALE: Okay. So you're here a lot, huh?
0:30 0:31 FEMALE: Yeah. It's kind of weird.
0:32 0:33 MALE: Are you at Cumberly a lot as well?
0:34 0:40 FEMALE: No. It's just pretty much here. I'm in the step program, the teacher educator program. So it's right upstairs.
0:41 0:43 MALE: So what are you hoping to do when you finish?
0:43 0:48 FEMALE: I'm going to have a credential to teach high school math. So it's a Masters degree and a teaching credential.
0:49 0:50 MALE: So algebra or geometry or what?
0:51 0:57 FEMALE: Whatever. I can teach seventh grade through twelfth grade so anything from whatever, adding negative numbers to calculus.
0:58 1:00 MALE: Okay. So what do you like to do outside of teaching?
1:01 1:03 FEMALE: Outside of teaching.
1:04 1:05 MALE: Outside of these four walls.
1:05 1:23 FEMALE: I prefer most things to being inside these four walls, but I don't know. I like to be outside. I grew up in the northeast so it's nice to be in a place where the weather is pretty nice. I like to go hiking. I like a lot of things, it's sort of awkward to... What about you? What do you like?
1:25 1:27 MALE: I mean, I like being outside. I was just on the golf course.
1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Oh. You were?
1:30 1:34 MALE: Though it's not kind of-- you don't get a lot of exercise but it's fun. It's very frustrating actually.
1:35 1:35 FEMALE: It's relaxing, isn't it?
1:36 1:40 MALE: It is relaxing. My mind is focused on one thing and that's playing golf. I can really get it.
1:41 1:46 FEMALE: I like driving golf balls. I've never actually played 18 holes. But I really like driving.
1:46 1:46 MALE: Why?
1:47 1:47 FEMALE: Why do I like driving golf balls?
1:48 1:51 MALE: Yeah. Why do you like the driving range, yes. [unintelligible]
1:51 2:03 FEMALE: No. [laughter] No I guess it's 'cause I don't have to be good at it.  It's one thing I can just-- I don't know anything about golf, I can just go and hit golf balls. It's still very satisfying. Like, it's not often that you're very satisfied by something you're not good at.  You know?
2:04 2:04 MALE: Yeah. It's true.
2:05 2:14 FEMALE: But it is, it's nice to just go in and hit golf balls. I like it when the little cart comes by and sucks them all up like vacuuming this big patch of grass.
2:15 2:16 MALE: Do you try to hit them? Do you try to hit it?
2:16 2:22 FEMALE: No. I don't do that. It doesn't seem very nice. There's that commercial, right, for like 7-Up.
2:23 2:24 MALE: Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know that one.
2:24 2:30 FEMALE: No. I never. I mean, frankly, I'm not even good enough to pretend like I can hit.
2:31 2:31 MALE: So did you move from the northeast just to come to school here?
2:32 2:43 FEMALE: No. I moved here three years ago. The program I'm in is one calendar year so it's June to June. I was working in New York City and I just kind of wanted to try something knew.
2:44 2:44 MALE: Where were you working?
2:45 2:50 FEMALE: I worked for a record label, Arista Records. So Arista was having--
2:51 2:52 MALE: The Real World people, right?
2:52 3:11 FEMALE: Yes. I worked there while the Real World people were there. It was the biggest crock, it was amazing. We even worked in this building, it was a dump. The executive floor was nice, where L.A. Reid sat was nice and then we had this attic when MTV came in. They just gutted the attic and made it this big. I mean, you saw where the kids worked. It was ridiculous.
3:12 3:14 MALE: That's quite a switch from record, music, entertaining to teaching?
3:17 3:37 FEMALE: Um, I don't know. I didn't find the music very fulfilling. I didn't feel like I was doing anything good. My main job was managing entourages when they went internationally on promotional tours. So it was just like constant battles with visas and plane tickets.
3:39 3:39 MALE: Yeah. You have to keep them out of jail?
3:41 3:45 FEMALE: We had a lot of problems with visas and jail, actually. Like, people not being able to travel abroad because they had a record. 
3:45 3:46 MALE: That was a joke.
3:47 3:51 FEMALE: It's true. So how did you decide? Where did you go to undergrad?
3:51 3:51 MALE: I went here.
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: Oh you did?
3:53 3:53 MALE: Yeah.
3:54 3:54 FEMALE: So did you go straight to the MBA?
3:54 3:57 MALE: No, no. I had four years out. I was in New York, that's why I asked.
3:58 3:59 FEMALE: Oh. What did you do in New York?
4:00 4:00 MALE: I did sports marketing.
4:03 4:07 FEMALE: Oh. It was nice to meet you. Have fun.
4:08 4:08 MALE: You, too.
