0:00 0:01 MALE:  How are you?
0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:02 0:02 MALE:  male308.
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male308.  I'm female328.
0:03 0:05 MALE:  I--I am sure this doesn't count, this--you know.
0:05 0:08 FEMALE:  I--probably not.  We're supposed to start our date.  This is pre-date.  This is--
0:08 0:08 MALE:  [interposing] No.  This is just predating.
0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  This is walking from the car to the wherever.
0:11 0:15 MALE:  Oh, that's just a perfect analogy.  But now I'm really curious what you're studying and--but I'll--I'll wait [laughter].
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  That's the sociology of dating.
0:19 0:22 MALE:  I mean, I was thinking what a great research topic this would be.
0:23 0:27 FEMALE2:  Do I know you?  You're friends with ah, what's her name?  Harvard?  Um--
0:28 0:29 FEMALE:  Natalya [phonetic], uh, Tracy.
0:29 0:33 FEMALE2:  Your friend was here last year hanging out with you with at the GS--
0:33 0:33 FEMALE:  Saneda [phonetic].
0:33 0:35 FEMALE2:  Saneda, yeah.  I'm her friend.
0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  Oh, awesome.
0:37 0:40 MALE:  So in any case, [laughter] are you a business school student?
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, second year.
0:41 0:43 MALE:  Cool.  Great.  Cool.  When--what?
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  And yourself?
0:43 0:44 MALE:  Oh, law school student.  Just--
0:44 0:44 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh cool.
0:45 0:50 MALE:  Well just officially finished my second.  Yeah, we had finals yesterday, so I'm like totally sleep deprived.
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  Oh, it's okay.
0:51 0:53 MALE:  What uh--what happens after this, do you know?
0:53 0:55 FEMALE:  Uh well, I graduate on the 12th.
0:55 0:55 MALE:  Congratulations.
0:55 0:57 FEMALE:  Thank you.  Hopefully, assuming all goes well.
0:57 0:59 MALE:  You never know.  But I feel good for you.
0:59 1:06 FEMALE:  Thank you.  Um so I've accepted a job back in consulting.  They're--they--they're paying for school, so it's a big check to write if I--
1:06 1:06 MALE:  [interposing] Really nice.
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  --if I blow them off.
1:07 1:07 MALE:  Which firm?
1:07 1:10 FEMALE:  Uh the Boston Consulting Group in San Francisco though.
1:11 1:13 MALE:  Oh sweet.  I had a bunch of friends who work for all the firms--
1:13 1:13 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
1:13 1:14 MALE:  --but not BCG in San Francisco.
1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  Oh.
1:15 1:16 MALE:  So that's new territory.
1:16 1:21 FEMALE:  It's a nice office.  I like it.  But I'm probably going to work for a startup over the summer.  I'm working with them now, and it's a lot of fun.
1:22 1:22 MALE:  Oh that's really cool.
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:23 1:25 MALE:  Do you get any time off to travel or celebrate in any way?
1:24 1:27 FEMALE:  I will take some time off.  There is no question.
1:27 1:27 MALE:  That's really nice.
1:27 1:30 FEMALE:  And I'm thinking maybe back to Thailand or to England.
1:31 1:32 MALE:  Are you from Thailand or China?
1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  No.
1:33 1:33 MALE:  Oh.
1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  My mom's from the Philippines, but um I grew up on Long Island.
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Oh.
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  female328 says Long Island.  But--
1:38 1:39 MALE:  [interposing] You--you don't mean Long Island, New York then?
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:40 1:40 MALE:  Oh, oh.
1:40 1:43 FEMALE:  Long Island.  I--I just don't have the big hair and nails to pull it off right now.
1:43 1:45 MALE:  I--well, you said back in Thailand, so I thought wow that's--
1:45 1:47 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh.  I was there--I--I was there before.
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1:48 1:48 FEMALE:  Sorry.
1:48 1:49 MALE:  Okay.  That's very cool.
1:49 1:51 FEMALE:  That was unclear.  And how about yourself?  You got--
1:51 1:51 MALE:  [interposing] Um--
1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  What are you doing this summer?
1:53 1:54 MALE:  Oh, so working for two firms up in San Francisco.
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:55 1:59 MALE:  Um really interested probably more in uh doing government work long term, but--
1:59 2:00 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh, interesting.
1:59 2:01 MALE:  --do that for a few years and kind of see where it leads, so.
2:01 2:03 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  What kind of government work?
2:03 2:06 MALE:  I'd love to do coronal [phonetic] prosecution, federal prosecutor-type stuff.
2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Oh, interesting.
2:06 2:08 MALE:  So um and then--
2:08 2:08 FEMALE:  [interposing] Why?
2:09 2:12 MALE:  Why?  Two reasons.  I mean, I think it's really interesting work.
2:12 2:12 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:12 2:14 MALE:  Um I didn't come to law school knowing that I wanted to do that--
2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
2:14 2:20 MALE:  --but I also think it's--you know, it's really challenging work.  You have a lot of discretions as a prosecutor, whether or not--
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
2:21 2:27 MALE:  --you're going to charge a person.  You get to decide, less so as a junior person especially in this administration, how you're going to charge them.
2:27 2:27 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:28 2:34 MALE:  But um I don't know, you know.  It's--it's kind of a tough challenge.  How are you going to deter a crime but also--
2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
2:34 2:38 MALE:  --enforce the right amount of punishment?  So that kind of thing interests me.
2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  Oh, that's cool.
2:39 2:40 MALE:  Um but we'll see how it all plays out.
2:41 2:45 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Had--had--had you been involved in that sort of thing before school?
2:45 2:46 MALE:  I actually worked in business.
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:46 2:48 MALE:  I was doing product management at Microsoft before law school--
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh, interesting.
2:48 2:49 MALE:  --which I loved.
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:50 2:54 MALE:  Um and uh I just somehow got the bug for law.  Maybe from all the antitrust stuff, so.
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  [laughter].
2:55 2:59 MALE:  I mean, how did you um--did you go into consulting knowing that you wanted to stay in business long term?
2:59 3:09 FEMALE:  Well, I went into consulting knowing that I liked what I had seen so far, and I wanted to see how it would go.  And I figured it was a good opportunity to--to learn a bunch of stuff and keep a bunch of doors open.
3:10 3:10 MALE:  Oh, absolutely.
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  So it was--it had great option value.
3:13 3:18 MALE:  How does the experience differ--I guess--is the term consulting now?  Were you an a--an associate then consultant or--
3:18 3:27 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.  At BCG, that's the--it's associate then consultant.  Um its--yeah.  That's actually kind of the big issue for me is that I was--I was promoted already before school--
3:27 3:27 MALE:  [interposing] Oh wow.
3:28 3:31 FEMALE:  --so--and I just think it's not that different.  So--
3:31 3:33 MALE:  [interposing] It's--yeah.  A little maybe, anticlimactic. 
3:33 3:33 FEMALE:  And I'll get to work with some different--
3:34 3:34 MALE:  [interposing] But if you like it.
3:34 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's--it's not bad if you don't need to be home that often.
3:39 3:39 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:40 3:44 FEMALE:  So um when you're single and have no cats, it's all right.  [laughter].
3:45 3:49 MALE:  Even in San Francisco?  I'm presuming there's a lot of work around.  Have you been traveling a lot?
3:49 3:54 FEMALE:  Um yeah.  There's some work, and they're--they're okay about it when they can be.
3:55 3:55 MALE:  Yeah.
3:55 4:00 FEMALE:  But I spent three months in New York and three months in--commuting to Seattle.
4:01 4:04 MALE:  Which would be great, right, until you have the cats and then family--
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4:05 4:09 MALE:  --and--but um that's pretty cool.  Do you have this particular sector that you focus in?
4:09 4:12 FEMALE:  Retail and consumer goods.  So Seattle is not Microsoft.
4:13 4:13 MALE:  Starbucks.
4:14 4:14 FEMALE:  No. 
4:15 4:15 MALE:  Wow.
4:15 4:17 FEMALE:  A certain cruise line--
4:17 4:18 MALE:  [interposing] Oh that's sweet.
4:18 4:21 FEMALE:  --which was my favorite--yeah.  That--that was the hardship project.
4:22 4:29 MALE:  Well though it's great because, I mean, you go in Seattle and you meet someone and probability is right, it's like Amazon, Starbucks or Microsoft, so.
4:29 4:29 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
4:30 4:35 MALE:  I would have felt very fortunate to meet someone who's affiliated with neither of those three companies, but.
4:35 4:35 FEMALE:  [laughter].
4:36 4:37 MALE:  How have you liked the business school here?
4:37 4:40 FEMALE:  Um I've enjoyed it.  It--it actually involves some work.
4:41 4:45 MALE:  I knew it would.  I did not believe the people who said they got it better than we did.
4:45 4:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:46 4:46 MALE:  It was really good to meet you.
4:46 4:48 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
4:48 4:48 MALE:  Good luck.
4:49 4:49 FEMALE:  See you male308.
