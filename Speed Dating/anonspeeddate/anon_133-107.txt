0:09 0:09 MALE:  Hi, female133.  
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  Hi.  
0:10 0:11 MALE:  So, which school are you?  
0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  I study economics.  
0:13 0:19 MALE:  Economics?  I'm in the school of education.  I'm a PhD student here.  
0:18 0:24 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  [unintelligible] PhD in [unintelligible] take classes and stuff?  
0:26 0:29 MALE:  Yes, some of them do actually because they have a whole program in economics of education.  
0:29 0:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, a couple of [unintelligible] to their advisor makes them [unintelligible] the sky.  
0:36 0:41 MALE:  Must be nameX.  Must be nameX, yeah, nameX [phonetic].  
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  I don't know.  
0:42 0:42 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:41 0:43 FEMALE:  He could [unintelligible] actually.  
0:45 0:46 MALE:  Which year are you in?  
0:46 0:48 FEMALE:  I'm second year.  [unintelligible] third year.
0:51 0:54 MALE:  [unintelligible] .  Who was speaking in the honors classes?  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE:  nameX.  
0:56 0:56 MALE:  nameX [phonetic].  
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:57 0:59 MALE:  I don't know her at all.  I just know her through people.  
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:00 1:14 MALE:  I can see the person.  Yeah, she must have. A lot of them will take a lot of classes actually to get their Master's.  [unintelligible].  Yeah, I remember one person was taking a [unintelligible] class last quarter and they were like, oh my god.  
1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:15 1:20 MALE:  It was a nightmare for them.  But I guess I don't know [unintelligible] department chair, so it makes sense.  
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:21 1:28 MALE:  So, [unintelligible] it makes sense.  So, what else? What are your interests?  What do you like to do?  
1:28 1:36 FEMALE:  Well, I'm in the second year so I still [unintelligible].  So, I don't have a lot of free time.  In summer I like hiking.  
1:37 1:38 MALE:  Okay.  
1:37 1:39 FEMALE:  I'm originally from Indianapolis.  
1:40 1:43 MALE:  Uh-huh, there's someone else from there.  
1:41 1:43 FEMALE:  I got to move out here.  
1:44 1:48 MALE:  Yeah, you're in the right place if you like hiking.  Stanford is the place.  It's really nice around here.  
1:48 1:49 FEMALE:  What do you like to do?  
1:50 2:06 MALE:  What do I like to do?  I like to go to movies.  I like to go to dinners.  I like listening to music.  I run.  I like running on campus usually and sometimes hiking and outdoor activities.  So, yeah, now that I'm in my third year and I'm done with all my coursework and everything--
2:05 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.  
2:08 2:23 MALE:  Yeah, it's like I know what my research is on, and I have like more time.  I can take more time out.  My weekends are actually free, and I'm not studying for something or the other.  So, is the economics department fairly intensive as far as courses go?  
2:23 2:37 FEMALE: The first couple of years.  You have two years of courses, and I think most people in my program--getting out of one class next year is [unintelligible].  And then after that it's less intense until you start thinking about your dissertation.  
2:38 2:41 MALE:  Right, right, yeah.  That's tough.  
2:41 2:49 FEMALE:  Third year, I guess someone from the [unintelligible] department said that the third year, oh, we don't really know what they do.  But then the fourth year is [unintelligible].  
2:50 2:51 MALE:  Right, right.  
2:51 2:56 FEMALE:  I think it's because of attitudes [unintelligible] .  I'm looking forward to it.
2:57 3:03 MALE:  Yeah.  So, what are your interests are, academic interests and what are you interested in in economics?  
3:02 3:08 FEMALE: Well, discipline and [unintelligible] organizations and [unintelligible] relation.  
3:09 3:10 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  Kind of like applied questions.  
3:12 3:12 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:12 3:15 FEMALE:  I really haven't--you know, I'm just starting to write proposals now.  
3:16 3:17 MALE:  Right, right, right.  
3:16 3:18 FEMALE:  So, I can't really [unintelligible].  
3:20 3:48 MALE:  No, no, that's fine, broadly.  I mean I also look at, I'm in the school, but the kind of research I do is very different because I look at technology used within organizations and how the organizations use technology especially when they are in different countries and people are working together with each other.  So those kinds of set ups.  So, I work with people in management, science and engineering and here.  So, that's [unintelligible] slight different than what other people--
3:47 3:47 FEMALE:  [interposing]  How did you get into that?  
3:51 4:08 MALE:  I'm an engineer, but [unintelligible] engineering, and I used to work in a firm that used to have [unintelligible] development across countries and stuff. So, I came here for a Master's, and then developed  program here in learning and stuff, technology.  So, I kind of applied for that and got in. It's pretty interesting.  Nice meeting you.  
4:08 4:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, nice meeting you.
