0:53 1:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think I'm really a city girl, I lived in New York for eight years before I came back to school, so I think I'm gonna head up to San Francisco.  Oh, good, we get to start.
1:03 1:07 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible].  So how have you found Stanford, like being out in the suburbs the last few years?
1:07 1:08 FEMALE:  A little bit confusing, I have to say.
1:08 1:09 MALE:  Oh, yeah?
1:09 1:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.  My program's actually just a one year program, so you know, there's not a lot of time to adjust and get used to [unintelligible] here.
1:16 1:17 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:17 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, actually, I have managed to get around a little bit.  I like to go up to the city and go out and dance and that kind of stuff.   [laughter]  I hope we don't have to backtrack.  What about yourself, what do you like to do?
1:35 1:42 MALE:    I am pretty active.  I do a lot of exercise.  I just did a triathlon this weekend.

1:44 1:45 MALE:  Which was my first triathlon. 
1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  Oh, how'd you do?
1:48 1:51 MALE:  Um, pretty good.  It was a really long, long day.
1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  [laughter] I could imagine.
1:51 1:52 MALE:  About six hours of pain.
1:53 1:54 FEMALE:  Wow.
1:54 1:59 MALE:  But I think maybe like this is the last chance to get really fit before I head back into the real world -

2:36 2:36 MALE:  Paris?
2:36 2:50 FEMALE:  I did in Paris and um, a couple years ago I had a chance to go and visit some friends that were living in Nairobi and Kenya, so that was really awesome.  I got to go on safari and do the whole kind of -

3:08 3:09 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:09 3:10 FEMALE:  Cry me a river.
3:11 3:12 MALE:  But I have a question about Paris, [unintelligible].
3:14 3:16 FEMALE:  I do.  I actually knew a girl who lived there for a while.
3:16 3:17 MALE:  I lived there for a while as well.
3:18 3:30 FEMALE:  Really?  No way.  She told -- my friends name was nameX and she had lived there a couple years before she moved back and I moved back and we were in classes together.  So are all the stories they say true?
3:30 3:31 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:30 3:34 FEMALE:  There's a grumpy old man cleaning the floors with newspapers, that's what I got.
3:34 3:36 MALE:  Yeah, that's' such an experience.
3:36 3:37 FEMALE:  I can imagine.  I can imagine.
3:39 3:50 MALE:  No, [unintelligible] appreciation for literature before I went there but this old man said you have to read a book everyday and on the walls were like all these letters from great authors, Hemingway and [unintelligible] and everything.
3:50 3:55 FEMALE:  That's amazing.  That's great.  So did you meet like some crazy people there or with -
3:57 4:04 MALE:  There was a lot of artists there, so by definition of crazy people, which is kind of cool.  A little bit difference [unintelligible] people that you meet in business school.
4:05 4:09 FEMALE:  Oh, absolutely.  So when was this?  Just a couple years ago or?
4:10 4:12 MALE:  This was -- this was actually seven years ago.
4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  Oh.
4:14 4:15 MALE:  1998.
4:15 4:21 FEMALE:   That's -- that's actually around the time that I lived in France.  I was there studying abroad my junior year.
4:21 4:22 MALE:  So you speak French?
4:22 4:25 FEMALE:  [Speaking] yeah.
4:26 4:30 MALE:  I studied it for a couple years but then I learned Spanish and -
4:30 4:31 FEMALE:  So just kind of erased it.
4:31 4:32 MALE:  Destroyed my French.
4:33 4:36 FEMALE:  So have you ever had the chance to visit a Spanish speaking country?
4:36 4:39 MALE:  I actually went to -- I spent six months in Guatemala -
4:39 4:46 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  Fantastic.  So did you work there or just trek around or -
4:45 4:48 MALE:  Did some volunteering at an orphanage and um -
4:48 4:48 FEMALE:  That's great.
4:49 4:57 MALE:  On a coffee plantation with some locals and [unintelligible] so kind of a little bit of everything.
4:57 4:58 FEMALE:  Oh, that's great.
4:59 4:59 MALE:  Yeah.
4:58 4:59 FEMALE:  It's amazing.
4:58 5:06 MALE:  But I love traveling, so it's just something that I always do.  [unintelligible] such differentiated coming from Australia because pretty much everyone likes to travel.
5:07 5:20 FEMALE:  So true.  So true.  I have to say all the Australians I've met have been big world travelers.  Although it's been pointed out to me that it's because I've never been to Australia.  So, it's very nice to meet you.  Nice to talk to you.
5:20 5:21 MALE:  Yeah.
