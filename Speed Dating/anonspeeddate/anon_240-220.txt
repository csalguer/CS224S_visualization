0:35 0:36 MALE:  Yeah, that'll be fun in New York.
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, it will.
0:38 0:41 MALE:  So, are, are you from back east or?
0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  No, actually I'm from here, so.
0:42 0:43 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:43 0:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, I basically lived in the Bay Area my whole like.  Um, that's one of the reasons why I want to go to New York because, I don't know.  Being here 27 years is [laughter] enough for me [laughter].  Oh...
0:54 0:57 MALE:  Okay, so we can start.  Don't start yet.
0:58 1:03 FEMALE:  [laughter] I guess you should just sit here in silence and stare at each other [laughter].  
1:06 1:07 MALE:  So she said, don't start yet, right?
1:08 1:12 FEMALE:  I have no idea.  Um, but, yeah, so what department are you in?
1:13 1:14 MALE:  Um, I'm in engineering, yeah.
1:14 1:15 FEMALE:  Which kind, what kind?
1:14 1:15 MALE:  Electrical engineering.
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
1:16 1:26 MALE:  So I do like, okay.  So, yeah, I'd, I work on like ultra sound imaging systems for um.
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.
1:27 1:33 MALE:  Yeah, I do like electronics and stuff for um, like inter, intravascular imaging, and things like that.
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Oh, cool, what year are you?
1:35 1:36 MALE:  I'm sixth year.
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  Sixth, are you almost out of here or no?
1:38 1:44 MALE:  Uh, yeah, I, I think I'm going to be done um, probably in December or like next, next winter.
1:44 1:45 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, awesome.
1:46 1:48 MALE:  Yeah, so I don't get to, it'll be good to graduate, so.
1:47 2:10 FEMALE:  [laughter] no, I mean, being a law student, like I didn't know that it was um, actually rude to ask PhD students like, oh so when do you think you're going to be out of here because um, my friend who's a PhD in engineering, electrical engineering actually.  He's like, you know, that's a really rude question to ask.  And I was like, I had no idea.  Like, I mean, we're different because we don't write dissertations, so it's pretty much, you know you just have to finish three years and you're done [laughter].
2:11 2:20 MALE:  Yeah.  I don't think, man, I don't think, I guess uh, yeah, I guess.  Well there are some people that are around for so long maybe they're kind of embarrassed that they've been here so long, so.
2:20 2:25 FEMALE:  My friend's been here seven years.  But I think that that's, it's normal for his department within engineering actually so.
2:25 2:28 MALE:  Yeah, it, it also depends on your advisor, so.
2:28 2:29 FEMALE:  Oh really?
2:29 2:36 MALE:  Yeah, I mean if.  Yeah, and you're, sort of you're personality and you're, and also you're research, some people just [unintelligible].
2:36 2:39 FEMALE:  So, I guess you're research is going well because you're going to be out of here in December?
2:40 2:52 MALE:  Yeah, it's going, it's going pretty good.  Uh, yeah, it's, I mean, it's a pretty well defined project so it's just of matter of um, sort of completing the stuff and getting, getting out of here.  You know so it's good.
2:53 2:55 FEMALE:  Awesome and then you get to defend and do all that stuff?
2:56 3:11 MALE:  Yeah, so that's not.  I guess it's not, I mean, I guess in humanities it even a bigger deal because you have to; I mean that's sort of your main thing.  But in, in engineering we just do um.  And we'll usually have a bunch of papers and you can just sort of put those together for a thesis, so. 
3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  [laughter].
3:12 3:16 MALE:  I don't know and some people always literally just staple they're papers together and write an introduction.
3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Oh, are you serious?
3:16 3:30 MALE:  Yeah, it's not, I, I don't know, yeah, it's not, it's not.  Because it's, you put a lot of effort into it, but then probably.  I mean a lot people read the, read you're papers but, maybe no one will ever read you're thesis.  So in some ways it kind of makes sense not to, not to spend a lot of time on it, but.
3:31 3:37 FEMALE:  No, I mean, that sounds like such a great way to write a thesis.  I mean you just like staple all your past work together and just be like, yeah, here you are [laughter].
3:36 3:37 MALE:  Right.
3:38 3:50 FEMALE:  You wouldn't even have to like kind of like, grab a section here, grab a section there and like, you know morph it into like a big thing.  Just be like, oh, okay, you know [laughter], just blatantly [unintelligible] the other work.
3:50 3:51 MALE:  What's that?
3:51 3:53 FEMALE:  Just like, it's blatantly from other work that I've done.  
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Oh, okay.
3:53 4:02 FEMALE:  I mean I guess it's all related in the same field but, you know.  There's no pretense that this is one humongous paper, it's just [laughter] little papers put together [laughter].
4:02 4:06 MALE:  Right, cool.  So what did you major in when you were an undergrad?
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Economics.
4:07 4:08 MALE:  Economics.
4:08 4:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was good.  It got me a job after college, so.  I liked it.
4:13 4:16 MALE:  So you worked for a while after you, you worked for a while and then went back to law school?
4:16 4:37 FEMALE:  I worked for three years and then um, when I even in law school a couple of years.  So this is my [laughter] work experience is now, you know, the same length as my law school experience.  Yeah, now I'm embarking on a 40 year career that, you know stretches in front of me nonstop.  And so I'm kind of like, oh my god [laughter].  I should be really use this uh, time to, I guess enjoy myself.
4:38 4:42 MALE:  Yeah, definitely.  So when, when do you start, do you start like right after you graduate or in New York or?
4:42 4:46 FEMALE:  No, I start um, September 26th.  They already gave me my start date [laughter].
4:45 4:46 MALE:  Okay, okay.
4:47 4:49 FEMALE:  I kind of want to start earlier actually [laughter].  
4:49 4:50 MALE:  That's pretty bad when you [laughter].
4:51 5:13 FEMALE:  Well, yeah, it kind of is.  But like I have all summer, and I'm like, okay what am I going to do by myself this summer.  And one of the things I have to do is um, study for the bar exam.  So that's going to be a drag, but, um, that ends in like late July.  Then I'm going to, I'm going to go on a trip.  Um, I'm not going to go on a trip for like two months, so, I don't know [laughter].  It's nerdy to start working early, but, oh well [laughter].  At least they pay me [laughter].
5:14 5:17 MALE: Yeah, that'll be exciting, really exciting.
5:17 5:18 FEMALE:  Cool.
5:19 5:20 MALE:  So are we moving on?
5:21 5:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think so.
5:22 5:23 MALE:  Well, it was nice to meet you.
5:23 5:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, nice meeting you too.
