0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:01 0:02 MALE:  Just give me one more second.  
0:04 0:06 FEMALE:  Take your time, [unintelligible].
0:04 0:18 MALE:  You guys--I'm slow. Good.  
0:22 0:24 FEMALE:  You need some more.  male116, you need a Teddy Graham?
0:22 0:26 MALE:  Uh, I just had about six pieces of chocolate, so I'm going to slow down.  
0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  So you're good to go. I'll shut up so you can finish. 
0:28 0:36 MALE:  I'm almost done.  So what are those, the honey ones or?  
0:38 0:38 FEMALE: Uh-huh. 
0:37 0:38 MALE:  Those are the best ones.
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  Good flavor.  
0:38 0:45 MALE:  Yeah, they are.  Actually, that's the only ones I actually buy.  If they're on sale maybe I'll buy them, but the other ones I think are kind of--they're not nasty, but they're not as good.  
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  I like the red ones too.  
0:46 0:46 MALE:  I don't know what they are.  
0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  Cinnamon.  
0:47 0:51 MALE:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, they're okay.  The chocolate ones are just too much chocolate [unintelligible].  
0:54 0:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, chocolate is not good.  It's like I know all the flavors of snack food because like I taught second grade for three years.  
0:57 0:58 MALE:  Did you?
1:01 1:15 FEMALE:  So, I can like identify, you know, all the crap food that actually taste good as you walk around and make the kids show their snack.  [unintelligible] teddy graham flavors. You know sometimes you're just hungry, and you need to see what everybody, you know, brought for snack.  
1:14 1:16 MALE:  Did you teach for America or did you--
1:18 1:20 FEMALE: I got certified as an undergrad actually.  
1:18 1:19 MALE: Oh really?  Where did you teach?  
1:22 1:22 FEMALE: In Boston. 
1:21 1:23 MALE: Like in the city or in the suburbs?
1:25 1:27 FEMALE: In one of the western suburbs.  
1:25 1:26 MALE: Oh, okay, cool.  
1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Great job.  
1:27 1:31 MALE: What made you--are you at the ed school now?  
1:33 1:37 FEMALE: I am.  I'm doing a Master's in policy, organization, and [unintelligible]. 
1:35 1:39 MALE: Oh, okay.  So, what do you want to like teach long-term, or you don't know?  
1:41 1:50 FEMALE: No, I wouldn't be surprised if I go back to the classroom at some point, but for now I'm sort of ready to explore other ways of staying in education without being in a classroom.
1:48 1:48 MALE: Really.  
1:51 1:56 FEMALE: I'm looking at non-profit organization sort of doing school reform outside--
1:55 1:56 MALE: [interposing]  Really?  Okay.  
1:58 2:00 FEMALE: So, how about you?  What are you studying?  
1:59 2:08 MALE: I'm in political science.  So, actually I've done a little bit--I'm a democrat, but I've done a little bit of work with nameX who I know a lot of you guys like.  He's not popular in the ed school.  
2:10 2:14 FEMALE: Not so much, but you know, it's a pretty liberal [unintelligible] too.  
2:12 2:19 MALE: Is it?  I don't know.  I'm not interested in education policy.  I'm more interested in bureaucracy, which is where Terry made his name.  
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Right.  
2:19 2:27 MALE: In which he's done some really good work, and then he kind of got into education.  A lot of people think that work he kind of traded on his credibility from his bureaucratic work.  
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  
2:28 2:43 MALE:  So, I do some more ideologically driven stuff, but anyway--yeah, so I'm a first-year in poli sci, and I like American institutions, bureaucracy, but I'm still kind of figuring it out.  
2:45 2:46 FEMALE: You're PhD?
2:44 2:52 MALE: Yeah, there's no Master's.  Well, you know, people waste so much time in grad school, myself included.  So, I don't think you ever have time.  I really don't.  
2:55 2:57 FEMALE:  Well, our program is only nine months so we don't have time to [unintelligible].  
2:55 2:56 MALE:  That's true.  
2:58 3:22 FEMALE: We don't have puttering time.  We're like--I mean it's actually funny because I feel like I came not knowing what I wanted to do with myself over the last like six months when everybody would ask me.  I don't know.  I'm here to figure it out.  Really, you know, for a while I was like nine months is not long enough.  You know, most of us who are in this program had no idea what we wanted to do.  And most of us had no idea in [unintelligible] February.  All of the sudden people have sort of started to figure it out.  
3:20 3:23 MALE:  Do you think they really figure it out?  Or is it just like out of necessity?
3:26 3:28 FEMALE: No, I think people are really starting to figure it out.  
3:26 3:26 MALE: Really?  
3:28 3:32 FEMALE: I think what happened is that a lot of us came sort of not knowing what the options are.  
3:30 3:30 MALE: Right.  
3:33 3:40 FEMALE: Knowing that there are a lot of options in the vocation but not, you know, since we were coming from one particular part of the field and not knowing what else is out there.  
3:39 3:39 MALE:  Right.  
3:41 3:49 FEMALE: And we thought in a lot of the [unintelligible] and a lot of things, and I think what for me at least, and a couple other people I know, we sort of started eliminating the things we really don't want to do.  
3:47 3:47 MALE: Right.  
3:49 3:53 FEMALE:  And then you sort of realize--you graviate toward [unintelligible].  
3:51 3:52 MALE: That makes sense.  
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  There you are.  
3:54 3:56 MALE:  It's a hurry up offense.  Yeah, [unintelligible].  
3:58 4:00 FEMALE:  It is.  I mean it's not a long time to figure it out.  
3:59 4:09 MALE: No, I guess--I think it's a clich'e, but like figuring it out is probably like 90% of the battle.  Like, the tactics of getting there are like substantially easier than--
4:11 4:11 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
4:10 4:11 MALE: So--but I guess it's worth the [unintelligible].  
4:14 4:18 FEMALE:  You just have to be whatever.  You're trying to figure out what you want to do, you know, your next job.  
4:17 4:19 MALE: That's true, and we'll keep going to academia.  
4:22 4:23 FEMALE: It's not going to happen.  
4:21 4:21 MALE: Yeah. 
4:24 4:24 FEMALE: Take care.
