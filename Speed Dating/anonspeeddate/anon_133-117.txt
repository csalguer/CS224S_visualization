0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  Hi.  
0:02 0:07 MALE:  Hi, my name's nameX. I know.  Well, she--I talked.  
0:07 0:09 FEMALE:  That's what happens when you have to hurry up.  
0:11 0:19 MALE:  I know.  It actually--the problem is how they have everyone actually try to think and go, okay.  But she was saying they are worried these things are going to run out.  
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  How what?  
0:20 0:34 MALE:  They're worried these are going to run out, and that's why they're being so spastic about it.  So, the guys I think all have cases because I saw the girls.  And then I was going, oh, am I supposed to open this?  And then I saw the guys all [unintelligible]. 
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  Ah, okay.  
0:34 0:37 MALE:  So, female133, nice to meet you.  I'm male117.  So?  
0:36 0:37 FEMALE:  So, I study economics.  
0:40 0:40 MALE:  Economics.  
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:41 0:43 MALE:  Okay.  Are you getting a PhD?  
0:42 0:42 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:44 0:47 MALE: Okay.  So where did you go for undergrad?  
0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  I went to Indiana. 
0:48 0:52 MALE:  Indiana?  Okay, Illinois.  
0:51 0:53 FEMALE:  Really?  Three people I have talked to here.  
0:56 0:57 MALE:  Oh, really, they let you [unintelligible] we're still going.  
0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  My niece is all in engineering.  
1:00 1:12 MALE:  Oh, that's right.  No, I wasn't in engineering.  My dad thought I was going to go in there and [unintelligible].  I didn't, and then he thought I was going to go into business.  And I didn't do that either, and when I did liberal arts he was like, what [unintelligible].  
1:11 1:12 FEMALE:  So, what did you do?  
1:14 1:16 MALE:  I'm in law school now.  
1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
1:17 1:23 MALE:  But I went into education, and then I was teaching for a little while, and then I went back and decided to go to law school.  
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:25 1:29 MALE:  A little different, but actually I've been doing education stuff during law school.  
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Oh, really?  
1:29 1:30 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  So, what type of work?  
1:32 2:06 MALE:  I worked on a big lawsuit on behalf of four minority kids to make sure they were getting adequate educational resources, and then I've been working in the clinic at school just on individual cases--kids who, you know, have had a problem like one kid was kind of kicked out of school not for disciplinary reasons but for this really complicated--this program he was in and he got kicked out of it, and then you can't get back into it unless you're in kindergarten.  He'd been in it since kindergarten, and he was in high school.  They're like, sorry, we can't let you back in.  I was like, no, you need to let him back in.  So...
2:04 2:05 FEMALE:  Where did you teach?  
2:07 2:11 MALE:  I taught in Chicago public schools, and I also taught in Florida. 
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:12 2:18 MALE:  I moved down to Florida for a couple of years and just--my sister and her family moved down there.  So, I was like I'm going to [unintelligible].  
2:17 2:17 FEMALE:  My brother is in Florida.  
2:18 2:19 MALE:  Where in Florida?  
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  Melbourne.  
2:21 2:24 MALE:  Melbourne, okay.  I was in West Palm.  So, Melbourne is [unintelligible].  
2:22 2:28 FEMALE:  Looking forward to him not having [unintelligible].  
2:31 2:40 MALE:  That's great.  I love warm weather so I love this [unintelligible].  That's probably why I came out here because it was like I wanted to--so, you're from Indiana.  
2:38 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, but I was sitting in London [unintelligible] grad school [unintelligible], and kind of [unintelligible].  
2:49 2:53 MALE:  Yes.  So, how many years you going to be five years out here?  
2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  How long is it going to take me?  
2:54 2:54 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:53 2:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:56 2:56 MALE:  Hopefully.  
2:55 2:58 FEMALE:  Five if I'm lucky, yeah.  Most people probably take six.  
3:02 3:04 MALE: So, what are you working on?  
3:02 3:04 FEMALE:  I'm a second year so we have coursework.  
3:07 3:07 MALE:  Ah.  
3:06 3:11 FEMALE:  So, I am focusing on like industrial organization regulation kind of like [unintelligible].  
3:14 3:21 MALE:  Yeah.  Okay.  That's pretty interesting.  But you don't have to decide yet what you're really going to do for your research.  
3:20 3:22 FEMALE: This summer I need to get closer.  
3:24 3:26 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  Some people are [unintelligible] don't know what they want to write about.  
3:29 3:30 MALE:  Something like that.
3:28 3:29 FEMALE:  Six year.  
3:31 3:33 MALE:  You don't want to be them though, do you?  
3:31 3:34 FEMALE:  Oh, I mean it's like [unintelligible] who aren't on the [unintelligible] job market.  
3:37 3:42 MALE:  But wait--do all of them have like TA positions or something, or research assistants.  
3:40 3:45 FEMALE:  In theory it says that you have to obtain funding after five years.  
3:47 3:47 MALE:  Oh.  
3:46 3:49 FEMALE:  But in the end you could say I [unintelligible] so.
3:52 3:52 MALE:  Okay.  
3:51 3:54 FEMALE:  So, in the [unintelligible] it's usually fine.  
3:57 3:57 MALE:  Okay.  
3:58 4:04 FEMALE:  I'm not going to be one.  [laughter]
4:06 4:07 MALE:  Well, good talking you.  
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Good talking to you.  
4:08 4:09 MALE:  Okay, talk to you later.
