FILE NAME:  240-211

0:00 0:02 FEMALE:  I'm going to write your name down, so male211 [laughter].
0:01 0:04 MALE:  Sure, the station number is there for your tea?
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Tea.
0:05 0:08 MALE:  Tea, okay.  I think that's the...
0:08 0:11 FEMALE:  female240, female240.
0:12 0:13 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:13 0:16 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  Let me guess, engineer?
0:17 0:25 MALE:  Ah, yes, and no.  I'm in the business school right now.  But I was an engineer.  I still am an engineer, I still hold the degree.
0:26 0:28 FEMALE:  Oh, that's like a good point.  So are you getting a PhD or an MBA?
0:29 0:30 MALE:  PhD.
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  Do you know nameX?
0:32 0:33 MALE:  I don't know.
0:33 0:39 FEMALE:  [laughter] yeah, he'd be like the only person that I know [unintelligible].  But he's also getting a PhD, so I figured you guys might know each other.
0:38 0:45 MALE:  If he, he's uh, I meet him on and off like I really don't know him.  But is, is he finishing this...?
0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  I don't know
0:46 0:47 MALE:  Oh, you don't know.
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  I haven't talked to him in like a year, so [laughter].
0:48 0:50 MALE:  Oh, okay.  So I see him on and off.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Oh, cool, so.
0:52 0:53 MALE:  What about you?
0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.
0:54 0:55 MALE:  Law school, okay.
0:55 0:58 FEMALE:  I'm going to be an attorney, so, yeah [laughter].
0:58 1:04 MALE:  And you're still starting, well you're in the, are you in the master's or PhD, or?
1:05 1:25 FEMALE:  The law school's a little bit different.  Um, me, I'm in a program called the JD, which is basically what all lawyers have.  Um, but then there are programs for international students.  And so you can get an LM, which is kind of like a master's or a GSD which is like a PhD.  So there are actually two girls here also from the law school and one is getting an LM and the other is getting a GSD.
1:25 1:26 MALE:  So you, you're getting the GSD?
1:27 1:29 FEMALE:  No, I'm getting the JD, so.
1:29 1:31 MALE:  What, what is, which one was that?
1:31 1:42 FEMALE:  JD is just um, like I'd say like 99% of lawyers that practice have a JD.  So, it's not really equivalent to a master's or a PhD, it's just something else [laughter].
1:42 1:44 MALE:  It's something you have to do, sort of.
1:44 1:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:45 1:47 MALE:  And what's your specialty?
1:47 1:54 FEMALE:  I don't really have one actually.  I'm going to be a litigator, which is um, like the people on TV that you see.  Like, they argue and stuff.
1:54 1:55 MALE:  Oh, so criminal law.
1:56 2:01 FEMALE:  No, not criminal, it's probably mostly going to be civil, actually, but um, yeah.  There are different--
2:00 2:01 MALE:  [interposing] civil, you're going to--
2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  What?
2:02 2:26 MALE:  No, nothing just, that, I mean I've met like 10, 15 lawyers like not right now, but in general and none of them are litigators.  So like I keep asking them like, criminal law.  They say nowhere near that.  They're like intellectual property or immigration or what else, all that sort of corporate law and you know.  This time, this is the first time I didn't ask a lawyer, like, you know [laughter].
2:25 2:28 FEMALE:  I'm a litigator [laughter].  Yeah, no--
2:28 2:29 MALE:  It's like the Murphy's law, it's like [laughter].
2:30 2:38 FEMALE:  No, no, I mean, even as a litigator though, you'd only spend a very, very, very small fraction of your time, like getting up and arguing.  Most of it is [unintelligible] to get ready.  But like--
2:38 2:41 MALE:  [interposing] so people are not that argumentative in reality.
2:41 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
2:42 2:45 MALE:  You see our point, yeah that makes sense, whatever [laughter].
2:45 2:49 FEMALE:  Most of the time we're just sitting in our offices on the computer like, writing [unintelligible] [laughter].
2:50 2:54 MALE:  Yeah, people will, or computer work always gets everywhere, right?
2:54 2:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, I guess, so.  Cool, what year are you?
2:58 2:59 MALE:  Fourth year.
2:59 3:02 FEMALE:  Wow, are you going to be graduating soon?
3:02 3:07 MALE:  Hopefully if my advisor, you know, I need to get him drunk and he'll just sign that.
3:06 3:12 FEMALE:  [laughter] yeah, that's a good strategy [laughter].  Or just keep on bugging him, and it's like, he'll be like, okay fine, I'll just sign off on it.
3:09 3:17 MALE:  I'm working on it.  No, that, that won't help.  It would just annoy him and you know, he sees me twice a week for half an hour each time.
3:17 3:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:18 3:19 MALE:  You know, you can...
3:19 3:22 FEMALE:  Twice a week is a lot actually, um.
3:22 3:22 MALE:  Is it?
3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  I think so [laughter].
3:24 3:26 MALE:  Maybe I'm bugging him already [laughter].
3:26 3:30 FEMALE:  No, that's good, you know, the more you bug, the more likely he is going to sign.
3:30 3:33 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, he just went, just give me the damn thing, I'll sign it and sign you off.
3:32 3:33 FEMALE:  [laughter] I know.
3:34 3:35 MALE:  And just get off my...
3:35 3:37 FEMALE:  Just graduate, graduate, graduate [laughter].
3:38 3:49 MALE:  Yeah the other day I was walk, I was talking to my advisor, and this professor whom like I talked to like a year ago, looks at me, haven't you graduating yet?  I'm like [laughter] [unintelligible].
3:48 3:50 FEMALE:  Well that doesn't seem like a lot for a PhD at all.
3:51 4:02 MALE:  Not too really, actually.  That's the least it takes of PhD and, I mean in our school you're done in four to five which is the norm.  But like in computer science or something, it would be seven to eight years, so.
4:01 4:12 FEMALE:  Seven, yeah, no, my friend's in electrical engineering and he's like, oh my god, I'm here for seven years.  And I thought that like, maybe [unintelligible] and then he was like, oh yeah, everyone graduates [unintelligible], who cares.
4:12 4:14 MALE:  So you're program is like a year, two years?
4:14 4:14 FEMALE:  Three.
4:14 4:15 MALE:  Three?
4:15 4:15 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:15 4:17 MALE:  And this is your first, second year?
4:16 4:17 FEMALE:  Third [laughter].
4:17 4:19 MALE: Third year, oh, so you're almost done.
4:18 4:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.
4:21 4:22 MALE:  Good luck.
4:21 4:22 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
