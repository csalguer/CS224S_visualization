FILE NAME:  240-218 

0:00 0:03 MALE:  This really not a lot of talking left until the end.  Do you [unintelligible]?
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  I have no idea [laughter].
0:06 0:08 MALE:  I guess some things that have like an electrical charge, I guess.
0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  Oh, it'll shock you [laughter].
0:10 0:12 MALE:  Yeah, I hope not.  We were thinking of that earlier. I'm male218.
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  I'm female240, nice to meet you.
0:13 0:21 MALE:  female240, nice to meet you.  Um, female240, that's a very interesting name.  Where, what kind of a name is that?
0:21 0:28 FEMALE:  It's Chinese.  It's really funny, because like when I showed up to this speed dating thing, they were like, oh my god you're not a guy, because they had [unintelligible].
0:28 0:32 MALE:  They put you on, they put you on, like the wrong side of the divide?  That's a little bit embarrassing.
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:33 0:43 MALE:  I saw, I saw an nameX  and first I thought it was nameX [phonetic], like a Russian name and so I was a little bit confused by that too, oh.  It's nice because, like male218, there's never, there's never usually a problem with that.
0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  Is normally a guy, yeah.
0:43 0:51 MALE:  Although, I, I study Russian and whenever, whenever I got to Russia, the Russians like can never remember the name male218.  They always think I'm saying my name is nameX.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:52 0:56 MALE:  So, that's been particularly disasterous  these last four years because I always introduce myself as male218.
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:56 1:10 MALE:  Right away they think I'm nameX.  I tried to convince them it's actually male218, they, they get actually a little bit offended that.  And I'm like, like, we know the name nameX really well, nameX Bush, nameX Washington, and then I get called nameX for like the rest of my life with them, so.
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  Well, nameX is a good name.
1:11 1:16 MALE:  It's an okay name,  yeah, except like the whole like, you know that name, like nameX Bush, it gets a little bit awkward.
1:15 1:18 FEMALE:  [laughter] you're like, no, not W, not W [laughter].
1:17 1:25 MALE:  Right, right, right, the, well the thing is too is my last name's Walker.  And that W stands for Walker, so, in theory they're giving me, they're giving me that name.
1:24 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  So they, you basically are nameX's representative in Russia [laughter].
1:28 1:35 MALE:  Essentially, yeah, his representative in Moscow.  I don't even know your political or anything, but who knows.  So what is it that you study here?
1:35 1:37 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.
1:37 1:38 MALE:  Law school?  Amazing.
1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:39 1:40 MALE:  First or second year?
1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  Third.
1:41 1:42 MALE:  Third year.
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  [laughter]
1:42 1:43 MALE:  Is that sort of like, that's sort of getting towards...
1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  Graduate in two weeks, so.
1:46 1:51 MALE:  Wow.  Oh, that's right because you guys are on a, you guys are on a different semester.  You guys are on the semester as opposed to the quarter.
1:51 1:57 FEMALE:  We're on semesters.  And then our, our program just ends in three years.  So I have no dissertation, no nothing, so.
1:56 1:58 MALE:  Okay, no dissertation, no nothing.  They just sort of cut you lose?
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  [laughter].
1:59 2:00 MALE: Are you planning on practicing law in the area?
2:01 2:04 FEMALE:  Yep, oh, not here, um, but in New York, yeah.
2:04 2:06 MALE:  In New York?  Oh, like New York City?
2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  Uh-hum, Manhattan.
2:08 2:13 MALE:  Awesome.  I went to; I went to school in Connecticut.  I went to Wesley, a small liberal arts school.
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  Oh, no.
2:14 2:20 MALE:  And like everybody's in New York City that I know of.  Like um, like all of my friends are right now are either in Manhattan or in, or in Brooklyn.
2:21 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, no, I hear.  Yeah, most east coast people stay on the east coast, so [laughter].
2:25 2:33 MALE:  Yeah, I mean even like the Californians that went out to Wesley they ended up sort of being pulled to New York.  I thought a lot more people would end up out here, but I was one of the only ones.
2:33 2:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:34 2:35 MALE: So do you have, do you have family that lives back in New York?
2:36 2:38 FEMALE:  No, I'm actually from here, so.
2:38 2:39 MALE:  Oh, you're from California?
2:39 2:42 FEMALE:  Actually I'm from the Bay Area, like [laughter].
2:41 2:43 MALE:  From the Bay Area.  Where'd you go to under--
2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  Like 20 minutes away.
2:43 2:44 MALE:  Where did you go to undergrad?
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  Berkley.
2:44 2:46 MALE:  Okay awesome.
2:46 2:50 FEMALE:  So, I've never left the Bay Area, so I was like, no I got to go somewhere else.
2:49 2:57 MALE:  So cross, down low, yeah.  Well, Manhattan's a good start.  It's should be pretty, should be a pretty fun time.  Do you know any, do you know anybody out there are or is it just like?
2:57 3:03 FEMALE:  Well, I have like five friends from law school who um, are also going to be in Manhattan.  So I'm like, oh, that's rocks.  Um...
3:00 3:03 MALE:  Uh-huh, that's cool, and you can network.
3:04 3:07 FEMALE:  I guess [laughter], I'm not very good at that [laughter].
3:06 3:14 MALE:  That's really smart.  Really?  Yeah, I'm a third year too, um in Russian language and literature.  But we usually takes about seven years to get done with our program.
3:14 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, seven years, wow.
3:17 3:29 MALE:  Yeah, although on the plus side the, they encourage us to go abroad for a lot of time.  And so, it's not like I'd be in Escondido Village for the next four years.  So probably like sort of halfway between here, Colorado and Moscow.
3:29 3:33 FEMALE:  I think I would die if I had to be in EV for seven years.  I remember what it used to be like [laughter].
3:32 3:39 MALE:  Yeah, I think, I think like three years bouncing around.  I think that's, I think that's pretty good.  And then like finally they broke the uh, the graduate students center.
3:39 3:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:40 3:45 MALE:  But it like, it's way too late, because the, they keep promising to open Central Caf'e Bar, but...
3:45 3:46 FEMALE:  No alcohol [unintelligible].
3:46 3:48 MALE:  No alcohol, right.  Nothing has, nothing has really come of it yet.
3:49 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I don't know, I think it would be so much better if they'd, didn't have all that florescent lighting, but. I mean it basically looks like a conference center to me [laughter].
3:56 4:05 MALE:  Yeah, there's something about that too, like the, the, the dance floor that wooden panel floor like a.  Yeah, I can't get her, yeah; it looks like something that comes from like a swanky hotel that has like wooden floor.
4:06 4:12 FEMALE:  It's like, it's better to have like a really decrepit bar that like serves alcohol as opposed to--
4:12 4:17 MALE:  Yeah, maybe just like dig up a basement and just, something around there.  Well female240 it was really nice seeing you.
4:17 4:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, nice meeting you too.
4:18 4:19 MALE:  Uh-huh, take care.  Have a good rest of the night.
4:19 4:20 FEMALE: You too.
