0:39 0:40 FEMALE: [laughter] 

0:07 0:08 MALE: Okay.

0:41 0:43 FEMALE: It's a little stressful.  [laughter] 

0:12 0:14 MALE: How's this going for you so far?

0:46 0:48 FEMALE: All right.  Interesting.

0:16 0:18 MALE: I'm kind of-I'm really tired and so I'm like--

0:50 0:52 FEMALE: [laughter]  I'm female121, by the way.

0:20 0:20 MALE: male116.

0:53 0:54 FEMALE: Hi, nice to meet you. 

0:21 0:22 MALE: Good to meet you.

0:54 0:55 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

0:22 0:25 MALE: The obligatory question, what program are you in?

0:57 1:01 FEMALE: Um, I'm in the ed school in a masters program.  How about you?

0:29 0:30 MALE: I'm in political science.

1:02 1:05 FEMALE: Oh okay, in a masters or a doctoral program?

0:32 0:39 MALE: We don't have masters because it would be kind of worthless.  Like, not worthless but um, pretty much PhD or nothing, so--

1:11 1:11 FEMALE: Really?

0:39 0:40 MALE: Yeah.

1:13 1:16 FEMALE: Is there a masters option though if you stop early, if you don't--?

0:43 0:43 MALE: Yes.

1:16 1:17 FEMALE: Oh okay.  I was going to say.

0:44 0:46 MALE: It's like a terminal--yeah.

1:19 1:25 FEMALE: Right.  The were some--my friend went to Wisconsin and if you stopped early in history you didn't get a masters you just left with nothing.

0:54 0:55 MALE: That harsh, yeah.

1:27 1:31 FEMALE: It's really harsh.  So um, and what do you do for fun?

0:59 1:10 MALE: What do I do for fun?  Well, I've been doing a fair amount of like hiking club or climbing club.  I've been running a lot, um, and lame as it sounds I do political stuff.

1:43 1:47 FEMALE: [laughter] That's not lame.  It's good since you're studying it that that's what you're--

1:14 1:19 MALE: Well it's nice to--the gap between politics and like political science is like, growing. 

1:51 1:53 FEMALE: Uh huh, oh, uh huh.

1:21 1:22 MALE: How about you?

1:55 1:58 FEMALE: Um, I run.  I didn't know there was a hiking club here or I probably would have--

1:26 1:26 MALE: It's cool.  

1:59 2:02 FEMALE: Oh really?  How often--how often do--

1:29 1:34 MALE: They do a lot.  I mean, I can't, like I can probably go on like three or four things a quarter, and like still have time.

2:06 2:06 FEMALE: Oh really?

1:34 1:37 MALE: But they do something like almost every Saturday and every Sunday.

2:09 2:12 FEMALE: Oh really?  Is it web site?

1:38 1:39 MALE: Yeah. They're pretty active.

2:13 2:17 FEMALE: Oh, I'll go check it out.  Especially with it getting to be nicer out, I'm trying to take advantage of--

1:45 1:47 MALE: And the with the wild--wildflowers, like--

2:19 2:20 FEMALE: They're gorgeous.

1:47 1:49 MALE: Yeah, it's the best in like, a long time.

2:22 2:26 FEMALE: Yeah, I went down to um, Joshua Tree for Spring Break.

1:53 1:53 MALE: Oh did you?  

2:26 2:26 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:54 1:54 MALE: Awesome.

2:27 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah, just for like two days.  A friend of mine from New York flew out for a couple days and we drove down.  

1:59 2:00 MALE: Cool.

2:32 2:34 FEMALE: Yeah, and camped out.  It was really beautiful.

2:02 2:03 MALE: I want to go there.

2:35 2:38 FEMALE: It's beautiful.  Have you been to Joshua Tree before?  It's amazing.

2:06 2:07 MALE: I went to Death Valley.

2:40 2:40 FEMALE: Uh huh.

2:08 2:10 MALE: Which was really nice.  But--

2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Recently?

2:11 2:12 MALE: Like, the Spring Break.

2:45 2:48 FEMALE: Oh, because the flowers are supposed to be better there than Joshua Tree.

2:16 2:23 MALE: The flowers were good but like, I didn't-[unintelligible] I wouldn't go back just to see the flowers.

2:55 2:55 FEMALE: Uh huh.

2:23 2:24 MALE: Like, they weren't amazing.

2:56 2:57 FEMALE: Uh huh.

2:24 2:28 MALE: Like I think everything in the desert has to be like scaled to being in the desert.

3:01 3:05 FEMALE: Exactly.  It's the context of having flowers actually there that make it really cool.

2:32 2:34 MALE: But if you're spoiled like me, you're like oh.

3:06 3:08 FEMALE: [laughter] Right.

2:36 2:42 MALE: So, but still, I think it's a beautiful place, and it's great to be there in the spring.  The [unintelligible] is really hot, like, even in the spring it was hot.

3:13 3:23 FEMALE: Mm hmm.  I know, it's really warm in Joshua Tree too.  Yeah, the um, the flowers over like in Skyline Ridge and Russian Ridge, have you been over to those?

2:51 2:53 MALE: I've been to Russian Ridge, yeah.

3:25 3:27 FEMALE: Uh huh.  They're beautiful right now also.

2:54 2:59 MALE: I went about three weeks ago on like this--this weekend it will be three weeks.

3:31 3:31 FEMALE: Uh huh.

3:00 3:02 MALE: And they were good but I thought like I was a week too early maybe.

3:35 3:36 FEMALE: Oh, too early?

3:03 3:03 MALE: Maybe.

3:36 3:43 FEMALE: Uh huh.  My friend um, who's somewhere over there, and I are running a half marathon in Skyline Ridge on Saturday morning.

3:11 3:11 MALE: Oh really?

3:44 3:48 FEMALE: Yeah, so hopefully the flowers will keep me going.  [laughter] 

3:15 3:17 MALE: Are you going to do Bay to Breakers too?

3:49 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah, I think I probably will.  I'm going to be in the city the night before so I think I'll probably just crash at my friend's place and just do it.  Yeah.  Are you going to do it?  [horn]

3:26 3:27 MALE: I'm doing it, yeah.

3:59 4:00 FEMALE: Oh really?  It's supposed to be really fun.

3:28 3:30 MALE: I think-I'm not in great shape but like--

4:03 4:07 FEMALE: It's only-I think it's so crowded that you end up probably walking quite a bit of it anyway.

3:35 3:37 MALE: Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.

4:09 4:09 FEMALE: So--

3:37 3:39 MALE: Well maybe I'll see you in costume huh?

4:11 4:13 FEMALE: [laughter] Exactly.
