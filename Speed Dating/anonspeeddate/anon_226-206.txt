0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, it -
0:13 0:13 FEMALE2:  Like -
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  You don't get to move.
0:14 0:14 FEMALE2:  Yeah.
0:14 0:17 FEMALE:  I mean I like it that way better so -
0:17 0:18 FEMALE2:  [unintelligible].
0:17 0:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's better then the alternative but still I mean if they had both people move it would be -- probably be too complicated.
0:23 0:24 FEMALE2:  Very, very complicated.
0:25 0:28 FEMALE:  Here we go.  So what's the most controversial question you've asked so far tonight?
0:33 0:37 MALE:  Um, I asked someone if I was sincere.  I don't know if that's considered controversial [unintelligible].
0:38 0:38 FEMALE:  No.
0:38 0:43 MALE:  Um, most of my stuff -- that was the most controversial question from me.
0:44 0:44 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:44 0:45 MALE:  Yeah, I'm not really into controversial.  How 'bout you?
0:45 0:55 FEMALE:  I didn't ask any super controversial questions, a couple of guys ago who was asking -- he's asking apparently everybody who -- what their favorite sex position is, you know, so that was pretty controversial [laughter].
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Yeah,  I guess.
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:59 1:00 MALE:    So what have been the common results of that?
1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  I'm sorry?
1:01 1:05 MALE:  What have been the common results for that question?
1:05 1:10 FEMALE:  [laughter].  I don't know, here's the problem I actually know him from business school, so I was like I'm not giving you that answer. [laughter].
1:10 1:12 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  What school are you at?
1:14 1:15 MALE:  Stanford [unintelligible].
1:16 1:22 FEMALE:   No, I'm not, thank you. [laughter].  That's pretty funny.  
1:24 1:26 MALE:  I have [unintelligible] computer science.
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: [laughter].
1:27 1:27 MALE:    I'm sorry.  
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  You already said that,  that's alright.  
1:28 1:28 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:29 1:34 FEMALE:  So let me ask you this, did you find any dates -- potential dates?
1:35 1:35 MALE:  Um.
1:35 1:39 FEMALE:  How many -- how many yeses did you mark?
1:39 1:41 MALE:  I put down a lot of yeses.
1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  Oh, really?
1:41 1:42 MALE:  Yeah.
1:42 1:44 FEMALE:  See, so that's good, it's been fruitful, right?
1:44 1:49 MALE:  It's mainly out of curiosity of how many yeses I'm gonna get back, you know.  
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  Oh, that's interesting actually, that's a good point.
1:51 1:57 MALE:  I actually did this once before and I got like [unintelligible] diversity.
1:57 1:57 FEMALE:  Right, right. 
1:57 2:00 MALE:  [unintelligible] yeses.
2:00 2:04 FEMALE: Oh, that's awesome.  That's actually -- that's more [unintelligible] you, right, because -
2:04 2:04 MALE:  I have a question for you.
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  Sure.
2:05 2:12 MALE:  How many people for friendly do you put down like one or two or anything below like six?
2:12 2:18 FEMALE:  Almost none.  Anything below six I actually put down one person.  No, maybe two people below six.
2:18 2:18 MALE:  Really?
2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, how about yourself?
2:19 2:25 MALE:  Not really.  I think the variation in mind is like [unintelligible] it's really bad.
2:25 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:25 2:30 MALE:   Like, awkwardness, I'm not very good at judging awkwardness because -
2:31 2:32 FEMALE:   Oh, there's some people who are really awkward.
2:33 2:33 MALE:  I put down one and two [unintelligible].
2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  Oh, really? 
2:35 2:38 MALE:  I know some people who think I'm awkward, I'm just exhausted and tired.
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:38 2:40 MALE:  I don't feel awkward.
2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  [laughter].
2:41 2:45 MALE:  I'm sure I'm gonna get my share [unintelligible].
2:45 2:47 FEMALE:  It's better 'cause my initial one's -- my initial three -
2:47 2:48 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:48 2:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, my initial three I put down like for awkwardness a seven for myself. 
2:53 2:53 MALE:  Really?
2:53 3:02 FEMALE:    'Cause it felt, I mean, can you imagine of a more awkward setting, aside from like bright fluorescent lights, you know, you have a person right in front of you, that's pretty awkward, I mean -
3:02 3:02 MALE:  Yeah, that's true.
3:02 3:05 FEMALE:   I mean, that's enough to make yourself awkward.
3:06 3:06 MALE:  Do you feel awkward now?
3:06 3:11 FEMALE:  No, I'm fine now.  At this point, I'm just two tired, it's waning.  So -
3:12 3:18 MALE:  I didn't prepare myself properly for this event.  I was not very well rested.
3:19 3:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:19 3:26 MALE:  Even the first date [unintelligible] you know, you're too tired to feel awkward.
3:27 3:30 FEMALE:  Fair enough.  Do you think you'll do one of these things again or no?
3:31 3:34 MALE:  Um, hopefully not for a while.
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  [laughter].
3:34 3:53 MALE:  I don't know, they're kind of fun, but like I can think of actually some better ways to like get a bunch of strangers to actually be [unintelligible] like, like, like just have some event where you go and just like talk to people and you don't feel all this auxillary -
3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  Crap out, yeah.
3:54 3:56 MALE:  Stuff.
3:56 4:00 FEMALE:  Do you feel judged knowing that somebody else is going to fill it out?  No?
4:00 4:04 MALE:  No, I want to know what I did, I'm curious.
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  Awesome.  Oh, gosh.
4:06 4:09 MALE:  Like I wish that they gave you some results back, like.
4:10 4:10 FEMALE:  I don't know, will they?
4:10 4:10 MALE:  I don't know.
