0:06 0:07 MALE:  Hi, I'm male111.  
0:01 0:03 FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female133, hi.  
0:08 0:15 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  This is funny.  Which program are you in?  
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  Economics.  
0:17 0:18 MALE:  Oh, cool, which year are you in?  
0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  Second.  
0:19 0:20 MALE:  Oh, do you like it so far?  
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  I have mixed feelings about it.  
0:22 0:30 MALE:  Oh, what don't you like about it because I [unintelligible].  I'm in political sciences just right above you. So, I'm in your building all the time.  
0:25 0:32 FEMALE:  I guess it's just like the [unintelligible] requirements outside of the [unintelligible].  I probably would like it if [unintelligible].  
0:39 0:41 MALE:  Right, so is it kind of burning you down?  They wear you down.  
0:36 0:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think the--I don't know, especially in the first year I think they kind of try to [unintelligible].  
0:50 0:52 MALE:  Like [unintelligible] micro/macro--that kind of metric.  
0:47 0:56 FEMALE:  The metric [unintelligible].  I don't know.  I mean.  I think it's hard if you're an American coming in not as well prepared for [unintelligible].  
1:00 1:03 MALE:  Yeah, who had like math like all their lives or something like that.  
0:57 1:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, or at least [unintelligible] in my cohort like three-fourths of the people had [unintelligible]  already.  So, that's kind of new, and then some of us are [unintelligible].  
1:16 1:23 MALE:  Right, right.  Yeah, I tried to take 202 like in my last year or something.  I thought it was like--whoah, this is really hard.  So, that's fine.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  You're a political science major?  
1:24 1:26 MALE:  Yeah, I'm a third-year in the program, the PhD program.  
1:21 1:23 FEMALE:  A guy I went to college with is in third year.  
1:29 1:30 MALE:  In what?  
1:24 1:25 FEMALE:  Did you know I went to college with him.   
1:32 1:32 MALE:  Okay, who do you know?  
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  nameX.  
1:34 1:35 MALE:  You went to college with nameX.  
1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  I don't know him that well.  
1:36 1:43 MALE:  Okay, yeah, yeah, he and I were taking a lot of these classes together.  He had a really great place to watch TV.  So, you went to Indiana?  
1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  yeah.  
1:44 2:03 MALE:  Oh, cool, my parents just moved to Indianapolis, last year like--and I'm from Michigan.  So [unintelligible] is like now my home state, which is kind of weird. I went back there for Christmas, and I'm like--ah, Indiana.  It's like I don't really know anyone here, but, uh, [unintelligible].  Did you come straight from college here?  
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:04 2:08 MALE:  You said economics you dropped?  You said economics at IU then?  
2:03 2:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, I didn't think they [unintelligible].  I know the math and biology.  
2:12 2:16 MALE:  Yeah, and what made you decide to get a PhD in economics?  
2:11 2:18 FEMALE:  I think essentially--I don't know.  I really like biology and the scientific methodology, but I hate working in labs.  
2:25 2:25 MALE:  Okay.  
2:19 2:25 FEMALE:  I don't know, and also I kind of had difficulty committing to a major.  And that's not always a good thing if you're indecisive.  
2:32 2:32 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:32 2:36 FEMALE:  You can [unintelligible].  And I spent my senior year in London.  
2:37 2:41 MALE:  Oh, cool.  Were you at the [unintelligible]?  Or, okay.  Oh, wow, what did you think of London?  
2:35 2:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was nice.  I kind of wish I could have just been there half a year instead of a whole year though.  
2:45 2:54 MALE:  It's kind of expensive.  That's the only thing I remember when I traveled there.  Like when I was [unintelligible] and stuff like that.  Yeah, and also the weather was pretty--I remember the weather was awful when I was there.  
2:49 2:57 FEMALE:  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't that bad.  I thought it would be a lot colder than it was.  It was very mild.  [unintelligible] rained a whole lot.  It just always looked like it was about to rain.  
3:03 3:06 MALE:  Right.  So, should I go out?  
3:01 3:05 FEMALE:  Actually it was nice because I lived in the dorm right across the street from the [unintelligible].  
3:12 3:12 MALE:  Oh wow.  
3:06 3:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, so it was right on the--
3:13 3:17 MALE:  [interposing]  I went there like when I visited.  Yeah, it was beautiful.  It's right near the--is it right near the river or something like that?  
3:12 3:14 FEMALE:  Right, right, yeah.  So, every day I walked to class I walked along the river.  
3:21 3:21 MALE:  Oh, cool.  
3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  It was [unintelligible].  
3:23 3:29 MALE:  Right.  [unintelligible].  Do you know what you plan on doing with economics, or does it not really matter yet?  
3:23 3:25 FEMALE:  I think my main field is [unintelligible].  
3:31 3:45 MALE:  Oh, cool, cool.  I just like--you don't call it risk [unintelligible] like [unintelligible] but like I guess nameX [unintelligible] stuff on [unintelligible].  I don't know who their [unintelligible].  
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, those are more like security guys you're talking about.  
3:48 3:51 MALE: Okay.  [unintelligible].  
3:45 3:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, she does that.  
3:52 3:52 MALE:  Okay.  
3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  She might be leaving.  
3:56 3:56 MALE:  Oh, really?  
3:51 3:52 FEMALE:  Going to Harvard [unintelligible].  
3:58 4:02 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it sucks when that happens.  
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  I think that's the buzzer.  
4:03 4:07 MALE:  Yeah, I hope it gets better though.  It almost [unintelligible] right then?  
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  
4:08 4:08 MALE:  Okay.  
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  I have one quick question.  
4:09 4:11 MALE:  Do you know who we write for these like station numbers?  
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  I'm "M" so.
