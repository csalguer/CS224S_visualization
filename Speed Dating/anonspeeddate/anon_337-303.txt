0:09 0:09 MALE:  All right.  

0:11 0:11 FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female337.

0:12 0:12 MALE:  female337?

0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  Yup.

0:13 0:13 MALE:  male303.

0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  Hi, male303.

0:14 0:14 MALE:  What's going on?

0:14 0:17 FEMALE:  I'm just trying to enjoy the evening.

0:17 0:18 MALE:  And are you?

0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  I think so, yeah.  This is my--this is your first speed dating?

0:21 0:21 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.

0:21 0:25 FEMALE:  This is my first one too, so I'm just trying to enjoy the experience of it and meeting new people.

0:26 0:31 MALE:  Well, what were you hoping--what were you--what did you think it was going to be like--how is it--how does, you know, compare or...?

0:31 0:44 FEMALE:  'Cause I come here with like--I was just--no expectations, so there'll be no disappointment, so I figure out--'cause I heard about this last night.  I mean, like I'm a last minute substitute for some girl, so, you know, okay, sure I'll come just--I'll meet people and just have fun.  A few hours and nothing to lose so.

0:44 0:44 MALE:  Yeah.

0:45 0:49 FEMALE:  And I thin--so since my expectations are pretty low, I think good.

0:50 0:50 MALE:  [laughter].

0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  I mean, it's nice just meeting new people.

0:52 0:53 MALE:  So, where do you--what do you do here?

0:53 0:58 FEMALE:  I am in the department of development biology studying bacteria during these--

0:50 0:59 MALE:  Studying bacteria?

0:59 1:01 FEMALE:  Yup.  How about you?

1:01 1:02 MALE:  Do you like it?

1:02 1:06 FEMALE:  Well, I do, but not as much as I used to so.

1:06 1:06 MALE:  Why?

1:07 1:20 FEMALE:  I guess I don't really have the passion for doing research as much as I thought I would have so, I'm going--I'll be looking for a job soon.  So, I think eventually I will switch away from doing research probably.

1:20 1:22 MALE:  What do you like doing, what are your other passions?

1:23 1:42 FEMALE:  Um, I would like to use my skills--analytical skills, I'm organized, so I'm exploring maybe I can do either--I don't know marketing and research analyst or maybe [unintelligible].  Or--I don't mind doing research if it's something that I like because I'm looking to another job as doing bio terrorism.  That sounds fun so.

1:43 1:43 MALE:  Bio terrorism.

1:44 1:45 FEMALE:  I hope I can get a job, but I don't know.

1:45 1:50 MALE:  What was what movie with--I think like with a monkey like Dustin Hoffman they like quarantine the whole town. 

1:50 2:11 FEMALE:  Nothing--nothing that exciting.  I think the study of bacteria and see how--I think in that particular group they just want to see how you can detect--like earlier detection.  So that before this like [unintelligible] a huge effort [unintelligible] something they suspect say Anthrax and they can do like a really quick scan or a quick test and decide it is or it is not.  So, no--no monkeys I guess.  I don't know.

2:12 2:13 MALE:  All right.  Switching [unintelligible] just--

2:12 2:12 FEMALE:  I just--

2:12 2:13 MALE:  Switching [unintelligible] for a second.

2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  Sure.

2:14 2:15 MALE:  What kind of music do you like?

2:17 2:22 FEMALE:  I do like a kind of rock and jazz, big bands [unintelligible].

2:21 2:23 MALE:  Like what CDs are in your CD collection?

2:23 2:39 FEMALE:  Actually, I--well, I--I listen to [unintelligible] of my native thing, so I listen to [unintelligible] pop music from Hong Kong too, so you may not recognize it.  And usually when I'm not I will turn on the radio.  So whatever they play I'll listen to it, so I'm tuned into--I think I like the '80s too.

2:39 2:40 MALE:  '80s, huh?

2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:41 2:46 MALE:  Have you been in--have you seen, uh, have you gone up to the City and seen this band called Tainted Love [unintelligible]?  Tainted Love.

2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  No.

2:48 2:49 MALE:  'Cause they're like an '80s cover band, right.

2:49 2:50 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:50 2:53 MALE:  And all they do is they sing all of the '80 songs that you know.

2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  Oh.

2:54 2:55 MALE:  You know it's crazy.

2:55 3:01 FEMALE:  'Cause like there are like songs that I don't actually know the name of the song, but then when I hear it you know what exactly and you can hum along with it.

3:00 3:01 MALE:  [unintelligible] the words or--

3:01 3:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:01 3:03 MALE:  --you know, that you kind of--general tone or whatever.

3:03 3:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's fun.  So, do you like '80s?  I assume you do too.

3:06 3:11 MALE:  You know, I mean, I'm just like in my car or at home I'm not going to put in an '80s CD.  

3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  You won't.

3:12 3:15 MALE:  But if I was at a--when I was at this club and they were playing this song--

3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Um-hum.  Oh, yeah.

3:16 3:18 MALE:  Yeah.  I'm like that's a good song, you know.

3:18 3:21 FEMALE:  I think it's just got everybody high and it's like, oh, yeah I recognize that song.

3:21 3:21 MALE:  Yeah.

3:22 3:24 FEMALE:  There's probably some [unintelligible] aged group things too I guess.

3:24 3:25 MALE:  [unintelligible] that was good.

3:25 3:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, so like what music are you into?  Are you--are you a musician [unintelligible]?

3:28 3:31 MALE:  No, no.  I'm not--I'm not that talented.  [laughter].

3:31 3:34 FEMALE:  Well, just not--not into playing music that much.

3:34 3:38 MALE:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know, you know, I like--I love to dance to hip-hop music.

3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

3:39 3:46 MALE:  But, uh, I definitely like kind of, you know, your--your Dave Matthew's [unintelligible] crow, duster type [unintelligible].

3:46 3:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, particular sound.

3:47 3:55 MALE:  And I--I--a friend actually where I used to work would make fun of me.  She said it was male [unintelligible] music.  It was like white male [unintelligible] start singing with their hands

3:56 4:01 FEMALE:  Oh.  Okay.  Well, but they--they are enjoyable, I think.

4:01 4:02 MALE:  Yeah, it's good stuff.

4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  I didn't get to--which school are you in?

4:03 4:04 MALE:  I'm sorry?

4:04 4:05 FEMALE:  Are you like in the business school or...?

4:05 4:06 MALE:  Yeah, I'm in the business school.

4:06 4:10 FEMALE:  One of the friends [unintelligible] I see.  Well, nice meeting you, male303.

4:10 4:11 MALE:  You too.
