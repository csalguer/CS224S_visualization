0:00 0:01 MALE:  Hi.
0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female240.
0:02 0:03 MALE:  female240?
0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04 0:05 MALE:  I'm male204.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Good to meet you.
0:05 0:10 MALE:  I nearly made that uh, the cardinal faux pas of shaking hands with something in my hand.
0:10 0:14 FEMALE:  Oh, no, it's okay; it would have been faux pas if we shook hands with your left hand [laughter].
0:14 0:25 MALE:  [laughter] yeah, yep.  Well actually I worked with a uh, one of the guys in another company that I worked with uh, was missing his right hand.
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  Ah, so he shakes with his left.
0:27 0:37 MALE:  So you know, in a business meeting and stuff, you're always like, you extend your right hand and stuff, so.  It's always kind of awkward when, if you extend your right hand and he brings up the hook, what do you do with it, you know, so.
0:37 0:38 FEMALE: Does he really have a hook?
0:38 0:43 MALE:  Yeah, he's got one, a hook that's got like this contraption that, so he can like, you know, pinch with things and stuff.
0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  Gotcha, yeah.
0:43 0:47 MALE:  It's, it's kind of creepy actually, but.
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  Did you shake it?
0:48 1:15 MALE:  No, no, I shook with the left hand.  Because he did, he started.  He, he initiated, so.  He initiates with the left hand and you're like.  I mean, at first, your brain's like, danger Will Robinson, danger, like, this just doesn't work.  but you're like, I know this is going to happen, so, of course you're starting to reach forward with the right, the left hand and then, and mother manners, remember, yeah, Miss Manners is just, standing over your shoulder waggling her finger at you.  No, no, no, not with your left hand.
1:15 1:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, it would have been freaky to shake a hook, I think.
1:18 1:19 MALE:  Maybe I should start with that.
1:19 1:20 FEMALE:  [laughter].
1:21 1:26 MALE:  Going around to, I don't know I've only got three dates left, let's see if it works, just, just walk up and...
1:24 1:26 FEMALE:  Oh, that's right because your, you're 17.
1:27 1:29 MALE:  Yep, yep, so.  Anyway.
1:30 1:31 FEMALE:  How are you doing tonight?
1:31 1:32 MALE:  I'm having a lot of fun.
1:32 1:33 FEMALE:  Cool.
1:33 1:39 MALE:  It's, this is, this is fantastically unique [laughter].
1:38 1:40 FEMALE:  [laughter] have you done speed dating before?
1:40 1:42 MALE:  No, I've never done it before, have you?
1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  No.
1:42 1:43 MALE:  Good thing--
1:43 1:46 FEMALE:  Oh, wait, yes, yes, once I did, like two or three years ago.
1:46 1:48 MALE:  Was it as fun as this?  I'm assuming you're having fun.
1:48 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no.  I think that like the good thing about Stanford speed dating is that like, for like intelligent, you're like, okay, everyone's intelligent, not that I really ponder that, so [laughter].
1:58 2:08 MALE:  [laughter] well yes, we were talking about like how, how you get like some of these things, like rate the other person on how they are.  Ambitious?  It's like...
2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  There's no way to figure that out.
2:09 2:16 MALE:  I'm going to sit down and be like, yes, I'm going to be the next president of the United States.  Then you're going to be like, ah, 10 for ambition what do you...
2:13 2:18 FEMALE:  And give me your card.  Alright, really.
2:17 2:26 MALE:  On your sincerity or intelligence, like, you know, they're not sitting here like, oh well, let me just tell you about Mott's last theorem, let me teach or something like that.  You're like, wow.
2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  I know, I know.
2:28 2:38 MALE:  You know so there are certain assumptions I guess.  It's kind of interesting to meet the people that, that are doing this tonight.
2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, no I've...
2:39 2:42 MALE:  Because it's very unlike typical groups that [unintelligible].
2:42 2:45 FEMALE:  Oh, really, [laughter] what is the typical group?
2:46 2:51 MALE:  Well okay, well alright, so it's like, you have my perspective is colored.  I'm an engineer.
2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:52 3:00 MALE:  Did I already say that?  Did you know that?  Okay so that's [laughter].  I'm getting good, I'm trying to go longer and longer into the conversation before I actually start revealing things about myself.
3:00 3:02 FEMALE:  [laughter] that's a good strategy [laughter].
3:01 3:26 MALE:  [laughter] because then you always have something fresh to talk about.  So, the uh, the, so my experience that drives this, they all kind of lock themselves in their holes, you know.  They'll, they'll like stumbled out for sunlight occasionally and be like, oh, I'm going to socialize.  You know, find somebody and be like, hi, I'm going to socialize.  And although this is like formetic [phonetic] like that, um, because of that horn... [laughter]
3:24 3:26 FEMALE:  [laughter] yeah.
3:26 3:55 MALE:  The um, the thing is, is that, uh, everyone's here is like looking to meet people.  And it's not, you know, some people might not be looking for a date or might, they might really be looking for a date or whatever, but everyone's just having fun.  And there's no pressure because, you know, one, one thing goes horribly, it's, it's not like a first date where like you're all nervous and stuff.  Because if a date goes horribly, then whatever, you move on to the next one and the girl circles no and it's all good.  So...
3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  And you don't even remember the girl either [laughter].
3:57 3:59 MALE:  I didn't even give you a chance to talk, so.
3:58 3:59 FEMALE:  Oh, no, its okay, it's okay.
3:59 4:00 MALE:  My apologies.
4:00 4:02 FEMALE:  No, no worries.  Nice meeting you.
4:02 4:03 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
