3:01 3:01 MALE:  Which is probably bad. 

3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  It is, no I'm [unintelligible] I [unintelligible] that it's really bad because --

3:37 3:37 MALE:  Yeah so we go up to Tahoe and we -- for a few days, but we don't ski though.  We'll go to a lake and retreat, we give some talks, it's no big deal.  I used to get stressed out about it, but I think I got more stressed out at this thing than I would at the -- 

3:53 3:53 FEMALE:  Yeah I don't doubt it.  I'm like [unintelligible]. 

3:56 3:57 MALE:  So how about you, how far are you from completing your degree?
