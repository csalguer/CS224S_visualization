0:04 0:05 MALE:  Which one are you?  
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  I'm "O". 
0:06 0:12 MALE:  Oh, okay.  I managed to get this all messed up, and it's not very difficult or very complicated.  But--
0:09 0:14 FEMALE:  It was pretty easy for me just sitting here.  The girls got the easy side I think.  
0:17 0:18 MALE:  You have to write down our number, or?  
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  Just your name.  
0:19 0:25 MALE:  Oh, okay. Got you.  So, how's this night going?  
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Okay.  It's exhausting.  
0:26 0:26 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  I'm working hard. 
0:28 0:34 MALE:  It's hard work.  It's hard work as the president would say, you know. So, what do you do?  
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Education, doctoral program.  
0:37 0:41 MALE:  Oh, okay.  With all you guys here tonight because I guess they can rope you in pretty easily right?  
0:38 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  My office is just upstairs.  It's like, okay.  
0:45 0:46 MALE:  And it's only a couple of hours, so.  
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:47 0:48 MALE:  So. 
0:45 0:45 FEMALE:  What program are you in?  
0:48 0:48 MALE:  Political science.  
0:46 0:51 FEMALE:  Oh, really?    I did poli sci in Wisconsin the doctoral program for a couple years.  
0:55 0:55 MALE:  Oh really.  
0:52 0:55 FEMALE:  And then just got way more interested in higher education.  
0:59 0:59 MALE:  Wo did you work with?
0:57 0:58 FEMALE:  nameX [unintelligible] and Paula Franklin.  
1:02 1:02 MALE:  I don't know much--
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  [interposing]  And [unintelligible].  
1:04 1:05 MALE:  What's that?  
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  On [unintelligible] and methods.  
1:06 1:19 MALE:  Oh, okay, methods, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in American politics.  We do--I'm not like methods is not like my core focus, but I think it's really important, and so I'm trying to get as much of it as I can.  
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  Who do you work with?  
1:20 1:29 MALE: Well, it's only my first year so we're figuring it out, but I mean, you know, a lot of faculty are hard to work with in the sense that they've been around a long time.  
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:32 1:39 MALE:  Like I think the best faculty to work with are like people who are about 45, or maybe 40 and just pretty recently tenured.  So--
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  [interposing]  And not stressed.  
1:41 1:45 MALE:  But they also still want to like spread their legacy and work with people. 
1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:46 1:48 MALE:  And so I don't know.  I'd like to work with Barry Winegast.  
1:46 1:46 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:50 1:55 MALE:  We'll see.  I'd like to work with Teri Mill also although I know people in the ed school hate him.  
1:52 1:55 FEMALE:  No, no, no, not everyone.  
1:58 1:59 MALE:  Most, yeah, a lot of people.  
1:57 1:57 FEMALE:  Other people.  
2:02 2:03 MALE:  Yeah, he's polarizing.  
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:05 2:12 MALE:  I'm not interested in education.  I'm more interested in bureaucracy, which I'm not saying--he's done a lot of good work.  
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:13 2:16 MALE:  So, what made you want to get into education from poli sci?  
2:13 2:30 FEMALE:  Well, I was--I got really involved in the [unintelligible], training, and so then I started doing like teaming up with researchers on undergraduate learning.  And so like I really just got into like research on college teaching.  And I don't know I just found a lot more passion about that than European integration.  
2:34 2:36 MALE: That's great though.  You probably joined the [unintelligible] list.  
2:33 2:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, but my advisor like nameX moved to Florence and then left like the university.  So, you know, I was just kind of like looking around and like--I want [unintelligible].  
2:48 2:59 MALE:  No, I mean I think the biggest mistake people make is like not following that impulse.  You can talk yourself out of it like [unintelligible] well, you know, I've invested a lot, blah, blah, blah.  But like you did it, so that's good.  
2:56 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was a risk, but you know the other thing is like I'm starting here with a lot of skills [unintelligible].  So.  
3:07 3:13 MALE:  I feel like people who come right from undergrad and don't have anything else they waste a lot of time.  I mean I waste time.  Don't get me wrong.  
3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  Like everyone.  
3:16 3:20 MALE:  I think you can get through it a little faster, but I don't know.  
3:17 3:20 FEMALE:  What did you--did you just do something between undergrad?  
3:23 3:28 MALE:  I did some work.  I worked for a little bit, and that's not to say I'm like super mature [unintelligible].  
3:26 3:26 FEMALE:  No.  
3:29 3:37 MALE:  But like it's like--I think I appreciate being in school a little bit because school sucks in a lot of ways, but there are nice things.  
3:34 3:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, like not having to be at work every day.  
3:41 3:47 MALE:  Exactly, exactly.  Excuse me.  I'm exhausted.  [unintelligible] is asleep.  
3:45 3:46 FEMALE:  I had a really nice time meeting you.  
3:50 3:53 MALE:  Likewise.  Now we've got to do another survey?  
3:50 3:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.
