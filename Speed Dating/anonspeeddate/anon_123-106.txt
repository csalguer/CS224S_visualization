0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:06 0:06 MALE:  Hi.
0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  female123.
0:07 0:07 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:08 0:09 MALE:  Nice to meet you, too.
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  So--
0:10 0:11 MALE:  Are you having a good time at this?
0:09 0:10 FEMALE:  How many more do we have left?
0:14 0:15 MALE:  We have--
0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  Oh you know what?
0:17 0:22 MALE:  One or two more left.  Two more left, I think.  I'm not completely sure.
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Oh right.  That's [unintelligible].
0:23 0:31 MALE:  I see a different person from where I started, I think.  So maybe I'm not or I almost heard--maybe they have like a whole nother room left or something.
0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  God, don't say that [laughter].
0:33 0:34 MALE:  Are you getting tired?
0:30 0:33 FEMALE:  No, I'm not getting tired.  But I'm ready to, uh, go get a drink after this.
0:37 0:38 MALE:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.  How's it been going for you?
0:40 0:46 MALE:  It's going all right.  I met a lot of people.  The conversations are kind of repetitive, I guess.
0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  The conversations are what?
0:47 0:52 MALE:  Kind of I'm saying the same thing each time.  Maybe that's what I'm supposed to do.  But, like--
0:48 0:50 FEMALE:  I feel like it's got to happen that way, because--
0:54 0:54 MALE:  Yeah.
0:51 0:54 FEMALE:  If you don't--if you haven't met someone, I mean, they're always, no matter what, the same sorts of questions--
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Yeah.
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  --that come up, like where are you from?  What do you do?
1:01 1:01 MALE:  Yeah.
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  You know--
1:02 1:02 MALE:  That's really--did you get that?
0:59 1:01 FEMALE:  I would be happy to talk about what ever you--
1:05 1:05 MALE:  Okay.
1:01 1:02 FEMALE:  --want to talk about.  What do you want--
1:06 1:06 MALE:  All right.
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  --to talk about?  
1:07 1:10 MALE:  Well where do you like to go out to get drinks around here?
1:07 1:10 FEMALE:  Oh okay.  I--this is actually a really favorite topic of mine.  
1:14 1:15 MALE:  Okay, good.
1:11 1:15 FEMALE:  If I'm kind of in a grungy mood, I love going to Antonio's Nuthouse Dish.
1:18 1:18 MALE:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
1:15 1:19 FEMALE:  They have $1 margaritas during lunch hour.  Have you--do you know that?
1:23 1:23 MALE:  No, I did not know that.
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, $1--
1:24 1:26 MALE:  You go there during lunch hour, huh [laughter]?
1:23 1:26 FEMALE:  Basically, I'm a law student, and the law students drink like nobody's business.
1:30 1:31 MALE:  Oh really?  Okay.
1:27 1:32 FEMALE:  If I'm going for like a cocktail, with my friends, I really like Noah's.
1:37 1:38 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah.
1:34 1:37 FEMALE:  If I'm going for a night out dancing, then I like [unintelligible].
1:42 1:42 MALE:  Okay.
1:39 1:40 FEMALE:  How about you?  Where do you--
1:44 1:45 MALE:  They have dancing at [unintelligible] every night?
1:42 1:44 FEMALE:  Um, it's on the weekends, Thursday through Saturday.
1:48 1:49 MALE:  All right.
1:45 1:45 FEMALE:  How about yourself?
1:50 2:03 MALE:  I guess the Nuthouse.  I don't have it broken down into scenarios [laughter] as well.  I'm sorry.  I like the Nuthouse, Blue Top, you know, those would probably be the main ones, I would say, as well.
2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean--
2:05 2:07 MALE:  I've been to the BBC a few times but--
2:04 2:05 FEMALE:  Oh BBC sucks.
2:10 2:14 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] when they have their hip hop dance night.
2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  Oh they do on Wednesday night?
2:16 2:16 MALE:  Yeah.
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  Thursday night is karaoke, no?
2:18 2:20 MALE:  I don't know.  I haven't been any other one.
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:21 2:23 MALE:  I think it's completely [unintelligible] place [unintelligible].
2:20 2:22 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] what's it like on Wednesday nights at the BBC?
2:27 2:39 MALE:  Um, I went--I think once I went on a senior night [laughter] so--be quiet [laughter].   I was going out with a senior.  It wasn't like I was scoping out senior night.
2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  That's so not even legal.
2:42 2:45 MALE:  Senior girls, that's legal.  How old do you think seniors are?
2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Barely legal.
2:46 2:49 MALE:  They're like, at least 21, at the youngest.
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Right.  That's true.
2:50 2:51 MALE:  That's legal by far.
2:48 2:51 FEMALE:  I guess.  I should have said they're barely legal.
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Yeah.
2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  Was it fun?
2:58 3:00 MALE:  Yeah.  It was fun.
2:58 2:58 FEMALE:  I must--
3:03 3:13 MALE:  And it's different while you're there with your girlfriend [unintelligible] otherwise if you were there.  It wasn't all undergrads.  There were like some older guys there.
3:09 3:10 FEMALE:  Of course there were older guys there.  
3:15 3:15 MALE:  Yeah.  Like me [laughter].
3:11 3:11 FEMALE:  I'm not surprised [laughter].
3:18 3:29 MALE:  And I guess the other time I went, which also looked like a lot of undergrads, like that type age people, it seems like maybe some of the younger grad students as well.
3:25 3:31 FEMALE:  That makes sense.  Yeah.  I have to admit, I went to Noah's once when they had senior night, and I felt so old.
3:35 3:35 MALE:  Yeah.
3:32 3:36 FEMALE:  So old.  I mean, they just looked so young to me, don't they?
3:41 3:41 MALE:  Yeah.
3:37 3:46 FEMALE:  I just--it was embarrassing.  I'm like, okay, we need leave.  We just went and left [unintelligible].  I cannot be here anymore.  I mean, these kids are like full of energy--
3:50 3:50 MALE:  Yeah.
3:46 3:49 FEMALE:  --and vitality and optimism.  And I'm just like an old crow.
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.
3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  I mean, what's going on?
3:53 3:58 MALE:  Yeah, especially here.  They're all so like optimistic at Stanford, I feel like.
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  Oh you think?
4:00 4:00 MALE:  Yeah.  I think so.
3:57 3:59 FEMALE:  As they're talking to you about something other than--
4:03 4:03 MALE:  Yeah.
3:59 4:03 FEMALE:  --you know, I don't even know where you are, and that's great.  It was nice meeting you.
4:07 4:07 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
