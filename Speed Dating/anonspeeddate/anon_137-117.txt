3:01 3:04 MALE:  [unintelligible] another law firm.

3:05 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No, that's great.  I was--actually I loved in Boston before coming out here and I was just there this past weekend and it's strange because it's so beautiful out here and it's so wonderful and yet I miss like--

3:16 3:16 MALE:  Yeah.

3:18 3:22 FEMALE:  --you know within the five days that I was there it went from being like 40 degrees to being 75 degrees.

3:21 3:22 MALE:  Yeah.

3:32 3:38 MALE:  And it's so hard travel [unintelligible] you really--you lose a whole day basically to travel.

3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:39 3:39 MALE:  And then--

3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

3:39 3:41 MALE:  --it [unintelligible] makes it really [unintelligible]

3:48 3:49 MALE:  Yeah, you can do that.

3:50 3:57 FEMALE:  If you do the red eye because then you do--don't lose the day when you go out and when you come back, if you leave early enough in the morning, then you don't lose much of the day--

3:57 3:57 MALE:  That's true.

3:59 4:05 FEMALE:  So I've traveled enough that I kind of have figured out because I--I love being different places but I hate traveling.

4:05 4:05 MALE:  Yeah.

4:06 4:08 FEMALE:  It's the sitting still thing.

4:07 4:07 MALE:  Yeah.

4:09 4:14 FEMALE:  And so I kind of figured out how to like minimize the stress of travel.  [laughter]

4:13 4:13 MALE:  Yeah.

4:14 4:17 FEMALE:  So--I don't know if I've mastered it yet but [laughter].
