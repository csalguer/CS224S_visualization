0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  So--

0:06 0:07 MALE:  So, what do you study here?

0:08 0:12 FEMALE:  I study, um, bacteria in the department of developmental biology.

0:12 0:12 MALE:  Really?

0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  Yup.

0:13 0:17 MALE:  Developmental--so you're hoping to [unintelligible] bacteria will develop into something else or...?

0:17 0:20 FEMALE:  No, actually just by--by chance my boss is in that department.  

0:20 0:20 MALE:  Oh.

0:21 0:23 FEMALE:  Actually, I think it's more microbiology because my degree is in microbiology.

0:23 0:24 MALE:  Oh, okay.

0:24 0:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:25 0:25 MALE:  Wow.  Is this a Ph.D. program?

0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  I'm done.  I'm post doc right now.

0:28 0:28 MALE:  Oh, wow.

0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:29 0:32 MALE:  So, you're like--now you can like do all the--publish all the
papers and [unintelligible] and--

0:33 0:38 FEMALE:  Oh, well, maybe not that part, but I hope to publish a paper and then find a job.  Find a real job.

0:38 0:38 MALE:  Oh, oh, 'cause, yeah.

0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:39 0:41 MALE:  Well, this is a great area to find a job in, isn't it?

0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  I hope so.  That's what I'm hoping too.

0:42 0:44 MALE:  There's lots of like biotech and--

0:45 0:49 FEMALE:  We have the most concentrated area in the country, so I'm counting my luck on that.  

0:50 0:50 MALE:  Yeah.

0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  'Cause I want to stay in the Bay Area that's why I'm trying to look for a job in the Bay Area.

0:52 0:54 MALE:  Oh, really.  Where did you, uh, grow up?

0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  I grew up in Hong Kong.

0:55 0:55 MALE:  Oh, okay.

0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm originally from Hong Kong.

0:56 0:58 MALE:  Totally different.  And--and I've never been to Hong Kong.

0:58 1:02 FEMALE:  Uh, yeah, I would say, but--'cause I went to the Midwest first.

1:03 1:03 MALE:  Okay.

1:04 1:06 FEMALE:  So, I think California is not as different as--

1:07 1:08 MALE:  It just has better weather.

1:08 1:12 FEMALE:  Better weather and they're--as you can picture [unintelligible] so much more Asians here.

1:12 1:13 MALE:  Yeah, no, no, no.

1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  A lot of Chinese restaurants and Asian restaurants.

1:14 1:15 MALE:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:15 1:20 FEMALE:  The only thing different is [unintelligible] it's huge difference between here and Hong Kong and between here and the Midwest--I mean, Hong Kong and Midwest.

1:20 1:21 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:22 1:23 MALE:  No, no, I can imagine, you know.

1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  But--so what--are you from California [unintelligible]?

1:24 1:26 MALE:  Yeah, actually I was born in Mountain View, so--

1:26 1:27 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.

1:27 1:28 MALE:  --so very close by.

1:28 1:28 FEMALE:  I see.

1:29 1:29 MALE:  I never left.

1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  I see.  Oh, wow.

1:30 1:31 MALE:  I'm a sucker for good weather.

1:32 1:35 FEMALE:  I just can't see any other place that's better than California.

1:35 1:37 MALE:  I know.  Actually, my brother lives in Thailand. 

1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  Thailand.

1:38 1:41 MALE:  And he--yeah and he wants me to go there and it's like it costs nothing to live here.

1:42 1:45 FEMALE:  That's what I heard too.  They say you can be a king with literally no money.

1:45 1:56 MALE:  I know.  He's like--he's like, you--you--he talks like he's wealthy.  It's like I have five people who serve me.  No, he's not that bad.  But, uh, but uh, no, he--he has a really good time there and--

1:56 1:58 FEMALE:  That's good.  So, temporary or like permanent?

1:58 2:01 MALE:  I don't know.  He was--he was going to be there for just two years, but--

2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Now--

2:02 2:03 MALE:  --every time I talk to him he's like--

2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  I don't want to leave.

2:04 2:10 MALE:  I can't, you know, people in the US who complain about everything and here they don't complain about anything.  They're just happy that you're around and--

2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  Oh, that's good.

2:11 2:12 MALE:  --nicer and so that's sort of cool.

2:12 2:17 FEMALE:  I see.  So, are you like [unintelligible] like are you in the school of business too?

2:17 2:19 MALE:  Oh, I, um, I did my MBA.

2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

2:20 2:22 MALE:  And now I'm doing my masters in electrical engineering.

2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Oh, I see.

2:24 2:25 MALE:  So, I'm a gluten for punishment.  

2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  [laughter].

2:26 2:30 MALE:  So, going through a program like you did is plenty of punishment I can probably [unintelligible].

2:30 2:32 FEMALE:  How interesting.  So, you go for your MBA first and then electrical engineering?

2:32 2:33 MALE:  Yeah, totally backwards from most people.

2:33 2:36 FEMALE:  Yeah--yeah, a lot of people would do the technical and then they say, oh, I need the business background.

2:37 2:40 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So, no I was always interested in engineering.

2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  I see.

2:41 2:42 MALE:  And my under grad [unintelligible] and engineering.

2:42 2:44 FEMALE:  You said--well, [unintelligible] what was not [unintelligible].

2:45 2:45 MALE:  What was not--was not.

2:45 2:46 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

2:46 2:50 MALE:  So, um, I was like, you know, I may as well do it.  I have an interest in it anyway--

2:51 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:51 2:53 MALE:  --you know, I work at [unintelligible] part-time too.

2:53 2:54 FEMALE:  I see.

2:54 2:58 MALE:  And so, you know, and Stanford agrees with me it's very expensive so.

2:58 3:01 FEMALE:  This is true.  Oh, so you pick it from scratch like engineering, no background at all?

3:01 3:02 MALE:  Totally [unintelligible] from scratch.

3:03 3:03 FEMALE:  Is it hard?

3:03 3:15 MALE:  Yeah.  It's insane.  Since I'm usually like the guy who asks all the dumb questions like can you tell me how to do that foray [phonetic] transfer form?  Like can you just spell foray form?

3:15 3:21 FEMALE:  The first time I heard it I was like what is that.  Yeah, I heard from like a [unintelligible] like what is foray [phonetic], blah, blah.  It's like who the heck is that.

3:21 3:23 MALE:  Yeah.  It's like some great, smart guy.  Smarter than me.

3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  Well, but it's--as you said like if you want to do it you may as well do it now.

3:28 3:33 MALE:  Yeah.  And so, you know, that's why I figure is that, you know, if you're interested in something and you have such great opportunities.

3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  That is so true.

3:34 3:38 MALE:  It is so rare to get like, you know, you get such an opportunity to learn something.

3:38 3:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:39 3:42 MALE:  I mean, you know, how many people in would kill to--to study that here.

3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  That is true.

3:43 3:49 MALE:  And so, you know, I can, you know, afford it so and I'm working part-time so.

3:50 3:51 FEMALE:  So, how many years would that take?

3:52 3:54 MALE:  Yeah, I'll probably be done in about--I think about a year and a half.

3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  That's not that bad.

3:55 3:56 MALE:  So, it's not bad at all so.

3:57 3:57 FEMALE:  No.

3:57 4:03 MALE:  So, it's a little stressful at times because you're like I don't understand a word they're saying.

4:03 4:05 FEMALE:  I know four minutes [unintelligible].

4:05 4:08 MALE:  Those things go so fast.  Boom.  Nice meeting you.

4:07 4:08 FEMALE:  Well, nice meeting you too.
