0:08 0:08 FEMALE: [laughter] and go, quick.
0:08 0:09 MALE:	[laughter] I know.
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:	I'm female229.
0:10 0:11 MALE:  I'm male204, nice to meet you.
0:12 0:15 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you, male204.  Okay, so do you got the whole you know, elevator pitch down yet?
0:17 0:18 MALE:  Elevator pitch.  [laughter].  
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:26 0:27 MALE:  Oh, the old elevator tricks.  [unintelligible].
0:28 0:29 FEMALE:  Well, hey, I guess they'll pile up.
0:30 0:31 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  So tell me a little bit about yourself.
0:32 0:51 MALE:  Um, oh, wow, that's open ended.  Um, let's see here, uh, I'm a Capricorn, I like moonlit walks on the beach and Mr. Right is 6 feet tall, dark and handsome.  So -- no actually I'm an engineer.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Okay, good.
0:52 0:56 MALE:  Um, I uh, worked for the last five years in the Navy.
0:56 0:58 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
0:58 1:10 MALE:  As an engineer.  I went to undergrad at Cornell, grew up on the east coast in D.C. and in my free time I cycle and I would like to play hockey but don't, because I don't have time.
1:11 1:16 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Well, that's good, do you um, bike a lot around here, like there's tons of trails -
1:16 1:17 MALE:  Yeah, kind of -
1:17 1:17 FEMALE:  Good stuff.
1:18 1:22 MALE:  No, not mountain biking, road biking.  So I like -
1:23 1:36 FEMALE:  Clearly not cognizant of any [unintelligible] bike for transportation [unintelligible].  Seriously, so myself, grew up in the bay area.
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Oh.
1:37 1:39 FEMALE:  Lived in New York City for about eight years, I went to N.Y.U.
1:39 1:40 MALE:  Okay.
1:40 1:42 FEMALE:  And um moved back here.
1:42 1:43 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:43 1:44 FEMALE:  I'm sorry?
1:44 1:45 MALE:  Are you a business major?
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  No, actually I'm in learning, design, technology.
1:47 1:49 MALE:  Four people that way.
1:48 1:49 FEMALE:  Really?
1:49 1:51 MALE:  All four girls, just straight back are business majors.
1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  You're kidding me?
1:52 1:54 MALE:  So I was thinking I was only meeting business majors tonight.
1:54 2:01 FEMALE:  No, you're in luck.  School of Education, there's a lot of us here tonight as well, so it will probably the rest [unintelligible] that you meet.
2:01 2:01 MALE:  That's right.
2:02 2:07 FEMALE:  And um, yeah, so I used to work in software development, so.
2:07 2:08 MALE:  Software development.
2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, management.
2:09 2:10 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:11 2:11 MALE:  Cool.  
2:11 2:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, pretty good.
2:12 2:12 MALE:  So are you -
2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  Bring it all together.
2:13 2:17 MALE:  Are you getting a degree to teach or -- or is it like a high degree or?
2:16 2:21 FEMALE:  Actually no, yeah, it's just a one-year masters program and when I leave, who knows.
2:21 2:21 MALE:  All right.
2:21 2:26 FEMALE:  That's the big question on the table right now, considering I graduate in June, the clocks ticking.
2:26 2:26 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:27 2:42 FEMALE:  Exactly.  And um, so, yeah, it's a really good question what I'll do next.  I'm looking at some different opportunities of like different companies, boring, boring, boring.
2:42 2:43 MALE:  Yeah.
2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  But yeah, I don't know, we don't get a credential, so.
2:46 2:48 MALE:  Right.
2:47 2:51 FEMALE:  I could teach, but it would be a little bit private school or something.
2:55 3:01 MALE:  I actually don't know how it's done in California, what the correct [unintelligible] I know a masters degree is required to teach, right?
3:01 3:05 FEMALE:  Not necessarily, not in um, not in elementary school I don't think.
3:05 3:06 MALE:  Oh.
3:08 3:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, there's a different -
3:07 3:08 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:08 3:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, they have like -- you do have to get a credential though and that's some kind of requirement.  I'm actually not too familiar with it.
3:14 3:15 MALE:  Okay.
3:15 3:26 FEMALE:  But um, yeah, and that -- I think that requires a little extra school since you're teaching that kind of thing.  Not exactly up my alley.  I love kids, but I'm more comfortable in a business setting, let's put it that way.
3:27 3:28 MALE:  [laughter].
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  I like to be the boss of other adults.  [laughter].
3:32 3:34 MALE:  Rather then sculpting America's future [unintelligible].
3:36 3:41 FEMALE:  I'd rather do that through my work.  Maybe not directly [unintelligible].
3:41 3:42 MALE:  Yeah, that's it.
3:41 3:49 FEMALE:  Maybe not directly responsible for one's childhood trauma.  It's probably better.  Probably better.
3:49 3:54 MALE:  We can all think back in your head what [unintelligible] most traumatic elementary experience.
3:54 3:58 FEMALE:  Exactly, I don't want it to be all Ms. female229's fault in therapy ten years later.  [laughter].
3:58 3:59 MALE:  [laughter].
4:02 4:05 FEMALE:   I know, it's amazing.  Well, male204 -
4:05 4:06 MALE:  All right, it was nice to meet you.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  It was very nice to meet you.
4:07 4:08 MALE:  Enjoy the rest of your dates.
4:08 4:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, thanks.
4:09 4:10 MALE:  And I'll fill out over here.
4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  All right.
