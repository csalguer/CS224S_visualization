0:18 0:18 MALE: Anyway. I'm male313.
0:19 0:19 FEMALE: I'm female325.
0:20 0:21 MALE: How's it going?
0:22 0:24 FEMALE: It's going pretty well. It's a lot of people to meet. It's pretty cool.
0:25 0:34 MALE: Yeah. I don't know, it's good though. Because the worst case is it's four minutes. There might be some weirdos but what could happen in four minutes.
0:33 0:33 FEMALE: So what do you do? Your studies?
0:35 0:35 MALE: CS, PhD.
0:37 0:39 FEMALE: That's cool. I graduated CS Masters.
0:38 0:39 MALE: From here? Sweet. What are you doing now?
0:41 0:49 FEMALE: I work at a company called Ingrian Networks. They do data encryption. It seems like a good market, I don't know. We'll see how it goes.
0:49 0:50 MALE: Are they right around here?
0:50 0:54 FEMALE: Yeah. They are in Redwood City. I joined them about two months ago. I was at Macromedia before that.
0:54 0:55 MALE: Cool. How was that?
0:55 0:55 FEMALE: It was good?
0:56 0:57 MALE: Doing flash or...?
0:57 1:06 FEMALE: I was working more on the Dreamweaver side. [unitelligible] Dreamweaver basically. So it's good. What do you like to do for fun?
1:07 1:07 MALE: Other than speed datng?
1:09 1:11 FEMALE: [laughter] Have you been doing this a lot?
1:12 1:16 MALE: This is my third time. But actually I met nameX at one of them. So and now we're friends and I was trying to help her get more women for tonight. What do I do? I do Quizbowl that's the big thing. I don't know if you know what that is.
1:17 1:17 FEMALE: What?
1:18 1:25 MALE: Quizbowl. It's like buzzer trivia. Academic team, you buzz in and answer the questions.
1:25 1:25 FEMALE: Sort of like Jeopardy?
1:26 1:33 MALE: Yeah. But on teams. Actually I just came from there. They're doing intramurals tonight. So I read one round of questions [unitelligible].
1:33 1:35 FEMALE: What's the weirdest question you get or have gotten?
1:36 2:07 MALE: Well there was one tournament. Okay. This is an academic tournament probably you know physics, history and literature. I got this question on Will and Grace, it was about Karen Walker. I don't know if you watch the show. But she's this really ridiculous rich woman who basically drinks all the time and takes pills. I don't know. She goes by the name Anastasia Beaverhousen whenever she doesn't want to be recognized.  So I heard Anastasia Beaverhousen, I buzz in and say Karen Walker in the middle of all of these things about [unitelligible] and all this physics stuff. I was most proud of that through the whole tournament.
2:09 2:09 FEMALE: That's funny.
2:10 2:17 MALE: Yeah, it's kind of bizarre. Usually I'm terrible at pop culture, I actually know the nerdy stuff. And then they're like name these bands and I'm like, Uhhh.
2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Me, too. Uhhh.
2:21 2:23 MALE: Yeah, exactly. What about you? What do you do for fun?
2:24 2:24 FEMALE: I like to play tennis.
2:25 2:27 MALE: Cool. I think nameX plays tennis too, right? Are you two friends?
2:28 2:30 FEMALE: Who?
2:31 2:31 MALE: nameX the organizer?
2:33 2:34 FEMALE: No. Actually I don't know her.
2:35 2:36 MALE: She seems to know a lot of women here.
2:36 2:37 FEMALE: I guess that's how she recruits. I read.
2:38 2:40 MALE: What do you like to read?
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: I just read Water Ship Down, it's about rabbits. It's the first time I read it.
2:42 2:42 MALE: I never read that actually.
2:43 2:45 FEMALE: It's like the greatest book, you have to read it.
2:47 2:49 MALE: Really? Is that Hazel and...?
2:50 2:53 FEMALE: Yeah. Hazel Ra or whatever, the same rabbit. It's a great book.
2:59 3:01 MALE: Yeah. Maybe I'll read it. Usually I like sci fi and that kind of stuff, some classics.
3:02 3:04 FEMALE: I'm going to go back and read Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy, just to--
3:05 3:07 MALE: Now that the movie's out.
3:07 3:10 FEMALE: I haven't read it in a long time. I think it's funnier when you're older.
3:11 3:17 MALE: I read it as a kid and I really liked it. I haven't gone back, maybe I should. Maybe there are things you can only appreciate as an adult.
3:18 3:35 FEMALE: In the beginning his house gets turn down and then next the earth was going to blow up, right? It's kind of like, oh, it's really funny now because they have the bureaucracy and they are posting his notice in the basement and he has to get a flashlight to go down and look at it. You're like, oh.
3:36 3:37 MALE: We posted the notice. Come on, guy. Then you're lying in front of the bulldozer.
3:37 3:41 FEMALE: Yeah. When you're a kid you're like, oh yeah whatever. Now you're like, it actually kind of happens.
3:41 3:42 MALE: That's how bureaucracy is.
3:42 3:44 FEMALE: [laughter] That's pretty funny.
3:45 3:47 MALE: So are you a competitive tennis player? I've never played really.
3:47 3:52 FEMALE: No. I play for fun. I was actually kind of looking for people to play with. It's just hard to find people on your level.
3:53 4:01 MALE: I know. nameX invited me to go play and I know nothing. Do you have any tips on tennis? I don't know. Keep your eye on the ball, I've heard.
4:02 4:02 FEMALE: Try to connect.
4:03 4:11 MALE: Follow through. Yeah. I think she totally kicked my butt. nameX if you're listening-- let me put this up here. You kicked my butt in tennis.
4:12 4:12 FEMALE: This thing is kind of weird.
4:13 4:18 MALE: This is kind of weird. I feel like I'm being watched. I don't know. Maybe you get used to it. [horn] You don't get used to that. That is ridiculous.
4:19 4:19 FEMALE: Oh my god.
4:21 4:23 MALE: Wow, okay. Good meeting you.
4:24 4:24 FEMALE: Nice meeting you, too. Take care.
4:25 4:25 MALE: Take it easy. Good luck tonight.
