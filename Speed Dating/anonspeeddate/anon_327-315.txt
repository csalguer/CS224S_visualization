0:03 0:05 MALE: Wow.  It gets shorter and shorter.
0:06 0:06 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:21 0:21 MALE: I'm male315.
0:22 0:23 FEMALE: Hi.  I'm female327.
0:24 0:26 MALE: female327, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself, and then I'll tell you about me.
0:26 0:32 FEMALE: All right.  Okay.  Um, I'm going to start then.  So I'm a fourth year student here in the school of education.
0:33 0:34 MALE: There's so many of you here in education.  
0:35 0:36 FEMALE: I know.  It's a little crazy.
0:36 0:38 MALE: I'm beginning to think you guys are all a part of the uh, a part of the little test here.
0:39 0:46 FEMALE: Yeah.  We are, because I don't think we really work with [unintelligible] and her, you know, her particular research project.  So.
0:46 0:47 MALE: Whatever that may be.
0:47 0:59 FEMALE: Yes.  Exactly.  Whatever she will find from this interesting experiment.  I study early childhood development, here, actually.  So it's very different from, I think, what nameX [phonetic] is interested in.
1:00 1:00 MALE: Yeah.
1:00 1:11 FEMALE: Um, and I'm kind of working on my dissertation field work right now.  I am originally from New York, but moved out here to the Bay area just for graduate school.  And it's been fun so far.
1:11 1:12 MALE: Where--you're in your fourth year?
1:13 1:13 FEMALE: Yes.
1:13 1:15 MALE: And it's a PhD, right?
1:15 1:15 FEMALE: Yes.
1:16 1:19 MALE: And so what is it, a five year PhD?  Or it's as long as you want to make it or?
1:19 1:22 FEMALE: It kind of is as long as you can draw it out, I suppose. 
1:22 1:22 MALE: Draw it out, yeah.
1:24 1:24 FEMALE: You know, [unintelligible].
1:25 1:27 MALE: What is--are you aiming then at finishing in four or five or?
1:27 1:40 FEMALE: I'm hoping to finish next year, actually.  I did some graduate work before coming here.  So I kind of have extended my graduate work over time. And so, well I think, I think in the next year or so it'll come together for me.
1:40 1:42 MALE: And what would you like to do afterwards?
1:42 1:46 FEMALE: Um, I'm hoping to kind of just do research for a while, get into a research institute of some sort.
1:47 1:48 MALE: Oh okay.  Awesome.
1:48 1:49 FEMALE: How about yourself?  What do you do here?
1:49 1:58 MALE: I, uh, am a Stanford undergrad, and then I went to New York, and uh, worked in New York for two years.  Then I was worked in Paris for four years.
1:59 1:59 FEMALE: Wow.
1:59 2:02 MALE: And now I'm back to business school.  I'm a first year, getting my, uh--
2:02 2:02 FEMALE: Yeah?
2:02 2:03 MALE: --my MBA.
2:04 2:07 FEMALE: Were you in finance when you were working in New York and abroad?
2:07 2:08 MALE: I was in banking, yeah, yeah.  So.
2:08 2:08 FEMALE: Okay.  
2:09 2:10 MALE: It's pretty, uh, pretty white bread--
2:10 2:13 FEMALE: [unintelligible] natural progression, I'm sure.
2:13 2:14 MALE: Yeah, no.  There's nothing unusual about that.
2:14 2:15 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].
2:15 2:16 MALE: So yeah.  Oh well.
2:16 2:17 FEMALE: So how'd you enjoy working in Paris?
2:17 2:18 MALE: Oh I had a great time.
2:19 2:19 FEMALE: Yeah?
2:19 2:21 MALE: I mean, it was, you know, the same firm as I worked for in New York.  And it was--
2:21 2:21 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:22 2:24 MALE: --just the same hours.  It was very similar.
2:24 2:24 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:25 2:29 MALE: So that was--but living there, the quality of life was just a lot higher.  So that was a lot more yet.
2:29 2:30  FEMALE: Yeah.  I can imagine.  Do you get to go back there or?
2:31 2:32 MALE: No.  Well I have a lot of friends there, now, obviously.
2:32 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:32 2:34 MALE: So I go back twice a year.
2:34 2:34 FEMALE: Oh cool.
2:35 2:35 MALE: Yeah.
2:36 2:39 FEMALE: That's great.  Do you enjoy traveling generally speaking or?
2:39 2:39 MALE: Yeah.  I'm a big traveler, yeah.
2:40 2:44 FEMALE: Yeah?  What's the most phenomenal place you've been so far?
2:45 2:51 MALE: I really enjoyed--uh, and I didn't think I would.  I thought it would be a little bit too like touristy, but I really enjoyed, uh, [unintelligible].
2:52 2:52 FEMALE: Really?
2:52 2:54 MALE: Yeah.  No, I did enjoy that.
2:55 2:55 FEMALE: Cool.
2:55 2:57 MALE: And in terms of like cultural places I've been--
2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:58 3:01 MALE: I think that probably, you know, Berlin or Amsterdam.
3:02 3:02 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:02 3:04 MALE: Or Rome is actually my favorite city in Euro
3:04 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:05 3:06 MALE: I've never lived there, but.
3:06 3:06 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:06 3:07 MALE: It's fun to visit.
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: Ye
3:08 3:08 MALE: So how about you?
3:08 3:17 FEMALE: Definitely.  I enjoy traveling.  I mean, I kind of--I actually studied abroad for a bit when I was in college.  And it was fun.  I got to do a little bit of traveling then.
3:17 3:18 MALE: Where did you go to college?
3:19 3:24 FEMALE: Um, I was at Cornell University.  Yeah.  And uh, I studied abroad in Denmark and Copenhagen.
3:25 3:25 MALE:  In Copenhagen.
3:27 3:27 FEMALE: It's definitely fun.
3:27 3:28 MALE: Very oh--do you speak Danish?
3:28 3:32 FEMALE: Um, I'm sure I know like bits and phrases, but not really.
3:32 3:34 MALE: Bits and pieces.  But they all speak English better than we do, so there' no reason to--
3:34 3:42 FEMALE: Yeah.  I know.  True, but, uh, yeah.  I don't think you'd want to hear me speak Danish.  I don't think they would want to hear me speak Danish.  But, uh, yeah.
3:42 3:45 MALE: Awesome.  And do you live in Escondido, or do you live off campus or?
3:45 3:48 FEMALE: Um, yeah, I live in one of the studios that's on campus.
