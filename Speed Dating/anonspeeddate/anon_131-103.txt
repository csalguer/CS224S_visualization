FILE NAME: Male Speaker 103 - Female Speaker 131

0:01 0:04 FEMALE:  I was getting good at this.  Now it's taking me so long.  
0:05 0:14 MALE:  I'm a first-year doctoral student.  I'm [unintelligible].  What are you studying?  What's your name?  
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female131.  
0:20 0:20 MALE:  male103.  
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you. female131.  
0:22 0:23 MALE:  female131, you got to cover them up.  
0:23 0:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, I should actually just move it to there.  I don't really care.  I'm at the law school right now.  
0:31 0:32 MALE:  First year?  
0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  First year.  
0:33 0:35 MALE:  First year.  How [unintelligible] right now?  
0:35 0:42 FEMALE:  Uhm, supposedly.  So, I [unintelligible] studying them.  So they're--they must be kidding.  [laughter]
0:43 0:44 MALE:  Well you have to [unintelligible].  
0:45 1:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, actually because everyone says I'm [unintelligible] I should be good at it.  I just don't know.  Yeah, I think I like [unintelligible] the party life.  I don't go out.  Yeah, I mean I came here because I was looking for a more social atmosphere, and I didn't want to go to [unintelligible] and beg for that.  What department are you in?  
1:05 1:06 MALE:  The business school.  
1:06 1:08 FEMALE:  Okay, are you a first-year or second-year?  
1:08 1:09 MALE:  Second-year.  
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:10 1:12 MALE:  I [unintelligible].  
1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  Wow, wow, I'm actually going to be going [unintelligible].  
1:15 1:16 MALE:  Oh really?  Where is that?  
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  I'm going to [unintelligible].  
1:18 1:19 MALE:  Good for you.  Good for you, yeah.  
1:19 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, yeah I think that is actually going to be really fun.  
1:24 1:24 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
1:25 1:28 MALE:  So what do you want to do after that?  
1:29 1:59 FEMALE:  You know, I'm actually pretty sure I want to [unintelligible], and because I'm pretty sure I do want to at least try law, I have a sense that I might just want to end up going to business school.  But I applied for both in the same year, and [unintelligible] the law program but was kind of on the fence about the business program.  So, I sort of think, well, [unintelligible] I have the opportunity to get the degree.  So, obviously, I mean for half the cost.  Because you only pay for the extra year, and wouldn't it just be stupid to pass up that opportunity.  
2:00 2:01 MALE:  You know. You know.  
2:01 2:11 FEMALE:  I think again there were some people at the business school that think that the first year of business school is actually kind of rigorous.  But I think that's the reason [unintelligible] I think it's going to be really fun.  
2:11 2:12 MALE:  You get to know people really good there.  
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, do you have a good time at the business school?  
2:15 2:19 MALE:  We have a great time.  Every quarter [unintelligible].  
2:19 2:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, when you're taking all the foundational courses and stuff.  That's [unintelligible].  
2:25 2:30 MALE:  Otherwise, it's great.  [unintelligible].  Good.  
2:34 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, well, you know, I went up to the [unintelligible] that was on two weeks ago.  And it was actually when we saw the [unintelligible], but--you probably remember this, but when they actually they're all sitting in that room talking about [unintelligible] something that people love.  I was so humbled by-
2:51 2:52 MALE:   [interposing]  [unintelligible].  
2:53 3:06 FEMALE: I was like, whoa, you know.  I'm like, a lot of people that are up on that [unintelligible] of what I've done.  But what other people have done, this was just so much more impressive.  And he tells us [unintelligible] are you girls supposed to be [unintelligible] those people?  He sounds horrible.  
3:08 3:09 MALE:  So, [unintelligible] around here?  
3:10 3:38 FEMALE: [unintelligible].  I  mean we go out a lot.  Um, yeah, we do work a lot, but I'd say we get out a lot more often than I would have expected.  Like we go out like how often the [unintelligible] to tell you we're on campus--probably like a couple of times a week.  And, you know, well, I play tennis.  [unintelligible]  I'll go skiing, not her.  I really don't know much about that too in this field.  I understand that my [unintelligible].  
3:39 3:42 MALE:  Yes, [unintelligible].  
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  What about you guys?  
3:44 3:49 MALE:  Well, I have a motorcycle.  I have a Harley.  That's where a lot of time is.  I spend my whole [unintelligible].  There's-
3:50 3:50 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] significant other?  
3:51 3:53 MALE:  Yeah, exactly, [unintelligible].  I have a girl--my baby.  
3:53 3:54 FEMALE:  Does she have a name?  
3:54 3:55 MALE:  [unintelligible].  
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  Do you have a [unintelligible]?  
3:58 4:00 MALE:  No.  [crosstalk]  [unintelligible] but it's good to meet you.  
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
4:04 4:05 MALE:  Good luck, all right.
