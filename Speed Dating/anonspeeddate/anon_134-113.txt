0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  Yeah?  Are you surprised--like what year are you?  
0:10 0:11 MALE:  Year five.  
0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  Really?  
0:12 0:13 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
0:13 0:15 FEMALE:  How many years is that is the PhD?  
0:16 0:17 MALE:  Normally it's like six.  
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:18 0:19 MALE:  It's a PhD.
0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  Wow, so when did you graduate from [unintelligible]?  
0:21 0:22 MALE:  2000.  
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  Oh, me too.  
0:23 0:24 MALE:  Okay, all right.  
0:24 0:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're--
0:27 0:27 MALE:  [interposing]  What are you doing here then?  
0:28 0:29 FEMALE:  Oh, I'm in law school.  
0:29 0:31 MALE:  Oh, okay. That's like hardcore.  
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  It's pretty hardcore.  
0:33 0:34 MALE:  Do you like it, or is it--
0:35 0:37 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, I mean I like it.  Like [unintelligible].  
0:38 0:39 MALE:  Oh, okay, okay.  
0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  The first year is the hardest.  
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Oh really.
0:42 0:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:42 0:45 MALE:  It would take a year to get to know everybody, and like--yeah.  
0:45 0:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's definitely part of it, and it's kind of like a hazing process.  
0:49 0:50 MALE:  Oh, no kidding.  
0:50 0:59 FEMALE:  So, yeah.  It's tough especially for a [unintelligible] out there.  But now, I mean it's so close to the end, you know.  Everybody's like [unintelligible].  
0:59 1:07 MALE:  Yeah, time kind of flies, you know.  Cause I had a friend who was in law school, and she didn't know exactly what she wanted to do afterwards or if she wanted to be a lawyer.  
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:08 1:10 MALE:  She was just kind of doing it cause she got in I guess.  
1:11 1:13 FEMALE:  I think that's what a lot of people do actually.  Was she at Stanford?  
1:14 1:19 MALE:  Yeah, she was at Stanford.  I think she graduated already, yeah.  It's three years right?  
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:19 1:21 MALE: So, I think she would be done by now.  
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  So where did you go undergrad? 
1:23 1:24 MALE:  Oh, I went to Princeton.  
1:24 1:25 FEMALE:  Okay, are you from the East Coast?  
1:26 1:29 MALE:  Nope, So Cal, the "O.C."
1:31 1:34 FEMALE:  Yeah, this is my first time living on the West Coast.  
1:34 1:36 MALE:  Oh, really? It's so much better, right?  
1:36 1:40 FEMALE:  I like it.  What do you think about northern California verus southern California?  
1:41 2:00 MALE:  I don't know.  I was kind of--cause I'm here at a different age, you know.  In southern California I didn't really go places or hang out.  It was jus mostly--well, I mean during like high school I was so academic that was like it.  I was like programmed.  That was my one thing.  
2:00 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Different [unintelligible] or have you paid for it since you've been back.  
2:07 2:19 MALE:  I would say it changed me.  I guess I kind of like got more laid back about things and more, you know, less I was actually more ambitious before almost you could say.  
2:19 2:20 FEMALE:  I feel the same way actually.  
2:21 2:23 MALE: Now I just kind of have wider interests.  
2:23 2:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think it's good though.  I think it's so much better than [unintelligible].  
2:27 2:27 MALE:  Yeah. 
2:28 2:35 FEMALE:  But I mean [unintelligible] this year, and there's a real difference because they're a lot more like tunnel vision about what they want.  
2:36 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  And cut throat ambitious.  
2:39 2:41 MALE:  So you guys don't help each other and stuff?  
2:41 2:47 FEMALE:  I mean it's not as competitive as it could be, but I think it's kind of more competitive [unintelligible].  
2:47 2:47 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:48 2:54 FEMALE:  The people are nice, but I think there's a lot of [unintelligible].  
2:55 2:55 MALE:  Okay.  
2:56 3:01 FEMALE:  But no one is like flat out mean like you hear war stories about [unintelligible].  
3:01 3:06 MALE:  [unintelligible] Like have you seen the paper chase?  
3:07 3:08 FEMALE:  You know what I wouldn't let myself go see it.  
3:09 3:11 MALE:  Oh really. That's like my whole conception of law school.  
3:12 3:12 FEMALE:  Really?  
3:12 3:13 MALE:  Cause I saw it when I was in high school.  
3:13 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, and I'm sure that probably convinced you never to go to law school.  
3:17 3:18 MALE: Yeah, pretty much.  
3:18 3:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean now, I'm trying to think if there's a [unintelligible] about it.  And honestly it's probably more like Legally Blonde than anything.  
3:25 3:26 MALE:  That's what I was thinking too.  
3:27 3:38 FEMALE:  I mean, you know, if a [unintelligible] can be very [unintelligible].  I'm not that big of a fan of the psychotic method, but that's fine.  Like it definitely gets less stressful, and just the fact that you're in California I think--
3:38 3:40 MALE:  [interposing]  Oh really?  Where were you from before?  
3:41 3:42 FEMALE:  Oh, I grew up in North Carolina.  
3:42 3:44 MALE:  Oh, that's a really different place.  
3:44 3:46 FEMALE:  It is really different. Okay. 
3:47 3:48 MALE:  So you worked there?  
3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, I was a high school teacher.  
3:52 3:53 MALE:  What was that experience like?  
3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  It was awesome.  
3:55 3:59 MALE:  Just out of college you're still pretty--you're not that much older than those kids, right?  
4:00 4:03 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] faster. 
4:05 4:06 MALE:  It was good meeting you, female134.  
4:07 4:08 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you too.
