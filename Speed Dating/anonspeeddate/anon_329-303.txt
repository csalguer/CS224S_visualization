0:45 0:48 MALE:  Well, [unintelligible] comfort and [laughter] thought it was going to be--
0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  [interposing] Okay.
0:49 0:51 MALE:  I thought it was going to be like--something like--
0:50 0:53 FEMALE:  [interposing] Well, it's goof-off after the first year.  The second year's total goof-off.
0:54 0:55 MALE:  [unintelligible].  So you're an expert in business management?
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  I know enough.
0:57 0:57 MALE:  What do--what are you doing?
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  I'm a product designer.
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Oh.
0:59 1:04 FEMALE:  I'm a product designer, mechanical engineering, but I have a lot of friends in the business school so I hear stories.
1:04 1:04 MALE:  Oh.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  And I understand how it works.
1:05 1:05 MALE:  I see.
1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  And I thought about going to business school.
1:07 1:07 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:07 1:08 FEMALE:  I'm like no, not for me.
1:08 1:08 MALE:  Why not?
1:09 1:12 FEMALE:  Uh it's--[Break in audio]--oh no.
1:12 1:12 MALE:  You're done now.
1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  [laughter].
1:13 1:13 MALE:  She's done.
1:15 1:17 FEMALE:  That's a good way to hide this.  I know, seriously right.
1:17 1:17 MALE:  Where you going to put it?
1:18 1:42 FEMALE:  Um I decided--like I'm not into the--I mean, business is all about making money to me.  I mean kind of what I assumed like, and I'm just not like that.  Like I get bored with that.  And it's like I want to do something creative, 'cause I mean, I actually did consulting for a while.  And I worked in a software startup, and so we had some business stuff.  And it's just like managing and all that good stuff, it's not for me.  Like I mean, I like people but not the managing.  I want to do stuff.  I want to make stuff.  I want to--
1:43 1:43 MALE:  [interposing] So what gets you excited?
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  Um making things, doing the professional expression of me.  I love art.
1:47 1:47 MALE:  So whatever you--
1:48 2:05 FEMALE:  [interposing] Um I like painting.  Painting I love.  Like I adore painting.  I love writing, but it has nothing to do with product design.  I just love creative writing in general.  Um and I love making things, so furniture and stuff, like wood and metal, which I haven't done a lot of but I'm doing like little things.  I love making jewelry, so like things out of cast metal, like um silver and stuff like that.
2:06 2:07 MALE:  Are you wearing any of your--
2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  [interposing] Um what am I--today?
2:09 2:09 MALE:  I guess.
2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  Nope, not making any--not wearing anything that I made.
2:12 2:12 MALE:  Oh, okay.
2:12 2:26 FEMALE:  Um so, but uh--then I'm currently making skirts for my thesis, and I made a lamp, which I thought was pretty cool.  I've made bags.  So, you know, I like making things.  
2:26 2:26 MALE:  Okay.
2:26 2:27 FEMALE:  Making things is fun.
2:27 2:27 MALE:  Nice.
2:28 2:30 FEMALE:  So what do you like to do?  What gets you all psyched?
2:33 2:34 MALE:  I have to say that that's a great question.
2:35 2:40 FEMALE:  No, don't say that.  That's a stalling technique in a business interview.  It's not allowed here.  [laughter].
2:40 2:43 MALE:  All right.  Then I won't do it again.  Right now, what I like doing--
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
2:44 2:47 MALE:  --is really kind of shallow, but like I love playing golf.  I love kind of running.
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:48 2:54 MALE:  Like I totally was not running, I'm like all right.  I need a ball to run after.  I can't just run for running's sake.
2:54 2:55 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Next time I see you, I will roll a ball in front of you.  
2:55 2:55 MALE:  Roll it.
2:56 2:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  [laughter].
2:57 3:04 MALE:  You know, I just like working out.  I'm like more like physical things right now, and I think, you know, in part because when you get so taxed mentally--
3:04 3:04 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
3:05 3:08 MALE:  Um but in terms of like mental things, like I love kind of being challenged.  Something--
3:09 3:09 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
3:09 3:15 MALE:  Um before I was like in sports marketing, but like I worked all this summer for wireless and internet stuff that I had never done before.
3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:16 3:20 MALE:  And the whole idea that was like all right, we don't know how to do this.  You figure it out.  I was like sweet.
3:21 3:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's really cool.
3:22 3:23 MALE:  We're like all right, done you know.
3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:24 3:25 MALE:  So I definitely like those kinds of challenges as well.
3:25 3:26 FEMALE:  Do you like puzzles?
3:26 3:26 MALE:  I do.
3:27 3:28 FEMALE:  Like really like puzzles?
3:29 3:32 MALE:  I mean, they're all right.  We definitely did a lot of puzzles when I was young.
3:32 3:32 FEMALE:  Really?
3:32 3:32 MALE:  Yeah.
3:33 3:35 FEMALE:  Have you ever heard of this thing called Not Prom on the internet?
3:36 3:36 MALE:  No.
3:36 3:44 FEMALE:  Okay.  This is me being a dork.  But there's this huge puzzle thingy on the internet called Not Prom, N-O-T-P-R-O-M, like not porn but prom.  Um and so--
3:45 3:46 MALE:  Are you telling me to look at porn on the internet?
3:47 3:48 FEMALE:  No, it says Not Prom, so not porn.
3:48 3:49 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah.
3:50 4:07 FEMALE:  [laughter].  But anyways, it's got these crazy games, like crazy puzzles where they just give you like a website and you need to figure out how to get to the next page, the next site.  So like they go from one to 82 and then they have the name and numbers, too.  So it's like you have to figure out how to go from number one to number two to number three.  And it's like you don't even know how to start, but you just got to figure it out step-by-step.  It's insane.
4:08 4:08 MALE:  So do you--
4:08 4:15 FEMALE:  So if you ever interested, you could--that was--I'm sorry.  I just had to tell you 'cause I think it's the coolest thing.  [laughter].
4:13 4:15 MALE:  Don't be sorry.  It was nice meeting you.
4:16 4:16 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
