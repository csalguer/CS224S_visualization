2:04 2:07 MALE: Um, so, like, it's mainly, mainly Russian uh--  
    
1:53 1:54 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  
    
2:08 2:09 MALE: --[unintelligible] some other Slavic languages.

2:11 2:12 MALE: Eastern European studies.

2:02 2:04 FEMALE: Business, electrical engineering.  
    
2:17 2:28 MALE: Business, business or engineers, yeah.

2:13 2:14 FEMALE: So they're like, oh that's cool.  
    
2:29 2:38 MALE: On the plus side, though, 'cause I guess on the negative side it puts a lot of pressure on you to think of a really clever reason why you study Russian.  So it's like, you study engineering you're another [unintelligible].  
    
2:24 2:25 FEMALE: Yeah.  
    
2:38 2:44 MALE: You're like, oh, engineering, okay.  It's like Russian is, why--?  Okay why the hell does he have to like [unintelligible].

2:35 2:36 FEMALE: Oh okay.  
    
2:49 2:53 MALE: So like, I'm, so it's like, no matter what it's always not that not that cool actually.
