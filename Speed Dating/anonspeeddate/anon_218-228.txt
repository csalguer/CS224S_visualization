0:00 0:22 MALE:  Ew.  I'm still having a really hard time figuring out how ambitious people are after like four minutes of meeting them.  Like, I'm trying to figure out are we supposed to say like ambitious compared to like if you were just to grab a rent a person off the street or like ambitious for like people at Stanford?  Because it seems like--

0:22 0:22 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] qualified [unintelligible]?

0:23 0:25 MALE:  Right.  Because it seems like--it seems like it's sort of a different scale, right, like trying to figure out--trying to figure out which is which.

0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] what do you mean are they going to change schedules or do they [unintelligible] or what?

0:27 0:31 MALE:  Right.  I mean, yeah, what is--yeah, what is--yeah, so, I'm having--that's--that's the one I always get hung up on.

0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] to help people?

0:34 0:34 MALE:  Right.  Right.  I think I'm just going to give like straight nines from now on because I'm figuring--I'm figuring everyone here is probably pretty ambitious.

0:35 0:39 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] we are at Stanford, right?

0:39 0:40 MALE:  Right.  I mean, like--I don't know.  Um, so--

0:40 0:43 FEMALE:  Tell me about you?

0:43 0:44 MALE:  Tell you about myself?

0:45 0:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:51 0:52 MALE:  I am a third year in the Slavic languages and literature program, um--

0:52 0:53 FEMALE:  That's [unintelligible].  Tell me--tell me why you are doing Slavic languages and literature?

0:54 0:58 MALE:  Why I am doing Slavic languages and literature.  That is a good question and I just had a big thing of exams--a big [unintelligible] over spring break even.  So, everybody was off in like Acapulco or whatever, people to, um--

0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Or [unintelligible].

0:59 1:02 MALE:  Yeah, okay, or people like in Vegas, like my friends.  And I was sitting by the fountain outside Green Library and I was thinking to myself that exact question.  Some of--

1:02 1:10 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]?

1:10 1:23 MALE:  Yeah, why am I studying Slavic literature.  I guess it's because I do have a little interesting literature, which I try to remind myself of a lot.  

1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:24 1:34 MALE:  And I do have an interest in--in Russian.  And I actually really like teaching Russian too.  I teach one of the Russian classes here right now.  And that is a lot of fun.

1:35 1:36 FEMALE:  Okay.  Cool.  [unintelligible] obviously it's a personal thing for you.

1:37 1:37 MALE:  Yeah and a couple of other like--

1:37 1:53 FEMALE:  I mean, I guess that would be useful if you're teaching a Russian.

1:53 1:53 MALE:  It does.  You would be surprised.  You would be surprised how useful it really it.

1:54 1:57 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Um, but I have taken a few language classes at other places where I'm not really sure if they--and that was actually here through the special languages department, so that's actually a [unintelligible] does sort of happen [unintelligible].

1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Can you speak other languages?

2:00 2:01 MALE:  Yeah, I do, uh, [unintelligible] German, a little bit of Spanish.

2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  Wow.

2:02 2:03 MALE:  Um, and then--

2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  Where did you learn [unintelligible]?

2:04 2:04 MALE:  Uh, through the special languages department they--they--

2:04 2:05 FEMALE:  Is it related to [unintelligible] Russian?

2:05 2:06 MALE:  It's related, yeah, it has a lot of--it has a lot of similarities.

2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:07 2:08 MALE:  Which is sort of good and sort of bad.  Like sometimes I'm speaking Russian with the--with like a [unintelligible] accent, which doesn't always go that well in [unintelligible].

2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  Right.

2:09 2:11 MALE:  But, yeah, they're--they're pretty similar.  Um--

2:11 2:12 FEMALE:  Have you been over there [unintelligible]?

2:12 2:14 MALE:  Oh, two summers ago I spent--I was like all over [unintelligible] Yugoslavia.  I [unintelligible] Serbia, Baldrade from there.

2:15 2:23 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  

2:23 2:24 MALE:  Yeah, no [unintelligible] beaches.  I have seem to recommend even more Monte Negro because--yeah they're like--there aren't as many like Western European stores.  The same quality of beaches and it's a lot like it's cheaper, it's like a little bit wilder.  I mean, just as far as like it doesn't feel like--it doesn't feel like it's--it doesn't really have any new influence already.  So, it's still like--it's a little bit of what you might imagine Eastern Europe is sort of like.  That is like where a lot of serves hang out and they're pretty--they're pretty fun.

2:24 2:28 FEMALE:  That is cool.

2:29 2:30 MALE:  How about yourself?  Tell--tell me about yourself [unintelligible].

2:30 2:33 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] MBA [unintelligible] this is the business row.

2:34 2:35 MALE:  This is the business row.  Oh, right, right.  Then we get into the education row I've heard.

2:35 2:39 FEMALE:  Oh--oh, really.  

2:39 2:40 MALE:  Yeah.

2:40 2:42 FEMALE:  That is funny how that spreads around.

2:42 2:43 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess--yeah, from word of mouth.

2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:44 2:46 MALE:  I've--actually what I've also heard is there are some engineers and a bunch are from Colorado.  Because I'm from Colorado myself.

2:47 2:51 FEMALE:  Oh, really?

2:51 2:51 MALE:  Because I'm from Colorado myself. 

2:52 2:55 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

2:55 2:59 MALE:  So--

2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  Where did you grow up in Colorado?

2:59 3:00 MALE:  I grew up in Boulder.

3:00 3:03 FEMALE:  Okay.

3:04 3:06 MALE:  How about yourself?

3:06 3:15 FEMALE:  I'm from Menlo Park.

3:15 3:16 MALE:  Okay.  Okay.  But your mom is--

3:17 3:22 FEMALE:  And I moved very far away.

3:23 3:23 MALE:  Okay.  Interesting.  Yeah, so Menlo Park all the way to Palo Alto.  How was the adjustment from one to the other?

3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  Culture shock.

3:24 3:24 MALE:  Culture shock.  [unintelligible].

3:25 3:27 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

3:27 3:30 MALE:  Right, I could see that.  I could see that.  Actually, [unintelligible] like the Mile Pale or Trader Joe's [unintelligible] you'd be surprised at how helpful Russian is around here, survival skills.  

3:30 3:32 FEMALE:  Um, I--I went to UCLA as a under grad, so [unintelligible] five years down in LA.

3:33 3:33 MALE:  [unintelligible].

3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] for a little bit, but [unintelligible] but not a whole lot.  But I have done a lot of traveling [unintelligible] I actually visited Russia and I graduated [unintelligible] my under grad traveling around the world for six months [unintelligible].

3:35 3:38 MALE:  Ew, that's a really--that's a really good idea.  How--where did you go in Russia, like, Moscow, Petersburg or anything further [unintelligible]?
