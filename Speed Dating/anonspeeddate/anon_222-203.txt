2:16 2:16 MALE: It's fun, it's fun.

2:17 2:17 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

2:45 2:53 MALE: And uh, and I think other stuff like I've been doing -- um, I had an allergy of eggs until about a year ago.  And then I discovered I can eat eggs, so -

2:53 2:53 FEMALE: Allergy?

2:54 2:56 MALE: Yeah, if I ate eggs, my throat would swell shut and -

2:57 2:57 FEMALE: Really?

2:58 3:01 MALE: And peanuts.  So peanuts, I still can't have.  Eggs, I can eat, and I have to find -

3:03 3:04 MALE: That's not so bad.

3:05 3:05 FEMALE: Okay, but you can eat eggs now.

3:06 3:10 MALE: Yeah, exactly, so I'm just -- how about yourself, what interests do you like?

3:26 3:26 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

3:27 3:27 MALE: Yeah, that's -

3:28 3:32 FEMALE: Yeah, and I don't know, just -- and like, yeah, anything that doesn't require much brainpower.

3:33 3:35 MALE: 'Cause there's enough of that during school, you just -

3:36 3:39 FEMALE: Yeah, I like to like just chill out at coffee shops, or the beach.

3:40 3:43 MALE: Yeah, I haven't gone to the beach in nearly -- barely ever go, and it's sad.

3:44 3:44 FEMALE: Really?

3:44 3:47 MALE: [unintelligible] the ocean, aw it's so nice, and spend any time there, it's sad.

3:49 3:49 FEMALE: Aw.
