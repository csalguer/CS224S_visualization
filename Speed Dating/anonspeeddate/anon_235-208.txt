0:17 0:23 FEMALE:  Oh thank you, it's growing out, I want to dye it back, but I have to look for a job soon, so you never know.  

0:31 0:32 MALE:  I had long hair half --  

0:25 0:25 FEMALE:  Oh you did?  

0:34 0:37 MALE:  A long way down my back and I got it cut for a job interviews.  

0:30 0:32 FEMALE:  Oh I know it's so painful to change it.  

0:40 0:40 MALE:  Yeah I know.  

0:33 0:34 FEMALE:  Are you growing it back out now?  

0:42 0:47 MALE:  Well this was a few years ago and then as soon as I got the job, as soon as I got the offer I started growing it out again.  

0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  It's like the way I am too.  

0:48 0:48 MALE:  Yeah [laughter].  

0:41 0:44 FEMALE:  I'm like, you will like me for my skills right, not for how I look.

0:59 0:59 MALE:  Yeah.  

0:51 0:57 FEMALE:  I used to have long hair too, but I cut it because I wanted to, but I thought it was really -- for me it's really hard to go back to long hair after you cut it off.  

1:06 1:07 MALE:  So what does the hair say about you?  

0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  What does it say?  

1:08 1:08 MALE:  Yeah.  

1:01 1:11 FEMALE:  Well I'd hope that nothing, well I feel like people would assume then that I like, like rock music, which I do actually, so maybe they're right I'm not sure.  I like the color blue.  

1:20 1:20 MALE:  You like?  

1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  I like blue, I don't know [laughter].

1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  Okay.  

1:51 1:55 MALE:  And so there's so many things going on and it's kind of hard to get out of the Business School environment.  

1:46 1:50 FEMALE:  No, definitely is.  Even though the city is not that far away, like, it can be really hard to go.  

1:58 2:05 MALE:  Yeah, but I'm really, really excited going to San Francisco because I'm a big city person and I don't like being out here in the suburbs.
