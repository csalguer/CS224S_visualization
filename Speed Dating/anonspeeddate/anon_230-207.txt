0:02 0:03 FEMALE: It's the weirdest thing.

0:03 0:05 MALE: I know.  I feel bad, like.

0:04 0:05 FEMALE: It is so weird.

0:05 0:07 MALE: I feel bad rating people.

0:07 0:09 FEMALE: It's just like--almost dehumanizing, I hate to say it.

0:10 0:15 MALE: male207.

0:15 0:16 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  

0:15 0:16 MALE: How you doing?

0:16 0:17 FEMALE: It's with a G?  Not with a J?

0:17 0:18 MALE: Idiotic, huh?

0:18 0:19 FEMALE: Where are you from?

0:19 0:24 MALE: I'm from Virginia.  [unintelligible] that's just stupid.  I hate it.  I mean I don't really hate it, I like it.

0:24 0:25 FEMALE: Your parents--

0:25 0:26 MALE: My parents.

0:25 0:26 FEMALE: --decided to be unique.

0:26 0:27 MALE: Yeah.  

0:26 0:31 FEMALE: Don't worry, my real name is female230, female230.  I think there's not a single girl where I'm from with that name.

0:30 0:31 MALE: [unintelligible].

0:31 0:32 FEMALE: I checked, like, the telephone book once.

0:32 0:33 MALE: Oh yeah?

0:33 0:34 FEMALE: [horn] [unintelligible] pronounce [unintelligible].

0:34 0:35 MALE: Good to be unique though, huh?

0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Well.

0:36 0:37 MALE: Where you from?

0:37 0:38 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore.

0:37 0:38 MALE: Okay.  

0:38 0:42 FEMALE: My brothers had even worse names, and from what they tell me, sometimes being unique can be irritating, so--

0:42 0:43 MALE: Ah.

0:43 0:45 FEMALE: So depends how unique [unintelligible].

0:44 0:46 MALE: So your English is pretty awesome.

0:46 0:51 FEMALE: Well, everybody thinks--everybody says that, but actually Singapore, in Singapore English is the first language.

0:51 0:52 MALE: Okay.

0:52 0:54 FEMALE: So it'd be really strange if my English wasn't good.

0:54 0:55 MALE: Is that what you--?

0:55 0:57 FEMALE: So I wouldn't be able to talk to my parents.  I mean that's all we--that's all we use.  

0:57 0:58 MALE: Oh okay.  

0:57 1:01 FEMALE: We don't use Mandarin.  Mandarin is sort of talked, spoken only in schools, like--

1:01 1:02 MALE: Okay.  

1:02 1:05 FEMALE: As part of second language program.  I mean is Spanish your second language or--?

1:05 1:06 MALE: I don't--

1:05 1:06 FEMALE: Oh.

1:06 1:10 MALE: I have no second language.  German, but, yeah, really bad.

1:10 1:12 FEMALE: German, German heritage, your family?

1:12 1:16 MALE: Yeah.  But that's, I mean, I just started taking it in eighth grade and, like, I don't know.

1:17 1:19 FEMALE: That's interesting.  Did they pick for you?  Like, German, or--

1:19 1:28 MALE: No, I mean I guess I thought--I picked it.  Thinking, thinking partially of like the, slightly because of the heritage and also just out of friends, just a couple years older that took German and it sounded cool.

1:29 1:32 FEMALE: The only thing I know is [foreign language] which I've heard many times.

1:32 1:33 MALE: There you go.

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: But uh--

1:35 1:36 MALE: So yeah, so Singapore.

1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:36 1:37 MALE: That's cool.  

1:37 1:38 FEMALE: Have you ever been to Asia or--?

1:38 1:41 MALE: I've--I've been to Asia.  I went to Hong Kong actually, last October.  And Bali.

1:42 1:46 FEMALE: Bali, wow.  Definitely after what happened, though--

1:46 1:47 MALE: Yeah.

1:46 1:51 FEMALE: , and the tsunamis, I mean, I think Bali--Bali was not directly hit for the tsunamis I think.

1:49 1:50 MALE: That's pretty far away.

1:50 1:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:51 1:53 MALE: It's like way down [unintelligible].

1:51 1:57 FEMALE: It's not, but I mean, in general people hear about that part of the world and they don't feel like going there anymore.

1:56 1:57 MALE: Right.  

1:57 1:59 FEMALE: --because of what happened.  So tourism is, like, seriously down there.

1:59 2:00 MALE: I wonder how--

2:00 2:01 FEMALE: Even Singapore, we're slightly affected by that.

2:02 2:10 MALE: I wonder how bad--I mean, I guess it's funny how, like, American press is so fickle.  You know, you hear about it, that's like all you hear about for a couple weeks, and then, now--

2:10 2:18 FEMALE: People's attention span is short, so--what can you say.  Even the war, I mean, such a serious, I mean, you guys embarked on a serious war, and then after a while, now, if you look--

2:18 2:19 MALE: You got it.

2:18 2:21 FEMALE: --on the news, other than Daily Show--one of my roommates, uh we have TiVo-- 

2:21 2:22 MALE: Yeah.  

2:21 2:25 FEMALE: --one of my roommates tapes all The Daily Shows and you still get [unintelligible] about the war.

2:25 2:26 MALE: [unintelligible].

2:25 2:26 FEMALE: [unintelligible] do you watch that?

2:26 2:32 MALE: You guys?  Am I associated with you guys?  You guys went into this war?  I didn't go into this war.  I guess I do.  No, I do, I watch The Daily Show.  I love it.

2:32 2:33 FEMALE: It's hilarious.

2:33 2:34 MALE: Yeah.  

2:33 2:38 FEMALE: I mean I, I don't know what politics mine would fall under, because, you know, being not American I can't--

2:38 2:39 MALE: Right.   

2:38 2:42 FEMALE: really classify myself as Republican or whatever, but I think he's hilarious.

2:42 2:45 MALE: You know male207 Bush is an idiot, at least, right?

2:44 2:46 FEMALE: I am from Yale, so--

2:46 2:48 MALE: Oh really.  Yale, man.

2:48 2:50 FEMALE: Lay off of the--lay off on the Bushisms, but uh--

2:49 2:50 MALE: Did you like Yale?

2:50 2:57 FEMALE: I loved it.  It was my first time in the States too.  The only problem was I think Yale was way too cold.  It was like seven months of every year.

2:57 2:58 MALE: Right.  

2:57 3:06 FEMALE: It's nothing but snow and rain or snow and rain and snow, depending on which comes first.  So that was kind of yuck.  Virginia is freezing too, no?  Not, not that bad?

3:06 3:11 MALE: It's not as bad as Connecticut.  My mom's actually from Waterberg, so, and I went to Princeton.

3:11 3:12 FEMALE: That's real nearby isn't it?

3:12 3:13 MALE: Yeah.  

3:13 3:14 FEMALE: You went to Princeton?

3:14 3:16 MALE: Undergrad at Princeton.

3:15 3:16 FEMALE: Sorry, you guys don't matter.  [laughter].

3:17 3:20 MALE: You know, it's funny you think that, but I know for--

3:20 3:23 FEMALE: Yeah.  That's, that's on our T-shirts.  [unintelligible] get it from.

3:23 3:24 MALE: What year did you graduate?

3:24 3:26 FEMALE: Uh last year.  So I've been here a year--

3:25 3:26 MALE: '04?  People--

3:26 3:31 FEMALE: --yeah.  [unintelligible] I actually did--yeah, I did college in three, so actually I'm supposed to be [unintelligible] now.

3:30 3:32 MALE: Oh my god, you're only 21 huh?

3:32 3:33 FEMALE: No.

3:32 3:33 MALE: A young'n.

3:33 3:40 FEMALE: Dude, I'm not that [unintelligible].  [laughter]  Being Singaporean, our education system is a bit different.

3:40 3:41 MALE: Okay.  

3:40 3:41 FEMALE: so when I came to the States I was already 19.  

3:41 3:42 MALE: Okay.  

3:42 3:43 FEMALE: So now I'm 23.

3:43 3:45 MALE: Okay.  That's, that's more reasonable.

3:44 3:46 FEMALE: You're younger than me?

3:45 3:46 MALE: No, I'm 25.

3:46 3:47 FEMALE: You're 25?

3:46 3:47 MALE: I just turned 25.

3:47 3:49 FEMALE: So when did you graduate?  Like two years ago?

3:49 3:50 MALE: '02.

3:50 3:52 FEMALE: Okay.  What do you do now?

3:52 3:53 MALE: PhD in electrical engineering.

3:53 3:54 FEMALE: EE?

3:54 3:55 MALE: Yeah.  How about you?

3:55 4:00 FEMALE: Isn't that the largest department on campus?  I think so.  I think it's the largest department on campus.  

4:00 4:04 MALE: It's pretty damn big.  Almost like a number, you know, sometimes I feel like I'm just a number, you know.

4:05 4:11 FEMALE: Whereas at Princeton, now, you were a, uh, one of few.  [laughter]  So--I'll never get over the fact that Princeton um didn't accept me, so--

4:11 4:12 MALE: I'm sorry.

4:12 4:13 FEMALE: Yeah.  I had to go to Yale, it's really sad, right.

4:13 4:14 MALE: Oh yeah, really [laughter].

4:15 4:17 FEMALE: Just simply terrible.  Yeah.  Simply terrible.  I'm in MS and E.

4:17 4:18 MALE: Okay.   

4:17 4:20 FEMALE: so I'm definitely one of a number too.

4:19 4:20 MALE: Nice.  Are you doing a master's?

4:20 4:24 FEMALE: Yeah.  How many more years?  You got, like, many?

4:24 4:27 MALE: The age old question.  I don't know how many PhD students you've asked that, but, like--

4:28 4:35 FEMALE: No, that's not true.  Most people are, like, they assume the best, you know?  They assume they're going to be out in five years, so they just say three [horn] or two.

4:35 4:37 MALE: Yeah.  If only it really happened that way.

4:37 4:40 FEMALE: You, you'll be out soon.  You're from Princeton.  You'll be fine.

4:39 4:41 MALE: Oh that's right.  Good to meet you.

4:40 4:41 FEMALE: [unintelligible].

4:40 4:41 MALE: female230.

4:41 4:42 FEMALE: [laughter].

4:42 4:43 MALE: There we go.
