0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  No it's --  

1:01 1:03 MALE:  They jam it into your head and throw you out.  

1:01 1:04 FEMALE:  They really do.  I hope it stays in there because [laughter].  

1:06 1:08 MALE:  It's like an assembly line, you're going through and there you go, that's yours.  

1:06 1:14 FEMALE:  Kind of, it feels like that.  No, I'm like, am I supposed to be skillful after this, I hope so [laughter].   So [unintelligible], yeah I have the real world coming upon me very soon as well.  

1:17 1:20 MALE:  So you're planning to work after this or --  

1:18 1:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, no I'm going to work.  I think I'm going to move to New York, you know, just do the New York thing for a couple of years and then see whether I want to go back to school or not.  

1:30 1:32 MALE:  And what sort of work would you be doing?  

1:31 1:53 FEMALE:  Well it's very flexible.  So, but what I'd like to do, I'd like to work for maybe a children's television show.  But if that not, like it's pretty, I mean like youth and nonprofit or if I wanted to work in a charter school and if -- I'm not a teacher, but I mean [unintelligible] a research skills or anything like that I suppose I can do, but I figure New York is a big place, there's a lot of stuff, so I figure I should work [unintelligible].  

1:55 2:02 MALE:  Yeah I mean if you don't find something in New York, like unless you're in the -- I mean if you're a computer scientist, then you need to be here.  

2:00 2:01 FEMALE:  Then here would be better right.  

2:03 2:05 MALE:  Otherwise, you know, New York has everything.  

2:04 2:07  FEMALE:  Yeah that's what I'm hoping.  So we'll see, we'll see. And so -- 

2:10 2:11 MALE:  So you're still looking for things?  

2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  No I haven't started yet.
