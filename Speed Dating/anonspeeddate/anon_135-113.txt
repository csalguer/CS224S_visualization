0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  I've got the long haul.  
0:41 0:49 MALE:  Oh, my gosh.  One of my roommates he's a first year.  It's so funny  because like his perspective is completely different.  It's like he's all wide-eyed and like eager.  
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:50 1:00 MALE:  To try everything and like he wants t know where all the good places to go are and stuff.  And I'm like, you know, laid back and kind of like cynical.  And like I've been here.  
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: Seen it.  
1:01 1:15 MALE:  I'm ready to go.  I want to try like going to a company maybe.  You know, I've been in a university environment for so long.  Did you come straight from undergrad or have you worked for a while?  
1:13 1:16 FEMALE:  No, I've worked for [unintelligible] a little bit, and then I got a Master's in Wisconsin.  
1:19 1:19 MALE:  Okay.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  And worked there.  So...
1:20 1:22 MALE:  Did you like it over there?  
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:24 1:24 MALE:  I don't know many midwesterners.  
1:23 1:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, it is different.  It was really weird, you know.  Like it's very, uhm, like not your burbs, and like people, I don't know, they're very like stick to themselves.  
1:39 1:39 MALE:  okay.  
1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  So.  
1:41 1:42 MALE:  So, it's very different from the California kind of like--
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Total, yeah.  
1:44 1:45 MALE:  Okay, all right. 
1:43 1:46 FEMALE:  Like I don't know.  I really like California a lot better.  [laughter] 
1:49 2:10 MALE:  Yeah, I was on the East Coast before.  So, I, uh, definitely like California a lot.  Like I was there for four--for one thing just the weather, and I think that kind of makes people crabby.  You know, crappy weather--you're just going to be in a crappy mood all the time.  Everyone always in a hurry to get to wherever they're going.  Yeah, it's completely different.  I mean I grew up in So Cal, so it was kind of a shock going to the East Coast.  
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  Was that for college?  
2:12 2:13 MALE:  Yeah, for undergrad, yeah.  
2:11 2:12 FEMALE:  Where did you go?  
2:14 2:14 MALE: I went to Princeton.  
2:12 2:17 FEMALE:  Oh, cool. I went to high school in southern California.  
2:19 2:20 MALE:  Oh, really?  
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, I went to La Piniata High School.  
2:22 2:23 MALE:  Okay, I was in Huntington Beach.  
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Oh cool.  
2:24 2:24 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:23 2:24 FEMALE:  That's pretty.  
2:26 2:38 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the city.  Yeah. Yeah.  But I don't know.  I was na"ive then.  I didn't know.  I didn't think any of that mattered if I just like, you know, yeah, I want to get far away from home.  
2:36 2:36 FEMALE:  Right.  
2:39 2:48 MALE:  But now it's like I kind of want to be closer to home, you know, and like it's kind of nice to see my parents more often.  Your parents are still, uhm--
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  [interposing]  They're actually in northern California now.  
2:51 2:54 MALE:  Okay, yeah.  So, that's probably pretty nice.  
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  They're a little too close.  
2:55 2:55 MALE:  Oh, you think so?  
2:53 2:56 FEMALE:  They're [unintelligible].  And I'm like go farther.  
2:58 2:58 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
2:57 3:01 FEMALE:  You know, farther away.  But my sister I just found out two days that I'm going to be an aunt for the first time.  
3:03 3:04 MALE:  Oh, sweet.

3:09 3:09 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:07 3:10 FEMALE:  You know, I would have been really sad if I couldn't have been here for that.
