0:03 0:03 MALE:  Take your time.

0:06 0:10 FEMALE:  Hi.  Uh, I'm female336.

0:11 0:11 MALE:  male313.

0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.

0:12 0:14 MALE:  Hi, nice to meet you.  How are things going so far?

0:15 0:15 FEMALE:  Okay.

0:16 0:16 MALE:  Yeah.

0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  Four minutes seems really quick though.

0:17 0:18 MALE:  Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

0:18 0:18 FEMALE:  [laughter].

0:19 0:20 MALE:  Although, I mean, there are two sides to that, right?

0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  I beg your pardon?

0:21 0:22 MALE:  I don't know if you've gotten anybody really bad yet.

0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Um--

0:23 0:24 MALE:  You may be happy with some guys.

0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  Oh.

0:25 0:26 MALE:  Okay.  Finally.

0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  [laughter].

0:28 0:28 MALE:  I haven't had that very often.

0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:30 0:31 MALE:  I've done this a couple of times so.

0:31 0:31 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

0:32 0:34 MALE:  Yeah.  I guess I'm getting used to the four minutes.

0:34 0:34 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:34 0:37 MALE:  But you're right, it is kind of ridiculous.  I don't know what you can really tell about a person.

0:38 0:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It seems kind of--well, just pick your--pick your finger up.

0:43 0:46 MALE:  Oh, the book of questions.  I have this book.  All right.  Let's do this one.

0:46 0:56 FEMALE:  Okay.  Would you accept a guaranteed lifetime allowance of $50,000 per year if accepting that meant you could never earn money from--oh, that's the wrong one.  Would you like to know the precise date of your death?

0:57 0:57 MALE:  Oh, crap.  [laughter].

0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

1:00 1:11 MALE:  I don't know.  I guess it kind of depends on what it is and I wouldn't want to know that until I knew.  If I was going to die soon, would I want to know that?  I don't know.

1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  Hmm.

1:12 1:17 MALE:  I think--okay.  If I was going to die soon, I wouldn't want to know.  If I was going to live a long time, I think I would.'

1:17 1:17 FEMALE:  Uh--

1:18 1:19 MALE:  That's not a good answer to the question though.

1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  Oh, [unintelligible] a little.

1:22 1:22 MALE:  What about you?

1:23 1:33 FEMALE:  I--gosh, yeah, I think I'm the same way.  Like if it were tomorrow I wouldn't want to know.  But if it were a couple of years I could--

1:32 1:33 MALE:  Some people would, I think.

1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  You think so?

1:35 1:39 MALE:  I think some people would want to like put their affairs in order or whatever.  If I'm getting hit by a bus next week--

1:39 1:39 FEMALE:  I don't want to know.

1:40 1:41 MALE:  --I'd want to worry about it for the next week you know.

1:42 1:46 FEMALE:  But if--if I knew I was going to die next week, I would do all the things I wanted to do in the next week.

1:47 1:49 MALE:  Yeah, go to Europe or something.

1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What are you studying?

1:50 1:51 MALE:  SC.

1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  SC?

1:52 1:52 MALE:  Yeah.  How about you?

1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  I'm a medical student.

1:54 1:55 MALE:  Oh, okay.  How is that?

1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  It's good.  I really like it.

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Like what year are you in?

1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  Second.  And you?

1:59 1:59 MALE:  Uh, third.

2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

2:00 2:05 MALE:  So, maybe half way through I don't know.  I'm telling everybody six years.  I don't know if that's really true.

2:05 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter].  Do you do calls already then?

2:07 2:14 MALE:  No.  I do comps, but not calls.  The comps are like the breath exams and the calls are like depth.  So, maybe I'll do them this summer or something.

2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  I beg your pardon?

2:15 2:16 MALE:  I might do them this summer or something.

2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  Okay.  

2:17 2:20 MALE:  I don't know.  What about you?  What do you guys have as--do you have calls, do you have--

2:20 2:24 FEMALE:  Um, we--we have, uh, national board, like, licensing exams that are--

2:24 2:25 MALE:  Is that just at the end?

2:25 2:26 FEMALE:  It's--no, it's three times.

2:27 2:27 MALE:  Oh, wow.

2:27 2:30 FEMALE:  Once after second year, which is right--like in a month for me, um--

2:30 2:31 MALE:  Are you frickin mad about it?

2:33 2:36 FEMALE:  Kind of, I mean, if I really were I wouldn't be here, so, yeah.

2:37 2:38 MALE:  Yeah.  Will you be freaking out in a month?

2:39 2:39 FEMALE:  Yes.

2:40 2:40 MALE:  Okay.

2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  [laughter].

2:43 2:45 MALE:  Yeah.  Is it a weed out thing, I mean, do people fail it?

2:45 2:53 FEMALE:  People do, I think it's like only 10 percent, but then like doing well enough to hopefully do whatever specialty that you want.

2:53 2:56 MALE:  So, that--the scores matter?  I see.  What specialty do you want?

2:57 3:02 FEMALE:  I don't know yet.  So, that's kind of why I'm nervous about it.  Because if I wanted to do something less competitive I wouldn't worry so much about it.

3:02 3:04 MALE:  Okay.  It's probably good to, you know, [unintelligible] on the side of--yeah.

3:04 3:05 FEMALE:  Try your best, yeah.

3:05 3:06 MALE:  Yeah, a more competitive field.

3:06 3:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What do you like to do in your spare time?

3:09 3:25 MALE:  Speed dating, no.  I don't know.  Um, what do I like to do.  I'm in quiz ball, which is like the buzzard trivia team.  Like I just came from there actually.  They're having [unintelligible] tonight.  So, I [unintelligible] of that and then ran over here.  Read, it's kind of boring, I guess.  [unintelligible].  I don't know.  What about you? 

3:25 3:29 FEMALE:  Um, I like to stay active.  I'm taking a wind surfing class this quarter.

3:29 3:30 MALE:  Wow. 

3:30 3:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And I love it.

3:31 3:32 MALE:  Is it in the Bay or the ocean or how does that work?

3:32 3:38 FEMALE:  It's on a lake.  It's on Yuba Lake.  And I'm on a soccer team that plays every Sunday.  A women's league.

3:38 3:43 MALE:  Cool.  Sweet.  My cousin is really into wind surfing.  He is like a nut.  I mean, he wants to move to Hawaii so he can wind surf.  

3:44 3:44 FEMALE:  Wow.

3:44 3:46 MALE:  He's kind of like seriously thinking about buying a house in Hawaii.

3:46 3:47 FEMALE:  Wow.  

3:48 3:50 MALE:  He's also from Wisconsin and he hates the winters.

3:51 3:53 FEMALE:  He--he lives in Wisconsin and he loves wind surfing?

3:53 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.

3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  Oh, that sucks.

3:55 3:59 MALE:  So, it sucks for like yeah six months a year.  Hence, the Hawaii house possibility.  I don't know.

4:00 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

4:01 4:04 MALE:  All right.  Well, good meeting.
