0:00 0:04 FEMALE:  Good timing, ha, ha.  Alright, male207?
0:04 0:05 MALE:  Good job.  With a "G".
0:05 0:08 FEMALE:  Nice, that's unique already.  I should, I should, um.
0:08 0:11 MALE:  The one "L" thing, actually, are most female239's one "l" or two?  That's a good question.
0:11 0:18 FEMALE:  You know, I've been, I wonder that too.  I've looked up my name, Googled it.  I think there's like 30 female239 female239's in the world, so, maybe it not unique.  I don't know, I mean.
0:19 0:20 MALE:  Give or take.
0:20 0:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think a, two "L's" is probably, um, more common because, you know when you're always looking for those license plate things from like, you know, little thrift stores.
0:26 0:27 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, they're mostly two "L's"?
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  Always two "L's".
0:28 0:32 MALE:  I have a friend who's female239 with two "L's" and then female239 with one "L", which I think is kind of weird, but.
0:32 0:40 FEMALE:  Hum, interesting.  I was just complain, I always telling people, my parents can't speak English, so they had to, they didn't know.  Yeah, whatever, [laughter] so, it's cool.
0:38 0:41 MALE:  Alright, well, whatever works.  So, are your parents from China?
0:42 0:46 FEMALE:  Oh, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  But I grew up in St Louis Missouri, so, I mean.  That's [laughter]...
0:47 0:48 MALE:  Okay, I was in Hong Kong in October.
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, what for?
0:49 0:51 MALE:  I have a friend that works at Asian Wall Street Journal.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Cool.
0:52 0:56 MALE:  And she, I mean I just went because I was I was like, she's only going to be there for so long, so.
0:54 0:57 FEMALE:  Nice, were you just practicing your Mandarin there?
0:58 1:00 MALE:  My Mandarin is not good.  I can't do the tones.  Tones are impossible.
1:00 1:02 FEMALE:  I know, floret, me too.
1:02 1:10 MALE:  I mean, I mean, I think you probably had a head start on it with all that.  I can't do anything.  My parents, I just, I lived with this guys who's, I mean he's American, but he speaks Chinese.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  Oh, that's true, that's true. 
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  Yep
1:10 1:20 MALE:  He's, he works on the hand, like teaching me the tones with the hand thing, and I just can't do it.  To me it's like, maybe there's a down tone, it's just like faster.  And then we got to a plateau and it's like slower, that's all I hear.
1:19 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, uh, he's got to get you really angry or something, then really practice it.
1:22 1:23 MALE:  Oh, interesting.
1:24 1:25 FEMALE:  You know, yeah, hum.
1:25 1:28 MALE:  I just think, I mean, so the question is, would it be impossible for me to learn Chinese?
1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  No, of course not, it just takes time.
1:30 1:31 MALE:  Really?
1:31 1:34 FEMALE:  It really, I, I think it would be really good.  It's just difficult, but it, it's not impossible.
1:34 1:41 MALE:  I started picking out the, like when I was in Hong Kong, I was trying to pay a lot of attention to the symbols.  And I started figuring out like that there's some patterns.
1:41 1:43 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, there are, oh yeah.  We'll get into the--
1:43 1:45 MALE:  [interposing] like, this is like the guy shows up a lot of things.
1:45 1:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy, the little water things.  yeah, there, there's a lot of little tricks to the trade.  Even I don't know it that well though.  I mean, I grew up in Missouri, there's not much Asian influence there, so.
1:55 1:57 MALE:  Okay.  You say Missouri though, not Missoura [phonetic]?
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, Missouri is for people from St Louis.

2:14 2:15 MALE:  You don't seem like a country person.
2:15 2:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, no, I don't really know what kind of person I am.  I've been all across the country though.  I, I um went to school in Boston and then I--
