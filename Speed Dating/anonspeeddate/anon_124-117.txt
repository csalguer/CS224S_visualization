0:26 0:30 FEMALE:  Um, I'm here quality [unintelligible].
0:24 0:24 MALE:  Okay.
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  I've been at[unintelligible].  I've been through [unintelligible].
0:30 0:34 MALE:  [unintelligible]?  [unintelligible] getting the PhD, or did you go to undergrad?
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  I went [unintelligible].
0:35 0:38 MALE:  Okay.  Oh so this is your first year--oh you're getting master's, is [unintelligible].  Okay.
0:45 0:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] five years.
0:45 0:45 MALE:  That's kind of good.
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:47 0:47 MALE:  Yeah.
0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:48 0:52 MALE:  Yeah.  That would have been pretty bad if you were getting your master's, and it took you five years so far [laughter].
0:58 1:00 FEMALE:  No.  That would not have been good [unintelligible].
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Yeah [laughter].  [unintelligible].
1:03 1:05 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:00 1:00 MALE:  I'm in the law school.
1:07 1:08 FEMALE:  Okay.  How do you like it?
1:03 1:07 MALE:  I like it.  I mean, I think it's really interesting.  I was actually in education before, so.
1:14 1:16 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] what [unintelligible]?
1:10 1:22 MALE:  Well I was a teacher, and then I well--I was--I taught elementary school.  And so while I was teaching, I was taking courses to become an administrator.  And I was like, okay, I don't want to be a principal or a teacher really.
1:29 1:32 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:26 1:38 MALE:  Well I actually wanted to do education law because it was, you know, I was a teacher and you just see, like all these people making policy decisions.  I was deciding between law and PhD in education.
1:45 1:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:40 1:42 MALE:  And I just decided law was more flexible.
1:49 1:57 FEMALE:  I'm going [unintelligible] point right now.  I really want to go to [unintelligible] hopefully [unintelligible].
1:51 1:53 MALE:  Yeah. I worked--I've worked with them.
1:59 2:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] But I'm just not sure like how [unintelligible].  I'm trying to decide how [unintelligible] would be.  [unintelligible].
2:04 2:04 MALE:  Yeah.
2:12 2:20 FEMALE:  But at what point [unintelligible].
2:14 2:17 MALE:  Well I worked on this case.  Have you heard about the Williams case at all?
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:18 2:43 MALE:  Yeah.  So I mean, I worked on that at my first summer of law school.  And then, last summer, I was going to work for a law firm that was working on it pro bono, and they settled.  So uh, but you know, they didn't get as much, obviously, as they would have liked, but the lawsuit did make some fairly substantial changes, which I don't know that those things would have changed without the law suit.  So--
2:50 2:55 FEMALE:  My guess [unintelligible].
2:48 2:48 MALE:  Yeah.
2:56 2:58 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] and how you want [unintelligible].
2:52 2:52 MALE:  Yeah.
2:59 3:00 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:54 2:59 MALE:  Yeah.  It's hard.  It's definitely a messy thing, you know.  It's not like simple, but--
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:00 3:02 MALE:  You hope that [laughter] you know, it made some difference.
3:09 3:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:04 3:04 MALE:  So.
3:10 3:10 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:06 3:06 MALE:  Yeah.
3:13 3:13 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:08 3:12 MALE:  Yeah.  I mean, education is always going to be something that I'm focused on.
3:18 3:21 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:15 3:15 MALE:  From Chicago.
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:19 3:19 MALE:  Really?
3:25 3:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:20 3:24  MALE:  Oh that's weird.  'Cause we just--we all want to come out to California.
3:30 3:31 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:26 3:26 MALE:  Oh okay.
3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:28 3:28 MALE:  Yeah.
3:35 3:38 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] are you [unintelligible]?
3:32 3:56 MALE: Oh you know, I was thinking this semester has been so crazy, I don't feel like I've done that much, because I've been out of town so much.  But I obviously go to movies, go hiking, [unintelligible] type of weather.  Um, I've gone to that Rancho San Antonio, like you can do like little stuff, and then, I've gone to Tahoe.  But.
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:58 3:58 MALE:  Yeah.  It was--
4:05 4:05 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
4:00 4:00 MALE:  You too.
4:06 4:06 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
4:01 4:03 MALE:  Thanks a lot.  You too.
