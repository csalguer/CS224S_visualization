0:00 0:02 MALE: Got it down, huh?

0:03 0:04 FEMALE: Get a pattern.

0:04 0:05 MALE: Yeah.  Real, I know.  [horn] 

0:05 0:06 FEMALE: God it's a horrible noise.

0:06 0:07 MALE: I'm male219.

0:07 0:09 FEMALE: How are you?  I'm female231.

0:07 0:08 MALE: Hi, how are you.

0:10 0:13 FEMALE: It's a pleasure to meet you.  male219, you are a business student?

0:08 0:09 MALE: No, the other one.

0:15 0:16 FEMALE: Law student?

0:10 0:11 MALE: No.

0:16 0:17 FEMALE: The other one, engineering?

0:11 0:12 MALE: Yeah.  

0:17 0:18 FEMALE: Okay.  

0:12 0:14 MALE: Exactly.  I thought you were going to get it the first guess.

0:20 0:27 FEMALE: Well engineering--you threw me when you said the other one, 'cause engineering's usually my second guess, because, you know, most people are engineers at Stanford.

0:21 0:22 MALE: That's what I--that's what I was--

0:29 0:30 FEMALE: But when you said the other one, I thought it was something other than engineering.  I don't know why.

0:24 0:26 MALE: Okay.  Okay.  

0:32 0:33 FEMALE: But anyway, so uh--

0:27 0:28 MALE: Well where are you from?

0:35 0:36 FEMALE: I grew up in Texas.

0:30 0:31 MALE: Uh are you a nameX Bush fan?

0:37 0:44 FEMALE: Am I a nameX Bush fan?  [laughter]  Um no, I would not say I'm a nameX Bush fan.  Uh although I did meet him when he was--the second one, right?  nameX W?

0:38 0:39 MALE: Right.  Right.  

0:45 0:50 FEMALE: Is that who you're talking about?  I met him when he was governor.  Um and he was sort of interesting to talk to.  I went to the University of Texas undergrad.

0:43 0:44 MALE: Okay.  

0:50 0:54 FEMALE: And I was in a class that met over at the legislature, and so he came and talked to our class one day.

0:48 0:50 MALE: Did he--continue, I'm interested.

0:56 0:59 FEMALE: Well so he could, actually, like, he didn't--I mean, he didn't look like an idiot.

0:53 0:54 MALE: No.

1:00 1:01 FEMALE: I don't know whether or not you like him.

0:55 0:56 MALE: No I've heard, no, I've heard this--I don't know where I heard this--

1:02 1:08 FEMALE: He was pretty good, you know, personally.  I mean, like, you, you talk to him, and you feel like the man loves you.  You feel like he's your best friend.

1:02 1:03 MALE: Right.  Right.  

1:09 1:13 FEMALE: Yeah, he's really quite good with small groups or, like, interacting with individuals.  Um, it's just when you get him on TV that he's not very good.

1:08 1:13 MALE: But you know I've read somewhere where he actually changed the way he talked in the last, like, 20 years.

1:19 1:20 FEMALE: Oh that's interesting.

1:14 1:15 MALE: I don't know if that's true.

1:21 1:22 FEMALE: I don't know because I've only ever talked to him within the last 20 years.

1:17 1:18 MALE: Right.  

1:23 1:31 FEMALE: He definitely has more of an accent now than he did when we talked to him when he was governor.  I think people from Texas--I mean, whatever.  I'm a sixth generation Dallasite.  Can you hear an accent?

1:25 1:26 MALE: No, not really.

1:32 1:33 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:27 1:28 MALE: No.

1:33 1:35 FEMALE: I guarantee he did not grow up with an accent.  So--

1:30 1:32 MALE: He does actually have, has a quite large accent now.

1:39 1:40 FEMALE: Yeah.  He, I think he affects it.

1:34 1:35 MALE: Okay.  

1:40 1:44 FEMALE: And whatever, he went to school--I don't know, anyway, that's just my opinion.  So are you from Pennsylvania or--?

1:39 1:41 MALE: No.  No, no, no, no.  This is random--random--

1:46 1:47 FEMALE: Is that Penn or is that--?  Okay.  

1:41 1:42 MALE: It is Penn, though. 

1:48 1:48 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:43 1:44 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  

1:49 1:50 FEMALE: I'm like, did I get that right?

1:44 1:45 MALE: Yeah.  Good one.

1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:46 1:47 MALE: Uh no I'm from Sacramento actually.

1:53 1:54 FEMALE: Oh okay.

1:48 1:49 MALE: Uh I went to school at Berkeley.

1:55 1:56 FEMALE: Oh.

1:50 1:52 MALE: So I've been here way too long.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:52 1:54 MALE: So how do you like the weather in uh, in uh--?

2:00 2:01 FEMALE: In Texas?

1:55 1:56 MALE: Yeah.  

2:01 2:02 FEMALE: It's hot.

1:56 1:57 MALE: So.

2:03 2:05 FEMALE: It's really hot in the summer.  Are you considering moving to Texas or--?

1:59 2:00 MALE: I'm just considering moving anywhere but here.

2:06 2:12 FEMALE: Anywhere but here?  The weather--you're not--I mean, go to San Diego, I think the weather's nicer than here, but you probably know that better than I.

2:05 2:08 MALE: I'm not a big fan of San Diego weather.  I have been there though, yes.

2:14 2:15 FEMALE: What kind of weather are you looking for?

2:09 2:10 MALE: I don't know.

2:16 2:20 FEMALE: I'm sorry that we beat you out to go to the Rose Bowl, by the way.  I feel like we should get that off the table right now.

2:14 2:18 MALE: Oh man, you know what?  I didn't feel so bad about that after we lost that game.

2:24 2:25 FEMALE: To Tech?

2:19 2:20 MALE: I don't--

2:26 2:28 FEMALE: You guys went to the Holiday Bowl and you played Tech, and Tech, yeah--

2:22 2:23 MALE: Texas Tech?

2:29 2:30 FEMALE: Yeah.  It was Texas Tech.

2:24 2:25 MALE: And we got killed.

2:31 2:33 FEMALE: Yeah.  But it was the, yeah.

2:27 2:28 MALE: And you guys won, right?

2:34 2:36 FEMALE: We beat Michigan by one point in the last play of the game.

2:30 2:31 MALE: Oh.

2:36 2:37 FEMALE: It was great.

2:31 2:32 MALE: That was huge.

2:38 2:43 FEMALE: It was the best football game I've ever been to.  Was so good.  Anyway.  Sorry.  There you go [unintelligible].

2:37 2:38 MALE: Is it this way or--?

2:44 2:45 FEMALE: It's this way.

2:39 2:41 MALE: Okay.  Isn't that the devil's sign?

2:47 2:48 FEMALE: It's the devil's sign in Norway.  Did you see this?

2:43 2:46 MALE: [laughter] Well someone told me once, like, you shouldn't be doing that.

2:52 2:53 FEMALE: There was some--no, it's fine here.

2:47 2:48 MALE: Okay.  

2:54 3:00 FEMALE: There was, um, I actually went out to DC for some inaugural parties, 'cause I had been living in DC.  I can't remember whether I told you that or told--

2:54 2:55 MALE: Inaugural parties.

3:01 3:13 FEMALE: Like, during the inauguration in January.  And um there were a bunch of pictures of, like, the Bush twins and the Bush family doing this at, like, the Texas parties.  And apparently that got picked up by some newspapers in Scandinavia.

3:06 3:07 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:13 3:17 FEMALE: And they were very concerned.  I mean, seriously.  And they were like, why is the president doing a devil's sign?  And, anyway, sort of funny.

3:11 3:12 MALE: Oh so was nameX Bush doing it?

3:18 3:21 FEMALE: Yeah.  I mean he's a Longhorn fan.  It makes perfect sense.

3:15 3:16 MALE: Right.  Right.  Right.  

3:21 3:22 FEMALE: Within, like, our cultural context.

3:17 3:18 MALE: Right.  

3:23 3:25 FEMALE: But maybe not in their cultural context, so.

3:20 3:25 MALE: We'll declare war on America because of their beliefs.  So um what do you like to do for fun?

3:31 3:33 FEMALE: What do I like to do for fun?  I go to movies.

3:27 3:28 MALE: Have you seen anything good?

3:34 3:36 FEMALE: I saw The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on Friday.

3:30 3:31 MALE: Is it good?

3:37 3:38 FEMALE: It is.

3:31 3:32 MALE: Okay.  

3:38 3:39 FEMALE: It's worth seeing.

3:32 3:33 MALE: Is it like the book?

3:39 3:44 FEMALE: Um well it's a good question.  I don't know that I can answer that.  I read the book probably 15 years ago.

3:37 3:38 MALE: Me too, me too.

3:44 3:46 FEMALE: Which I think is a good time to have read it, because--

3:40 3:41 MALE: Okay.  

3:46 3:48 FEMALE: You probably remember things like the answer is 42.

3:42 3:43 MALE: 42.

3:49 3:50 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:43 3:44 MALE: Yeah.  

3:50 3:55 FEMALE: So if you know that much you'll appreciate that the movie sort of keeps true to the big things, but you won't sit there and pick apart whether or not it's like--

3:49 3:50 MALE: Small whether it was like--

3:56 3:57 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:51 3:54 MALE: Oh he didn't drive that space car or something.

3:59 4:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  Right.  

3:54 3:55 MALE: Okay.  

4:01 4:02 FEMALE: And the--I mean, the actors were great.  

3:56 3:57 MALE: Okay.  

4:02 4:08 FEMALE: The casting is done really well.  I went with, um, I have some friends from undergrad who lives in--[horn] who live in San Francisco, and we went in bathrobes, which I highly recommend.

4:02 4:03 MALE: Bathrobes.

4:09 4:10 FEMALE: Makes it better.

4:04 4:05 MALE: I don't get it.

4:11 4:13 FEMALE: One of the characters wears a bathrobe through the entire thing.

4:07 4:08 MALE: Oh okay.

4:14 4:15 FEMALE: So anyway.

4:09 4:10 MALE: I'll get that ticket.  All right.  

4:16 4:17 FEMALE: Okay.  Pleasure meeting you.

4:11 4:12 MALE: Take care.
