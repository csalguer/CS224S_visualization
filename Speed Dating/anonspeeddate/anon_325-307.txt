0:10 0:11 MALE: How's it going?
0:02 0:05 FEMALE: It's going well. It's good. It feels long just because there's so many people.
0:20 0:23 MALE: What school are you in? Why are we whispering? Oh. We're not supposed to talk yet.
0:13 0:23 FEMALE: I don't know. It's because we're cheating. But I graduated in 2001, I'm a CS major. How about you?
0:33 0:44 MALE: I'm in the business school. [horn] Now we can talk. I'm in the Business School. I have three more weeks left.
0:35 0:37 FEMALE: Yea. Congratulations, that's awesome.
0:46 0:48 MALE: It's more sad than exciting.
0:40 0:40 FEMALE: You have to get a job now?
0:51 0:58 MALE: Yeah. But I'm working on a business plan so hopefully I'll be starting my own business which will be cool.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE: What kind of thing? Or I guess I should not ask you.
1:02 1:06 MALE: What's that? That's okay, I've been talking about it a lot. It's in the health and wellness space.
0:56 0:58 FEMALE: That's awesome. Let's talk about something else. What do you do for fun?
1:07 1:16 MALE: Thank you. You saved me. For fun I work out and I run and swim. I do triathlons.
1:07 1:07 FEMALE: What?
1:17 1:18 MALE: Triathlons.	
1:08 1:08 FEMALE: That's awesome.
1:19 1:21 MALE: So we just had a big one two weekends ago.
1:15 1:15  FEMALE: Is that Alcatraz?
1:24 1:43 MALE: No. It's coming up. It's called Wildflower, it's down in [unintelligible]. I had a lot of fun. So a couple of months of training for it and then it ended. So last weekend we just partied our brains out. Like all right, we're done training so now we can actually enjoy and have some fun.
1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Yeah. I like to run but I'm not so good at the biking part.
1:46 1:47 MALE: Yeah. Do you fall over?
1:38 1:40 FEMALE: Fall over. I actually never learned how to ride a bike.
1:49 1:52 MALE: Oh really? Aaw, you should learn, it's fun.	
1:43 1:46 FEMALE: I like the idea of getting to places fast so biking might work.
1:55 1:56 MALE: Where did you grow up?
1:48 1:51 FEMALE: I grew up in Hong Kong, which explains the biking part. And then--
2:00 2:02 MALE: So that's why you didn't learn how to ride a bike?
1:54 1:56 FEMALE: Yeah. But I've been here for about 12 years now. 
2:07 2:08 MALE: What brought you over here? Family?
1:59 2:05 FEMALE: Just the handover. Hong Kong, British handover to China. Generally we don't want to be there when that happens.
2:15 2:21 MALE: Got you. Interesting. That's cool. So you went to Stanford undergrad?
2:13 2:14 FEMALE: Yeah. And then I finished up with a co-term.
2:27 2:28 MALE: And now you're still here?
2:19 2:22 FEMALE: I'm not. I'm actually working. I'm just here. I was brought here.
2:34 2:36 MALE: Got it. I was like wait, I missed something, how are you...? Okay. Got it.
2:28 2:28 FEMALE: I'm not here anymore.
2:42 2:43 MALE: Got it. That's cool. Are you living in the area?
2:31 2:32 FEMALE: I live in Los Altos.
2:44 2:45 MALE: That's easy.
2:33 2:35 FEMALE: That's very easy. Do you live in the city?
2:48 2:48 MALE: How do you like living down there?
2:39 2:42 FEMALE: It's good, I like it. It's quiet if you want it to be quiet. If you want some noise then you go up to the city so.
2:52 3:06 MALE: Yeah. I'm living in [unintelligible] so it's nice to be a little bit closer to the city but it's like ten minutes closer. I feel like it makes a difference to drive a half hour instead of 40 minutes. But I miss being in the city.
2:58 2:59 FEMALE: Did you live there before?
3:10 3:11 MALE: Yeah. I was up there for two years before school and I loved it.
3:01 3:01 FEMALE: Where did you live there?
3:12 3:13 MALE: I lived in Marina and I was working over in Marens.
3:07 3:12 FEMALE: I spent a lot of time in the Sunset. I really like Golden Gate Park, it's awesome.
3:22 3:35 MALE: It's such a cool city. I like Golden Gate. When I first moved to the city I used to go to roller blade in the park. It was so cool you can start in the park and then end up on the beach. Like the first time I discovered that, oh, it's so cool.
3:22 3:27 FEMALE: Yeah. That's so awesome. Did you ever see the bison in Golden Gate Park?
3:37 3:42 MALE: I have. I think Beta Breakers usually run by there. Are you going to do Beta Breakers this Sunday?
3:31 3:34 FEMALE: And they're like, who are these people? You know the troops and troops of people?
3:44 3:50 MALE: It's a good stampede of people, it's ironic. Are you going to do Beta Breakers?
3:40 3:49 FEMALE: I don't know. I'll think about it. It's more the early in the morning thing than the running thing. Just the thousands and thousands of people.
3:58 4:08 MALE: I think it's so entertaining, it's such a unique event. I'll probably just stay out of the city Saturday night and do it that way. Otherwise to wake up and drive up there is such a pain.
3:58 4:04 FEMALE: I have a friend who's birthday is right around then so they make this big float. And then he sits there and drinks beer and people push him up the hill. It's very funny.
4:14 4:14 MALE: Like a float?
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: Yeah. For my friend.
4:15 4:15 MALE: What kind of float?
4:07 4:07 FEMALE: It's just like a plywood platform thing and then he has a keg up there.
4:19 4:39 MALE: That's cool. Yeah. Last year my friends pushed a shopping cart with a keg and stop and do case tens every ten feet. I think we were last when we did it last year. It took us like 12 hours or something ridiculous like that. We would go two steps and [horn]
4:28 4:29 FEMALE: Yeah. I can't get up the hill. All right.
4:43 4:44 MALE: Good talking to you.
4:34 4:34 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, male307.
4:45 4:45 MALE: Yeah.	
4:35 4:35 FEMALE: Take care.
