0:01 0:01 MALE: Sorry.
0:02 0:04 FEMALE: No it's okay.  They haven't sounded the horn yet.
0:04 0:05 MALE: I'm so conditioned to it, I--
0:08 0:08 FEMALE: I know.
0:06 0:07 MALE: --don't even notice anymore.
0:21 0:23 FEMALE: [laughter] It's okay.  Take your time.
0:23 0:24 MALE: Okay.  [unintelligible].  Um, okay.
0:26 0:26 FEMALE: Yes.
0:24 0:25 MALE: So what are you studying?
0:28 0:28 FEMALE: Uh, material science.
0:27 0:28 MALE: Are you, in your master's or PhD?
0:31 0:31 FEMALE: Master's.
0:30 0:34 MALE: Second year law student.  Is this your first year in the master's program?
0:38 0:39 FEMALE: Um, yes, it is.  It is.
0:36 0:37 MALE: What were you doing before?
0:40 0:41 FEMALE: Um, I was an undergrad [laughter].
0:39 0:39 MALE: Here?
0:43 0:43 FEMALE: Um, at MIT.
0:40 0:41 MALE: Oh. Okay.
0:44 0:44 FEMALE: So.

0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Oh yeah, yeah.
0:46 0:50 MALE: You find a lot of--I don't know if you notice, there's a lot of people come here for undergrad, totally fall in love with it, and never want to leave.
0:54 0:55 FEMALE: Well I grew up here.
0:53 0:53 MALE: Oh you--
0:56 0:56 FEMALE: And then I went away.  And I was like--
0:53 0:53 MALE: --needed to leave.
0:56 0:57 FEMALE: I must come back [laughter].
0:55 0:56 MALE: How are you finding it, compared to MIT?
1:00 1:03 FEMALE: Um, it's nice.  It's kind of a friendlier, more open atmosphere than MIT.
1:03 1:03 MALE: What was that like?
1:06 1:08 FEMALE: Everybody asks me that.  They're like, what was that like?  It was strange [laughter].
1:06 1:12 MALE: I think the rest of us have this strange fascination with [laughter], actually Harvard and MIT, but particularly MIT, 'cause it's just--
1:15 1:16 FEMALE: It's like what do they do in there, you know?
1:14 1:16 MALE: --so--you know, you hear about the cars on the buildings and the--
1:19 1:19 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:16 1:17 MALE: Yeah.
1:20 1:21 FEMALE: [unintelligible].
1:18 1:19 MALE: The cow also on the building?
1:22 1:23 FEMALE: Yes.  They had a cow in the building.
1:20 1:21 MALE: A real cow or a, uh--
1:24 1:24 FEMALE: A real cow.
1:22 1:24 MALE: 'Cause I remember the police car was supposed to be just a shell.
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: [unintelligible] police car too.
1:24 1:27 MALE: This was--well wow.  That's impressive.
1:30 1:31 FEMALE: Yeah, they had a [unintelligible].  Yeah.   That's what I thought.  I'll--
1:28 1:28 MALE: Did you get in on this?
1:32 1:32 FEMALE: No.
1:29 1:30 MALE: Are you sworn to secrecy?  Okay.
1:33 1:33 FEMALE: No, no, no [laughter].  But it was intense, like [unintelligible].
1:34 1:39 MALE: And we got the video last year of, um, the football game prank, with the--
1:42 1:42 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].
1:40 1:43 MALE: I don't remember who the other team was.  But well done, I must say.
1:46 1:46 FEMALE: It was probably Harvard.
1:44 1:45 MALE: Well deserved, I'll say [laughter].
1:49 1:50 FEMALE: It's kind of like, oh [laughter].
1:47 1:51 MALE: So I mean, are you--is it pretty social in your department?  Have you like met a lot of people?
1:55 2:05 FEMALE: Um, not so much.  It's kind of a smaller department.  I mean, we kind of hang out with my study group and stuff.  Um, other people hang out with their laboratory groups.  But I'm not actually in one, since I'm in master's.  So, um, but--
2:02 2:05 MALE: What are you doing within--I'm kind of ignorant about material science.  
2:09 2:09 FEMALE: It's kind of new.
2:07 2:09 MALE: What's your area of focus?
2:12 2:18 FEMALE: Um, I'm kind of really like into solar cells, um building those, and kind of clean technology fuel cells, things like that.  So.
2:15 2:17 MALE: And what comes next?  Going into industry or?
2:21 2:21 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:18 2:19 MALE: Is it to early to say?
2:22 2:25 FEMALE: Well actually I interviewed at Google this morning for a marketing position.
2:23 2:26 MALE: Oh no [laughter].  I did product marketing and management for Microsoft--
2:30 2:30 FEMALE: Oh really?
2:27 2:28 MALE: --before, so similar kind of, yeah.
2:30 2:31 FEMALE: Yeah.  Did you enjoy that?
2:29 2:34 MALE: I loved it.  It was, I mean, an amazing job.  I just decided that law was what I was really passionate about, so.
2:37 2:38 FEMALE: Oh that's important too.
2:35 2:41 MALE: But um, that's very cool.  Well uh, I've heard so many amazing things about the company.
2:44 2:44 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:42 2:43 MALE: Do you feel that it went pretty well?
2:46 2:52 FEMALE: I think so.  It was the second interview.  So obviously the first one went okay.  And then, this one seemed to have gone pretty well, too.
2:50 2:51 MALE: How many more interviews are there?
2:54 2:57 FEMALE: A lot.  A lot.  I think this guy was like warning me, 'cause it's like--
2:55 2:56 MALE: How many people did you meet with in this round?
2:59 3:01 FEMALE: Uh, three.  So it was three hours long.
2:58 2:59 MALE: This is absurd.
3:02 3:02 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:00 3:00 MALE: But you know, it's totally worth it.
3:03 3:06 FEMALE: I mean, they take you to this little room, and you're like, I want to leave.
3:03 3:04 MALE: Oh and they rotate the room, but you stay there.
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].
3:05 3:12 MALE: No, no, no, no, no.  This is--they probably use the word, yeah, I've heard about the bus, the commuter bus from San Francisco with wireless inside that--
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Yes.
3:12 3:24 MALE: --former Grateful Dead chef works as a masseuse.  Actually, somebody was telling me they have some kind of mini-grocery store there with, you know, all the food that you could possibly want during the working hours.
3:27 3:27 FEMALE: Yeah, they do.
3:25 3:26 MALE: I don't think he spends any money on groceries.
3:30 3:33 FEMALE: And the cafeteria smelled awesome, 'cause I left around lunch time.
3:30 3:31 MALE: They didn't invite you to lunch?
3:34 3:34 FEMALE: No [laughter].
3:32 3:36 MALE: Who are these strange people who work in this magical place.
3:39 3:40 FEMALE: Well after three and a half hours, I was like, I need to leave.
3:38 3:38 MALE: You were pretty eager to get out of there.
3:41 3:42 FEMALE: But, yeah.
3:39 3:46 MALE: So what happened with that--I mean, do you--were you thinking one time about kind of working in the field of solar research, and then just decided--
3:49 3:52 FEMALE: Um, yeah.  I mean, I [unintelligible] of kind of summer jobs and part time work through the year.
3:50 3:52 MALE: And ended up deciding more like, [unintelligible] in sure in marketing was your-- 
3:55 4:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  I think it's just I miss the human contact [laughter].  I was like, please talk to me, people.  Talk to me [laughter].
3:57 3:59 MALE: Okay.  That totally makes sense [laughter].  That's cool.
4:03 4:04 FEMALE: [unintelligible].
4:02 4:04 MALE: So would this be for a summer gig, or full time like after--
4:07 4:07 FEMALE: It's a full time.
4:04 4:06 MALE: Are you done now?  Or do you have another year to go?
4:09 4:11 FEMALE: Uh, no.  I've got another two quarters, um, after this one.
4:09 4:10 MALE: [unintelligible] just kick it after that.
4:14 4:14 FEMALE: Yeah.  Or something.
4:14 4:17 MALE: I think that's cool.  Although solar cells sounded pretty sweet as well.  
4:19 4:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's very cool, too, so.
4:17 4:21 MALE: You can do that on the side.  No.  It was really good to meet you, female326.
4:24 4:24 FEMALE: Yeah, you too.
4:21 4:22 MALE: Take care.
