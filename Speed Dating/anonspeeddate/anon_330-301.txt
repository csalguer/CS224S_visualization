00:03 00:04 FEMALE: Those horns freak me out.  
00:01 00:02 MALE: I know.  It's tough, right?  
00:06 00:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  
00:03 00:03 MALE: Like a quiz.
00:07 00:13 FEMALE: They could have, like, um, I don't know, a bell or something.  Something a little more friendly to the ear.  
00:09 00:09 MALE: It's crazy.    
00:13 00:17 FEMALE: I know.  It's, like, go, go, go.  It's very competitive.  Hi, I'm female330.  
00:14 00:14 MALE: I'm male301.  Good to meet you.  
00:19 00:19 FEMALE: So what's up?  
00:17 00:21 MALE: Not too much.  I had my two friends at the beginning of the, uh, at the beginning of the time and then I had a break afterwards.  
00:25 00:25 FEMALE: I--
00:22 00:26 MALE: So I'm just kind of, I'm in the middle.  I know you're kind of, you know, halfway through, but I'm just kind of getting started.  
00:30 00:33 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  So, but you weren't done with your friends, but you think --
00:30 00:33 MALE: Exactly.  How to, yeah, how to get them loose, get them talking.
00:37 01:00 FEMALE: It is kind of a strange environment.  [unintelligible]  Well, I--I guess I must say that I'm here because my, um, professor is organizing this event so it's a different kind of outlook that I'm having when I talk to people and it's--I have [unintelligible] four really different people.  They're very different, like, perspective on stuff and approach to taking these events, you know, less or more seriously.    
00:57 00:57 MALE: Yeah.  
01:01 01:01 FEMALE: It's very interesting.  
00:58 01:02 MALE: It's really funny, right?  You're a student of [unintelligible] nameX, then?
01:06 01:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  Are you?  
01:04 01:05 MALE: No, I'm in a STEP program, actually.  
01:09 01:10 FEMALE: Out here?  
01:08 01:10 MALE: So where you from originally?  You decided to come out here? 
01:14 01:17 FEMALE: Um, I was born in Korea and raised in Argentina.
01:15 01:15 MALE: Oh, wow.
01:19 01:19 FEMALE: In Buenos Aires.  
01:16 01:18 MALE: You're all, from all over the place. That's great.  
01:21 01:27 FEMALE: Yeah, a little bit.  And then I was in Boston, actually, for a long time, for five years.  Um...
01:24 01:25 MALE: Is that where you did [unintelligible] college or?  
01:29 01:31 FEMALE: College and masters and then now I'm doing a Ph.D.  
01:29 01:30 MALE: How long is your Ph.D. program?  
01:35 01:39 FEMALE: You know, that's a question that you should never ask a person--they never taught you this?  
01:35 01:36 MALE: [unintelligible]
01:41 01:44 FEMALE: [laughter].  Um, I'm a second year and I probably have three or four years to go.  
01:42 01:51 MALE: Well, I mean, you can give a general idea.  Some doctoral programs are, like, three years.  Some are like ten years, you know.  So that's good to know, you know, it's like four or five.  
01:54 02:04 FEMALE: I'm hoping it's closer to three than ten, but you're right.  One never knows.  I don't think I will actually last ten years.  I mean if I have to go more than five I think I'll just...
02:03 02:09 MALE: It depends.  I mean, like, yeah, if you're at five years and you can see the end, maybe you can stick with it but like, uh, if you think you're going to be another five years [unintelligible].  
02:12 02:15 FEMALE: Yeah.  What, so you're in education, is that...
02:12 02:14 MALE: Yeah, I'm in the teacher education program.  
02:17 02:17 FEMALE: Okay.  So you're a teacher?  
02:15 02:18 MALE: I teach up in San Francisco and I have classes down here.    
02:21 02:22 FEMALE: Oh, that must tough.  
02:19 02:29 MALE: Yeah, it's tough.  It's, uh, it's, they keep you busy for sure.  Like we have classes at 6 o'clock at night and then have [unintelligible].  
02:32 02:32 FEMALE: So what grades do you teach?  
02:30 02:31 MALE: I teach high school.  High school math.  
02:35 02:39 FEMALE: Isn't that the hardest, um, years to teach because they are kind of rebellious and...
02:37 03:17 MALE: I don't know.  I mean for some people it could--it's the hardest.  For me, though, I think it's--the hardest thing would be to teach, like, elementary school because the kids--hardest thing, probably the most important.  The kids are like, you can't really--they don't really know what's wrong and what's right or what's, uh, you know, like, they don't--you have to have a lot of patience with those [unintelligible].  I have a lot of patience but I don't know if I have that kind of patience, you know.  But to really say, like--like, I expect kids to be able to, like, make decisions a little bit, you know, and I feel like a high school kid, at least they kind of know if they've done something wrong and you can have a discussion about [unintelligible].  They can have more metacognitive abilities, they can kind of reflect on their own actions and they're more fun.  They get your jokes, you know, they're a little bit more adult.  You can have more of a kind of adult conversation with them.    
03:20 03:20 FEMALE: Okay.  That's good.  
03:18 03:19 MALE: So--I mean I like that.  
03:22 03:30 FEMALE: Although I hear that people in high school would know what's wrong or good, from my experience with--with your gender, I think, um--
03:27 03:28 MALE: [laughter]
03:30 03:34 FEMALE: --you don't really realize what's wrong or what's good until maybe after 35.  
03:32 03:33 MALE: Until after 35?  [laughter]
03:35 03:48 FEMALE: After a first kid they say that they finally get it, you know, because you might know things to do with your--especially if you had a daughter, that's when enlightening comes when you realize, you know, values and [unintelligible].
03:46 03:47 MALE: That's a big generalization about a whole gender, though.  
03:50 03:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  [laughter]  Maybe I've dated too many international, I don't know, French people, and they tend to be like that.  
03:56 03:57 MALE: Too many French men?
04:00 04:03 FEMALE: Yeah.  No, I'm sure a lot of Americans are the same, like French men.  
04:02 04:02 MALE: It's irresponsible.  
04:05 04:11 FEMALE: I know, I know, but...  Hey, this has been short but nice to meet you.  Good luck.  
04:08 04:11 MALE: Good to meet you.  I'll be around here.
