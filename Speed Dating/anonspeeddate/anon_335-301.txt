FILE NAME: 335_301


0:04 0:07 FEMALE: [laughter]  I'm female335.
0:01 0:02 MALE: I'm male301. 
0:08 0:09 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:03 0:07 MALE: You know, there's a great Dr. Seuss poem, actually, about, um, uh, too many Daves. It was kind of a classic.
0:13 0:14 FEMALE: Too many Daves?
0:08 0:08 MALE: Yeah.  
0:14 0:14 FEMALE: Oh.
0:09 0:12 MALE: There once was a woman name Mrs. McCave.  She had 23 sons, she named them all male301.
0:18 0:19 FEMALE: That's funny. 
0:12 0:17 MALE: And then it goes through all these other crazy names she could've named them.  But that's what my grandfather always read me when I went to bed. 
0:23 0:36 FEMALE: Aw, that's sweet.  That's funny because every time I see a male301--sometimes my friends and I talk about, um, you know in elementary school where there was, like, nameX B. and nameX L. and how it was so commonplace and that doesn't really happen anymore?
0:30 0:30 MALE: Interesting. 
0:37 0:40 FEMALE: So it's interesting to be like, "male301 C., male301 R."  Yeah. 
0:34 0:38 MALE: Huh.  I wonder why that--yeah, I wonder why that is.  Maybe 'cause you're just not in the same group as much, so you don't need to distinguish people as much. 
0:44 0:48 FEMALE: Yeah.  I think people use last names a lot more, too, you know? 
0:41 0:42 MALE: Ah.
0:49 1:06 FEMALE: Maybe, but I was telling someone earlier that it's a really important part of my identity that nobody has my name.  It's very uncommon, even in India.  But to the point where if I ever met someone with my name, I think, like, the world would end and I would just sort of freak out.  So I think that's also a bad thing, as well.
1:00 1:04 MALE: So have you--have you met a--have you been to India, and, like, you've never met another female335?
1:09 1:11 FEMALE: It's a really uncommon name in India, too. 
1:05 1:05 MALE: Really?
1:11 1:30 FEMALE: I've never met anyone who spells my name the same way as I do.  Um, there is a woman I know who spells it with Es instead of Is, but funnily enough, there is actually a girl, um, in America with the same first and last name as me, um, who I've never met, but I--
1:24 1:25 MALE: Was it, like, a Google search or something?
1:31 1:36 FEMALE: No, no, no.  She, uh--she--well, yeah.  Somebody has female335.com.  I was surprised. 
1:30 1:30 MALE: Wow.
1:36 1:43 FEMALE: But, um, she entered a science competition that I entered, like, the year after me, and I was like, "I didn't do this."  [laughter]
1:38 1:39 MALE: Oh, it was like--
1:45 1:46 FEMALE: That's how I knew.
1:40 1:41 MALE: So they thought it was the same person?
1:47 1:47 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:41 1:42 MALE: That's really funny. 
1:48 1:48 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:43 1:47 MALE: My friend, um, nameX who ended up coming to Stanford. She was a friend from high school. 
1:53 1:53 FEMALE: Okay. 
1:48 1:56 MALE: But she had, like, a similar problem where she, like, applied to a couple of schools and, like, to colleges.  And, like, one of them, they, like, mixed up her application with another nameX's application.  So they, like--
2:02 2:04 FEMALE: Wait, was she class of 2002?
1:58 1:58 MALE: She was.
2:05 2:08 FEMALE: I went here.  She was--yeah, there were two nameX that year, actually.
2:01 2:03 MALE: On the same hall.  That's right.  I think they had--they shared that story. 
2:10 2:10 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:04 2:05 MALE: That's really funny. 
2:11 2:21 FEMALE: And I still, when I talk to people--because I didn't know them that well, but--I don't know which nameX you know.  I knew one of them better than the other, but when people talk about them, I'm still never sure which one [laughter].
2:15 2:16 MALE: [laughter] Which one they're talking about
2:22 2:22 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:16 2:17 MALE: Because how can you distinguish?
2:23 2:23 FEMALE: Right. 
2:17 2:21 MALE: nameX, probably [unintelligible].  I don't know what the other one looked like.
2:28 2:41 FEMALE: My sister had two friends, nameX Li, both of them.  And so they called one of them nameX Li Rhode Island and nameX Li Virginia, which I said, "Why don't you just call one Sue and one nameX?"  But they could never, like, calibrate it and standardize it.  So--
2:34 2:37 MALE: Yeah, so, like, which one is which [unintelligible].
2:42 2:44 FEMALE: Right. Yeah.  That was probably not so good. 
2:38 2:40 MALE: That's a little bit much.  Uh, that'd be a little bit tough. 
2:45 2:45 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:41 2:45 MALE: Uh, I'm from Portland, Oregon, so it'd be the nameX from Portland, whichever one--whichever one that was. 
2:50 2:55 FEMALE: Okay.  I think that might be the one I know.  Ah, I'll go look on my Facebook later [laughter].
2:49 2:51 MALE: [laughter] [unintelligible]. 
2:57 2:58 FEMALE: So how do you like Northern California?
2:52 3:01 MALE: Uh, I like it.  Um, I mean, it's nothing compared to Oregon, that's for sure.  Like, Oregon--I--the weather, it's balmy, it's nice all the time. 
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: [laughter]
3:03 3:05 MALE: But then when it's not nice, people start to complain as soon as it starts to rain.  People complain. 
3:11 3:22 FEMALE: I like the rain when I'm going to be inside.  I like it.  Well, my favorite thing is how it rains at night.  Like, it's such a pleasant thing to wake up and hear rain, but then it's usually gone by the morning. 
3:16 3:17 MALE: Yeah, that's true.  That happens fairly often.
3:23 3:24 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:18 3:19 MALE: And it smells pretty good around here when it rains, I think. 
3:26 3:26 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:20 3:24 MALE: There's just enough, like--they do enough cultivating [unintelligible] to keep the dirt, the soil moist [unintelligible]. 
3:30 3:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  I think one of the, like, annoying things for me about Stanford is that it's not built to withstand whatever mildly bad weather it has.  Like, the fact that the bike parking is on dirt, like, constantly annoys me. 
3:35 3:36 MALE: Seriously.  Like, it's just gonna be muddy. 
3:42 3:44 FEMALE: Right.  Like, you'd think you'd know that, but [unintelligible]--
3:39 3:44 MALE: The other day, we were-- we, like, on Sunday, it just mildly--like it sprinkled all day Sunday, right, whatever?
3:50 3:51 FEMALE: Right.  Right, yeah. 
3:45 3:46 MALE: And, um--
3:52 3:54 FEMALE: Well, people were really upset about that.  I didn't mind. 
3:48 3:59 MALE: And people were really upset, and, and uh, we were playing softball out on one of the fields.  Some guy came out "When these fields are wet, you can't play on these fields."  I was like, "What?  Whatever.  You can't cancel something because it's sprinkling.  It's not going to kill us."
4:05 4:05 FEMALE: [laughter]  Yeah. 
4:00 4:01 MALE: Anyways, it was good to meet you, female335, so-- 
4:06 4:08 FEMALE: It was nice to meet you.  See ya.
