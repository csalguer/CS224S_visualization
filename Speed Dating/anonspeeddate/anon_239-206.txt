1:58 1:59 MALE:  It's midterm season, yes.
2:00 2:02 FEMALE:  My, my classes don't really have, like, midterms.
2:02 2:03 MALE:  What's your field?
2:03 2:16 FEMALE:  Uh, product design, I'm in the masters program, so.  It's uh, mostly project based and uh, yeah, there's not much, no exams or written tests or anything, which is pretty cool.
2:05 2:06 MALE:  Oh, okay. 
2:15 2:21 MALE:  That's cool, yeah, I wish I was like that.  I don't like tests anymore.  Like as an undergrad, I didn't care, you know, but now, I just hate tests.
2:22 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, did you, uh, did you take any time off between undergrad and grad?
2:26 2:27 MALE:  Oh, yeah, I took a year off.
2:27 2:29 FEMALE:  Okay, what did you do?

2:41 2:45 FEMALE:  Next year, yeah, me too.  Well what are your plans afterward?
2:46 2:50 MALE:  Um, get a job in software engineering, I guess.  How about you?  Product design?
2:51 2:56 FEMALE:  Okay.  Oh, I don't know.  It's very broad, you know.  It's like, I could do so much.
2:57 3:00 MALE:  Yeah, that's true, like, you can probably do a lot more than I can do.
3:00 3:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean there's like engineering.  Yes, I could go do what I've been doing, CAD, you know, work for a big company that makes products and--
3:04 3:05 MALE:  [interposing] CAD?
3:05 3:11 FEMALE:  Oh, Computer Aid Design.  So basically, um, I make something on the computer and send it out.  Um...
3:12 3:15 MALE:  Oh right, right, right.  Do you like the, like, program, are you happy?
3:15 3:26 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, I actually am.  It's great because it's um, its funny how my view of it has changed.  In the beginning it was like, classes I took and I was kind of annoyed because I've, feel like I've taken these classes before.
3:26 3:27 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:28 3:56 FEMALE:  But what I've gradually learned is that, its stuff that isn't taught that is really valuable.  It's like, the entre, the entrepreneurship bug that they're, they're instilling.  It's like, it's just, uh, I don't know, lots of those kinds of things, like, and maybe I'll do that.  Maybe I'll start my own company, you know, so.  Uh, it's just the positive atmosphere of doing what you want to do is what is very encouraged.  I mean, it, it's pretty impressive.
3:56 4:02 MALE:  So does like everyone in your program like, you know, like, I'm going to, you know, create something, start something?
4:02 4:06 FEMALE: Yeah, kind of, yeah.  It's just; it's pretty motivating when you're in that kind of environment.
4:07 4:10 MALE:  That's awesome.  Yeah, well, I know what you mean, like.  When I'm around people like that it's like...
4:11 4:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, like why am I not doing that?
4:13 4:14 MALE:  Exactly, like, why haven't I made in college.
4:15 4:17 FEMALE:  [laughter] sweet.  Alright.
