0:01 0:04 FEMALE:  Oh, [laughter] I'm too slow at this.  
0:05 0:05 MALE:  You're right next to the, the horn. 
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  [laughter] I'm in a really bad spot.  I'm female224.

0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you. 
0:09 0:09 MALE:  Nice to meet you too. 
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  So how's it going?  [laughter] 
0:12 0:13 MALE:  It's going fine.  
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  You're right in line for some MBAs now.  So--
0:15 0:15 MALE:  Oh am I? 
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  I'm the first of two.  
0:17 0:17 MALE:  You're an MBA?  
0:18 0:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:19 0:19 MALE:  Okay, is this like a warning, or this is just like letting me know? 
0:20 0:24 FEMALE:  No, no, no, I just looked over and I noticed that my friend nameX is right there.  So--
0:25 0:25 MALE:  Oh that's cool.  Okay. 
0:25 0:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, so, because I had before, I can't remember who, it was like five in a row of electrical engineering.  [laughter] So--
0:33 0:33 MALE:  You got another one. 
0:34 0:39 FEMALE:  Yea!  Well I just had aerospace, and I was like damn, I need another electrical engineering, and I got one.  
0:40 0:40 MALE:  Well I'm keeping your quota up.   
0:41 0:43 FEMALE:  It all worked out.  Yeah.  There's tons of you guys.  
0:44 0:44 MALE:  Yeah, there are. 
0:45 0:49 FEMALE:  [laughter] Do you do a lot of social stuff together or is it kind of everyone's decentralized. 
0:50 1:01 MALE:  We're not, we're not really a social department because like our department's never had a kegger or anything like that that I've ever known of.   Um, they don't do that stuff, so I don't really socialize with very many people in my department actually outside of work.  
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  Have you lived in Palo Alto for a while?  
1:04 1:05 MALE:  I'm in my fourth year of the PhD, so.  
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  Wow.  Had you lived in California before?  
1:08 1:09 MALE:  No. First time. 
1:10 1:10 FEMALE:  Yes? 
1:10 1:10 MALE:  No.  I haven't. 
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  No, oh.  
1:11 1:14 MALE:  I'm from Pennsylvania and I've kind of lived several, far blown places. 
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  How do you like it?  [laughter] 
1:17 1:18 MALE:  This is the nicest place I've lived.  I would say. 
1:19 1:20 FEMALE:  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  
1:21 1:21 MALE:  So you're not from here either, are you?  
1:22 1:29 FEMALE:  No, everyday my, when I, well not everyday, but when my dad calls he always makes the reference to heaven on earth, for example--
1:30 1:30 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:30 1:37 FEMALE:  --so how's the weather today in heaven on earth, or um, I get back from a trip to Jazz Fest last week, and he said so, have you arrived safely back to uh, uh, to--
1:38 1:39 MALE:  Jazz Fest?  
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  --New Orleans Jazz Fest.  
1:41 1:43 MALE:  Oh no way.  Okay, I thought Jazz Fest was going on right now.  
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  Oh really?  They just had the San Francisco Film Festival which was cool.  
1:48 1:49 MALE:  That's still going on.  Is it, wait.  
1:50 1:51 FEMALE:  It ended--what's today, it's ends on the 5th.  
1:52 1:53 MALE:  Today's the 3rd, okay.  
1:54 1:54 FEMALE:  So it ends Thursday. 
1:54 1:55 MALE:  Okay.  Have you seen anything cool there?  
1:56 2:03 FEMALE:  Um, I went to--I'm big Joan Allen fan, uh, I went to the Sundance Film Festival and saw Upside of Anger there.  And--have you seen it? 
2:04 2:04 MALE:  I haven't, no. 
2:05 2:10 FEMALE:  It's really good.  She is in it and I, I've just been--I think she's an amazing actress.  So they were doing a tribute to her--
2:11 2:11 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:11 2:17 FEMALE:  --where um, they did a Q&A, did like a film reel of clips of the movies she's been in--
2:18 2:18 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:18 2:23 FEMALE:  --and then um, showed a film of hers called--a new film called Yes. 
2:24 2:24 MALE:  It's called Yes? 
2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  Yes. [laughter] 
2:25 2:25 MALE:  Yes, all right. 
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Yes, it's called Yes.  
2:26 2:26 MALE:  Cool.
2:27 2:36 FEMALE:  Um, and unfortunately, they said that it was supposed to, like on the description of the program said it was going to last until 10:00 and then I had to drive my friend to the airport--
2:37 2:37 MALE:  Right. 
2:38 2:40 FEMALE:  --and they didn't start the movie until 9:00.
2:41 2:41 MALE:  So you basically had to miss the film.
2:41 2:45 FEMALE:  We had to leave, it was very sad.  But she was, she's a very intelligent person.  It's, it's nice to meet--
2:46 2:46 MALE:  Joan Allen? 
2:47 2:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's nice to, you know, hear from actors who are--
2:51 2:51 MALE:  So you heard her speak, but missed the film? 
2:52 2:56 FEMALE:  They did a Q&A um, in advance of the film, which was cool.  
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Nice.  
2:58 3:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And I'm going to be in L.A. for the summer doing entertainmenty stuff, so I'm excited. 
3:03 3:06 MALE:  Um, so you're, you're working the entertainment business now? 
3:07 3:15 FEMALE:  I haven't before.  I've actually done all finance stuff.  I did investment banking and then private equity, so it's a radical career shift potentially. 
3:16 3:16 MALE:  Okay, so what do you want to do?  
3:17 3:17 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:18 3:25 MALE:  Because, I don't know, I have friends who do business, and um, some of them are, some of them, their point is just, you know, everyone has to work so hard to make money--
3:26 3:26 FEMALE:  Right. 
3:27 3:27 MALE:  --since I have to, and maybe I'll retire at 40. 
3:28 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, I've been there, and I saw the people who were above me, and I didn't like the lives that they led, you know, they had buckets of money and you know, last year I made probably more money then I'll ever make in the rest of my life [laughter].  But, but it--
3:40 3:40 MALE:  So you were out working last year?  
3:41 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, so this is my first year in the program.  
3:44 3:44 MALE:  Oh cool.  
3:44 3:51 FEMALE:  But I, you know, you get to the point where you realize that, you know, at a certain point you need to have your job being sort of a reflection of what--
3:52 3:52 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:52 3:52 FEMALE:  --you value and--
3:53 4:06 MALE:  Well I mean, the way I look at is, this doesn't say, this doesn't say that much for spending too much time in the PhD program, and like spending all your time working the PhD program, but like what you do during your life is who you are, and it's what you invest. 
4:07 4:07 FEMALE:  Right. 
4:08 4:10 MALE:  I mean if you spend your whole day, your whole life crunching numbers, you turn into a number cruncher--
4:11 4:11 FEMALE:  Right. 
4:11 4:12 MALE:  --eventually. 
4:13 4:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No I agree. 
4:14 4:18 MALE:  That's why it's good that your like doing fun stuff like that, down to New Orleans, and going out to film festivals and--
4:19 4:20 FEMALE:  Well that's, that's what's great about the MBA program--
           [horn]
4:21 4:23 FEMALE:  --is that you get to do all these crazy things.  It's a lot of fun. 
4:24 4:24 MALE:  Was it school related? 
4:26 4:26 FEMALE:  Well we go with--
           [horn]
4:27 4:34 FEMALE:  --students, its' not school related, but we plan the trips together.  So we're like a very cohesive group.  Well it was nice to meet you. 
4:35 4:39 MALE:  Yeah.  Thanks.
