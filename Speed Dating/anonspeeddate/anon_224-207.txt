0:04 0:04 MALE:  Geez, you have to be right here this whole time.  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  I'm in the worst spot ever.  [laughter] 
0:06 0:07 MALE:  You're probably in the worst spot.  I'm sorry.  
0:08 0:11 FEMALE:  And I never get finished with anything, so I'm, I'm also a failure at what I'm doing.  
0:12 0:18 MALE:  I feel like, I mean its, part of the problem with the system I guess, but like, I feel it kind of becomes a blur.  
0:19 0:19 FEMALE:  It does become a blur. 
0:20 0:20 MALE:  [unintelligible]
0:20 0:27 FEMALE:  That's what I was realizing is that when I try to go back and like reflect, [laughter], it's nearly impossible.  [laughter]
0:28 0:34 MALE: And so you have the particularly tough aspect of like to keep sitting in the same place, so at least for me, like there can be some association of like, geographically--
0:35 0:35 FEMALE:  You can... exactly.  
0:35 0:35 MALE:  --or something.
0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  Exactly. But this should be easier for you, because nameX and I are like the same person.  
0:37 0:40 MALE:  Oh yeah?  Okay. 
0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  Not the same person, we're both MBA's.
0:43 0:43 MALE:  Okay. 
0:44 0:44 FEMALE:  We sort of have the same story.  
0:45 0:45 MALE:  Got it.  
0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  So you guys can use your time more productively. 
0:47 0:47 MALE:  There you go. 
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  You can be more efficient--
0:49 0:49 MALE:  [laughter] 
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  --in your uh, knowledge retrieval.  
0:52 0:56 MALE:  Okay, there I go. Fair enough.  What are--so you're almost done with the whole MBA thing?   Just starting? 
0:57 0:57 FEMALE: First year. 
0:57 0:57 MALE:  Year one-- 
0:58 0:58 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
0:58 0:58 MALE:  --of two. 
0:59 1:04 FEMALE:  Of two, yeah.  I wish it was like one of four, because it's such a ridiculous--
1:05 1:06 MALE:  Pretty soon you're going to have to go back and work again. 
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Well--
1:07 1:07 MALE:  Go work for the man.  
1:08 1:12 FEMALE:  --no, I refuse.  No I will not work for the man anymore, I've done that much too long.  
1:13 1:13 MALE:  Okay.  What next? 
1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  I'm moving on. 
1:15 1:16 MALE:  You're going to be the man next?  [laughter] 
1:17 1:26 FEMALE:  [laughter] Eventually.  Eventually, but um, uh, well I worked in finance for four years, so private equity, investment banking, et cetera, et cetera.  
1:27 1:27 MALE:  Got it, in New York?  
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  In New York.
1:28 1:28 MALE:  Of course. 
1:28 1:31 FEMALE:  Exactly, and now I want to transition into like entertainment. 
1:32 1:32 MALE:  Okay. 
1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  To try to--the business side.  Um--
1:36 1:36 MALE:  So would that be like down in L.A.?  
1:37 1:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So I'm working, I've never been in, I've never spent time in L.A. before, uh, so this is the big test--
1:43 1:43 MALE:  Okay.  
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  --to see if I can hack it.  Um, so I'll be in L.A. for the summer.  And we'll see. 
1:48 1:49 MALE:  You're an East Coaster? 
1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  No, I'm a Midwesterner. 
1:51 1:51 MALE:  Really? 
1:52 1:52 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:53 1:54 MALE:  Hmm.  I'm trying to work on the picking up accent thing.  I guess it's not going to--  
1:55 1:59 FEMALE:  No, well see that's the thing, is like Midwest is like no accent, and I don't think I have any accent at all.  
2:00 2:02 MALE:  And so you're like the Ohio, Indiana Midwest, not the Minnesota, Wisconsin?   
2:03 2:06 FEMALE:  Right, exactly, exactly, although it's like the Great Plains states.  
2:07 2:08 MALE:  So what state are you actually from?  
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  Kansas. 
2:09 2:11 MALE:  Ooh Kansas.  Kansas counts as Midwest? 
2:12 2:12 FEMALE:  What else would it be?  
2:13 2:13 MALE:  I don't know. 
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  It's the Great Plains; it's the middle of the country.  [laughter] 
2:15 2:17 MALE:  Yeah, you're right.  You're right. 
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  What about you?  What's your story?  
2:20 2:26 MALE:  Um, I'm from Virginia, um, near D.C.  I'm in electrical engineering.  Just to go through the standard stuff, yeah.   
2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  You have a many of your brethren here tonight.  
2:29 2:30 MALE:  It's amazing, isn't it?  Its like--
2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  [laughter] Do you know these people? 
2:32 2:40 MALE:  No, no, no, there's tons of us.  But it's a tough situation because, like first of all, you know that the ratio in engineering is really bad.  So like you can actually--
2:41 2:42 FEMALE:  I can't imagine what the PhD programs like.  
2:43 2:44 MALE:  Yeah.  So we naturally get drawn to things like this.  
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:46 2:54 MALE:  I mean there's so many of us, that like, it's hard because I don't want to, I'm kind of struggling with the idea of like, when I tell people, there's going to be like this, all this stereotype, right?  
2:55 2:55 FEMALE:  Right. 
2:56 2:59 MALE:  But like, I don't know, I want to be proud of it.  So you know.  I wan to like, I mean it's my thing.  [laughter] 
3:00 3:02 FEMALE:  [laughter] You did undergrad in Virginia as well? 
3:03 3:04 MALE:  No, I went to Princeton.  
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  There's a lot of Princeton people at um--
3:06 3:06 MALE:  At Stanford. 
3:07 3:09 FEMALE:  --at Stanford, I mean at, like the GSB.  
3:10 3:10 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:11 3:11 FEMALE:  Do you--
3:12 3:12 MALE:  Nay Walden [phonetic]?  
3:12 3:12 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:13 3:13 MALE:  Do you know him? 
3:14 3:14 FEMALE:  What year are you? 
3:14 3:15 MALE:  Uh, I was '02.  
3:16 3:24 FEMALE:  '02, so there's, I mean there's a ton.  It's like the Stanford, I think Princeton's second, in terms of um, no Stanford, Harvard, Princeton.  
3:25 3:25 MALE:  Okay. 
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  So it's third.  Third most representEd school.  
3:29 3:32 MALE:  I think that, see people from my year have to start coming back for business school yet. 
3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  Business school, really, yeah.  
3:35 3:38 MALE:  So I have a couple friends who are talking about doing it, but I guess like the thing these days is like you work four or five years and then come back, so.   
3:39 3:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, did you come straight from undergrad to--
3:42 3:42 MALE:  I did.   
3:42 3:45 FEMALE:  So you like had the vision.  You knew what you wanted to do.  
3:46 3:58 MALE:  You know, well I came thinking that I was just going to do Masters, and so like, engineering, like a lot of engineers do Masters these days, and so, but then I got here and liked it.  In retrospect, I wish I had taken some time off I think, just to see what working is like.   
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  It's a long stretch.  [laughter] 
4:00 4:00 MALE:  And just like, I have some like--
           [horn]
4:02 4:04 MALE:  --theoretical ideas of what workings like, but I want to now like, what it's actually like.   
4:05 4:07 FEMALE:  Know in practice.  Do you they let you do like any sort of internships over the summer? 
4:08 4:11 MALE:  Yeah I can do that.  I haven't yet been good about it.  But--
4:12 4:12 ANNOUNCER:  [unintelligible] 
4:13 4:13 MALE:  I should at some point.  Well it was good to meet you.   
4:13 4:13 FEMALE:  Well it was very nice to meet you.  
4:14 4:19 MALE:  You too, yeah, good luck with everything.
