0:02 0:03 FEMALE: Don't worry, take your time.

0:04 0:06 MALE: Hi.  Okay.  

0:03 0:06 FEMALE: I'm getting better at this.  I'm just like circling [unintelligible].

0:08 0:09 MALE: Right.  

0:06 0:07 FEMALE: I'm female230.

0:10 0:11 MALE: female230 I'm male220.

0:11 0:12 FEMALE: male220?  Nice to see you.

0:08 0:11 MALE: Nice to meet you.  So what, what department are you in?

0:11 0:13 FEMALE: I'm in MS and E.  Yourself?

0:16 0:18 MALE: Okay.  I'm, I'm in double E's.

0:15 0:16 FEMALE: Double E's.

0:18 0:19 MALE: Yeah.    

0:16 0:17 FEMALE: Are you a master's or PhD?

0:20 0:21 MALE: PhD student [unintelligible].

0:18 0:20 FEMALE: How many more--how much longer do you have?  [laughter] 

0:23 0:30 MALE: How much more?  Um I've, I've been here five and a half years, so I'm probably going to be done in December or, or next year, next winter.

0:27 0:32 FEMALE: That's awesome.  What do you plan to do, academia perhaps or work in industry?  Not sure?

0:35 0:49 MALE: Um yeah I'm not--I--not academia, I mean I'm going to--I'm going to probably look for a post-doc or something, and then maybe doing some more medical experience.  I work on, like, um ultrasound imaging.  So right now I'm kind of on the--

0:46 0:50 FEMALE: It's very interesting, um I work for uh right now I'm a volunteer for a community pregnancy center.

0:53 0:54 MALE: Oh okay.

0:51 0:59 FEMALE: Which is, you know, we, we offer counseling or uh maternity and baby services, uh, medical services to women facing crisis pregnancies.

1:02 1:03 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

1:00 1:07 FEMALE: And ultrasound is actually what humanizes the process for them.  I mean for, for women who are facing, like, something that's totally blowing their lives apart.

1:10 1:11 MALE: Yeah.  

1:8 1:14  FEMALE: It can be very reassuring and very comforting to see that, the life inside them.  Like, the ultrasound can show them what it does.

1:16 1:17 MALE: Right.  Like what's really--

1:14 1:15 FEMALE: So your work is very important.  

1:18 1:19 MALE: Oh cool.

1:16 1:17 FEMALE: I'm, I'm seeing it, I'm seeing it on a weekly basis [unintelligible].

1:20 1:22 MALE: You're [unintelligible] that's really cool.

1:19 1:23 FEMALE: Yeah.  I just started, like, a month and a half ago, but, yeah they always say it's the ultrasound that makes the women-- 

1:28 1:29 MALE: Oh yeah?

1:23 1:26 FEMALE: --have second thoughts about abortion, so.

1:29 1:33 MALE: Cool.  Yeah at least we'll uh hopefully we'll improve the ultrasound imaging, so.

1:29 1:33 FEMALE: Yeah.  So you probably work with a medical company maybe?  Are you interested in that?

1:37 1:40 MALE: Yeah.  I, yeah, I mean, that's basically, basically what I do.  

1:37 1:38 FEMALE: Right.  

1:41 1:44 MALE: I mean I do, like, intravascular imaging, stuff like that, so.  What, what--

1:39 1:44 FEMALE: That's awesome.  Well I'm in MS and E, so there's nothing engineering about what I'm doing.

1:47 1:48 MALE: Oh yeah?

1:45 1:46 FEMALE: The, the word engineering in there is like imaginary.

1:50 1:52 MALE: So you're, you're a manager or a business, businessperson, or--?

1:48 2:09 FEMALE: I would say most of my courses are about strategy, uh entrepreneurship, which is why I came to Stanford 'cause I was curious about what they talk about Silicon Valley vibe and things like that.  So I wanted to come and take a look.  But yeah there's nothing engineering basically.  I'm taking, like, uh some courses at the business school.  Uh, some management science operational research.

2:12 2:13 MALE: Right.

2:10 2:19 FEMALE: OB type things, but yeah, it's not engineering, so I'm always--I'm always uh confessing that.  That I'm not an engineering [unintelligible].

2:22 2:24 MALE: [unintelligible] you don't want any expectations of you to do any math or--

2:21 2:22 FEMALE: Yeah, no kidding, yeah.

2:25 2:27 MALE: Or any, like, technical--

2:23 2:28 FEMALE: The furthest I got with mathematics is like freshman year multi-variable calculus, and after that--

2:32 2:35 MALE: [unintelligible] optimization stuff, I'm sure that's pretty complex stuff there.

2:32 2:38 FEMALE: Well, we have optimization in MS and E, but it's not a requirement, so for people like me, we just don't take it, you know?

2:41 2:42 MALE: Yeah.  

2:38 2:41 FEMALE: So I, you ask me to optimize, I have no clue.

2:45 2:48 MALE: Cool.  So yeah what did you get your undergrad in?

2:45 2:46 FEMALE: Uh, where did I do it?

2:49 2:50 MALE: No what, like, what was your major.

2:47 2:48 FEMALE: What?  It was in econ.

2:51 2:52 MALE: Econ?

2:49 2:50 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:52 2:53 MALE: Okay.  Cool.

2:50 2:54 FEMALE: It was, like, I chose to make it more really quantitative, so [unintelligible].

2:58 3:00 MALE: So what kind of stuff are you into besides--

2:57 2:58 FEMALE: Besides--

3:01 3:03 MALE: --the MS and E and uh operational--

2:58 3:08 FEMALE: Yeah.  Believe me, we don't work in MS and E so we've got plenty of free time.  So well, I like, so far here at Stanford I like traveling around, getting to know the place.  It's such a pretty area, you know, [unintelligible].

3:11 3:12 MALE: Yeah, yeah.

3:10 3:11 FEMALE: Yosemite and stuff.

3:14 3:15 MALE: Cool.  

3:12 3:19 FEMALE: And I like music and, and theatre, so whatever chance I get I like to go to concerts or--I play an instrument myself, so I spend my time on that.

3:22 3:23 MALE: Oh what do you play?

3:20 3:21 FEMALE: I play piano, and I sing.

3:24 3:25 MALE: Oh really?

3:21 3:22 FEMALE: So, yeah.

3:25 3:26 MALE: Wow.

3:22 3:23 FEMALE: Do you play too, or?

3:26 3:36 MALE: I'm--I just started, not really.  I just, I just started--I play--I took one semester of piano like in undergrad, and then I started [unintelligible] I've taken, I've taken a couple classes here in piano, so.

3:33 3:34 FEMALE: That's awesome.

3:36 3:37 MALE: Yeah.  

3:34 3:35 FEMALE: Were you undergrad here at Stanford also?

3:38 3:39 MALE: No.

3:37 3:38 FEMALE: Oh.  Where, where did you do [unintelligible]?

3:41 3:44 MALE: In Wyoming.  I'm from Wyoming so I did my undergrad there, yeah.

3:40 3:41 FEMALE: Wyoming, ah, [unintelligible].

3:44 3:46 MALE: How about you?  Where, where are you from?

3:42 3:43 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore actually.

3:46 3:47 MALE: Okay.  

3:44 3:45 FEMALE: Which explains the weird accent [laughter].

3:48 3:50 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:47 3:50 FEMALE: A lot of my friends think I was--I'm from Britain or something, like, because you know--

3:53 3:55 MALE: It does kind of sound British, yeah.

3:51 3:53 FEMALE: Because, I mean, Singapore used to be a British colony.

3:56 3:57 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

3:54 3:57 FEMALE: So in the, in the schools, our spelling and the way they teach us to speak--

4:00 4:01 MALE: Yeah.

3:58 4:01 FEMALE: --is definitely British English, but whatever.  [horn]  I've been here three and a half years, so I'm American now.

4:04 4:05 MALE: You're an American now.

4:02 4:03 FEMALE: It's nice to meet you.

4:06 4:07 MALE: It was really nice to meet you.
