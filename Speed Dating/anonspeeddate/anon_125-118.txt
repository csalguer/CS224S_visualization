00:57  	00:58  	MALE:  Is this your first year here?

00:58  	00:59  	FEMALE:  It is.

01:00  	01:08  	MALE:  Yeah.  I completely agree.  I try and get out running everyday now. I really enjoy doing it because the weather is so nice.

01:09  	01:16  	FEMALE:  Exactly, I'm jealous you can get out running.  I have an injury that precludes me from -- I can do like a little bit, but --

01:16  	01:23  	MALE:  Yeah, I've been having a little problem with like my shins and stuff acting up, but so far I'm holding strong.

01:23  	01:25  	FEMALE:  This is a beautiful place to go running.

01:25  	01:30  	MALE:  Yeah it is.  So I though I'll take advantage while I can.

01:30  	01:34  	FEMALE:  So where did you go to school?

01:34  	01:42  	MALE:   I went to school at Purdue University in Indiana, it's a like a few hour drives from my hometown.  To go to engineering school.  What about you?

01:43  	01:43  	FEMALE:  I went to Williams College.

01:43  	01:45  	MALE:  Oh, where's that?

01:45  	01:47  	FEMALE:  In Massachusetts.

01:48  	01:48  	MALE:  Massachusetts.  Is that close to where you grew up?

01:49 	02:15  	FEMALE:  Um, I did the last few years and my dad lives in Boston, so Williams is kind of half way between.  My dad thinks that I went there because I wanted to be closer to him [laughter].  I'm like [unintelligible].  Poor dad.  It made him happy.  So yeah [unintelligible] just thinking about running was similar was beautiful to go running there, up in the mountains.

02:15  	02:16  	MALE:  Oh, oh.

02:16  	02:21  	FEMALE:  So we were kind of in a valley and you could just go up as far as you wanted to and then come back down.

02:21  	02:24  	MALE:  Is there relatively high altitudes or?

02:25  	02:33  	FEMALE:  No, I mean its Massachusetts, so high altitudes in Massachusetts are nothing compared to out here [laughter].

02:33  	02:39  	MALE:  I was just curious if there was any type of decrease of performance due to like altitude.

02:40  	02:41  	FEMALE:  No.  No.

02:41  	02:45  	MALE:  Because I've heard that that's true, but I don't really know.  Like the oxygen levels are --

02:45  	02:49  	FEMALE:  No, Massachusetts is to close to sea level for that to ever be a factor. 

02:50  	02:50  	MALE:  All right.

02:50  	02:56  	FEMALE:  I wish there was a nice [unintelligible] makes the skiing better, that's the [unintelligible].

02:57  	02:58  	MALE:  Do you go skiing a lot?

02:58  	03:07 	FEMALE:  I used to ski a lot in high school.  And then I didn't ski pretty much all through college and after college.  Um, it's expensive.

03:06 	03:07  	MALE:  Oh, I've never gone, so I don't know --

03:07  	03:11  	FEMALE:  Um, you couldn't go unless [unintelligible].

03:11  	03:11  	MALE:  Oh, yeah I bet.

03:12  	03:14  	FEMALE:  Yeah, but actually I went up in Tahoe this winter.

03:15  	03:15  	MALE:  Oh you did?

03:15  	03:19  	FEMALE: This winter.  It was great.  It was fantastic.  I only went one weekend, but wow.

03:25  	03:32  	MALE:  Wow, I've wanted to get up there and do something like that while I was here, but I just didn't have the time.  Takes like a whole weekend.

03:33  	03:36 	FEMALE:  Well you'll probably be around -- [unintelligible] next year.

03:36  	03:38  	MALE:  Yeah, next winter, yeah.  

03:38  	03:39  	FEMALE:  its fun.

03:39  	03:41  	MALE:  It's a possibility.  Hopefully, I definitely would like the experience. 

03:42 	03:52  	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean if you're going to learn to ski, Tahoe is such an amazing place to do it.  Just it's beautiful.  And I was really surprised that its not [unintelligible] difficult.  I was thinking those altitudes --

03:53  	03:53  	MALE:  So it was like a lot easier, like --

03:54  	03:59  	FEMALE:  So were [unintelligible] yeah.  I mean it's got a really wide range.

04:00  	04:03  	MALE:  That's exactly [horn] what we looked for if you're going somewhere like that.
