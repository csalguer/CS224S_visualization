0:00 0:01 FEMALE: Oh, Jesus.  
0:00 0:01 MALE: [unintelligible] How are you doing?
0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  Good, how are you male207 [phonetic]?  
0:03 0:03 MALE:  I'm pretty good. 
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:    So, the G -
0:06 0:06 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  Let me ask you about that.  How did that come about?
0:08 0:10 MALE:  Okay, are you from Canada, Minnesota?
0:10 0:16 FEMALE:  Minnesota.  [laughter].  That was really good.  Do I still sound like I'm from -
0:16 0:17 MALE:  [unintelligible],
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Did I say that?
0:19 0:23 MALE:  Give or take.  So, okay, G, the G thing, right. 
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.
0:23 0:25 MALE:  My real name's male207.
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.
0:25 0:32 MALE:  And so my parents, for some reason, always called me male207 but I was male207 the III so my grandfather [unintelligible] and keep the male207 name going.
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
0:32 0:42 MALE:  Yada, yada.  They decided they wanted to call me -- brought me home from the hospital and decided they wanted to call me male207 instead.  Thought that by changing the first letter, they could keep the initial the same and that would be better, really it's just been a disaster.  
0:42 0:42 FEMALE: [laughter].
0:44 0:46 MALE:  Really, I can't change it, 'cause I think of myself as male207 with a G.
0:46 0:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, and it would be a pain in the ass to change it too.  
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Right.  
0:49 1:10 FEMALE:  I actually -- I asked that because I had an ex or his name was nameX [phonetic], but his -- his middle name had to be nameX [phonetic], I think the same type of thing and his last name was nameX.  So they didn't want him to be nameX, because that would have been ass and that just didn't work so she spelled -- his mother spelled his name nameX [spelling].  Which -
1:10 1:11 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's no good.
1:13 1:14 MALE:  It has to be a pretty sucky -
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Why don't you just pick some other name.
1:16 1:17 MALE:  Some other middle name or -
1:18 1:22 FEMALE:  Some other name, you know, there's a lot of names, it doesn't have to be nameX.  [laughter].
1:22 1:23 MALE:  [laughter].
1:23 1:26 FEMALE:  So your story's better then that.  I thought that was stupid.  Yours at least -
1:27 1:27 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:28 1:29 FEMALE:  Kind of makes sense.  So you're Canadian?
1:30 1:31 MALE:  No, I'm not.
1:30 1:31 FEMALE:  You're not?
1:31 1:33 MALE:  I just can pick up the effect.  I'm from Virginia, near D.C.
1:35 1:36 FEMALE:  That's where I lived last.
1:36 1:37 MALE:  Oh, yeah.
1:37 1:39 FEMALE:  In Clarendon, Falls Church and Ballston.
1:41 1:41 MALE: From Vienna, Virginia.
1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  I lived in -
1:42 1:43 MALE:  They have the Orange Bowl there.
1:43 1:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.   I lived um, well, so I actually lived in Vienna -
1:48 1:49 MALE:  Cool.
1:48 1:50 FEMALE:  I was not -- I think I was next to Falls Church.
1:50 1:51 MALE:  Tell me more.  Tell me where.
1:53 1:56 FEMALE:  I don't remember, some apartment complex.
1:56 1:57 MALE:  Were you near 123?
1:58 2:02 FEMALE:  I can't -- I can't remember anything about D.C.  Like I moved out here and I made it all go away.
2:02 2:03 MALE:  Okay, good.
2:03 2:07 FEMALE:  It's like I'm never going to remember anything.  I remember -- was it 66?
2:07 2:07 MALE:  66.
2:07 2:10 FEMALE:  Is that -- yeah, okay.  So, I worked in McClain.
2:11 2:11 MALE: Cool.
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  Um, and -
2:13 2:13 MALE: What company?
2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  Capital One.
2:15 2:16 MALE:  I used [unintelligible].
2:17 2:24 FEMALE:  Near tys -- it's like McClain, but it's like right down the street, so.  So, did you spend your whole growing up in D.C.?
2:24 2:25 MALE:  Yep.
2:24 2:27 FEMALE:  How did you like Vienna as a place to grow up?
2:27 2:30 MALE:  I mean, I'm [unintelligible] suburb [unintelligible] suburban.
2:31 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:34 2:35 MALE:  It's a good area.
2:35 2:35 FEMALE:  Would you go back?
2:35 2:37 MALE:  I would.  My high school's pretty awesome.
2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, Thomas Jefferson, yeah.  People seem to have a lot of allegiance to Thomas Jefferson.
2:45 2:52 MALE:  It's good.  I mean, it's just like -- it really prepared me for college and stuff.  Like I felt like I went to college [unintelligible].
2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:55 3:02 MALE:  It's nice to go to school, particularly in high school, because I think a lot of like people who are into school and stuff, because I used to go to high school where [unintelligible].
3:02 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But it's public isn't it?
3:04 3:05 MALE:  It is.
3:05 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:06 3:07 MALE:  It's a magnet school.
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  It's a magnet, okay, yeah.  Cool.  Well, that's cool.  And so you'd even go back even though the summers suck?
3:12 3:16 MALE:  I don't think I'd -- no, I don't think I -- I love California, man.
3:16 3:17 FEMALE:  I know.
3:17 3:18 MALE:  It happens, right.
3:19 3:24 FEMALE:  I told somebody else to go to Virginia so that they'd realize how good California was.  Kind of a little bit of bias, obviously. 
3:25 3:28 MALE:  I'm okay with the fact that you're not a big Virginia fan.
3:28 3:33 FEMALE:  Well, I get the same thing about Minnesota, right?  They're like oh, it's freezing.  I'm like, well, I grew up there, so, you know.
3:33 3:33 MALE:  It is?
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So.
3:35 3:41 MALE:  Apparently I read an article recently that said that Minneapolis is the number one technical city in the country -- technology city in the country.

3:47 3:47 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:47 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, hospitals, stuff like that.  I mean it's a completely different place then when I grew up there.  It was very, you know, it's actually a cool place to live now, I would think, so.
