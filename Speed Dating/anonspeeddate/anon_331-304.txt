00:23 00:41 FEMALE: Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  Um, I went to school in LA and I go back there tonight and I got this little, like, newsboy style hat and I thought maybe, like, cool, like, I was going to come back with the big earrings and wear, like, the hat, maybe some, like, big, old, pink LA sunglasses and come up to my [unintelligible] and be, like, hey, guys.  What's up?  You know.  Like, I thought that was fun.  I didn't do it.  
00:39 00:39 MALE: You didn't do it?  
00:42 00:54 FEMALE: No.  Well, like, I have to get evaluated at the end of the [laughter] you know, [unintelligible].  It'd be kind of funny to have your TA show up, like, they think they're all ghetto cool and then it'd be ridiculous on me too, but [unintelligible].  
00:53 00:54 MALE: [laughter]
00:58 01:02 FEMALE: Today we be discussing literature.  [laughter]   What do you do here by the way?  
00:59 01:03 MALE: I'm a [unintelligible] resident.  Um, I've been here just over a year.  
01:06 01:08 FEMALE: Um, you're only--this is your second year or your first year?  
01:06 01:06 MALE: This is my first year.  
01:09 01:10 FEMALE: Okay.  
01:08 01:09 MALE: Not over a year.  
01:11 01:20 FEMALE: That's what I thought.  Over a year I'm, like, what happened?  [laughter] Do you know how to do math?  [laughter] I don't.  So I'm an English major.  
01:18 01:19 MALE: Oh, nice.  
01:22 01:23 FEMALE: Yeah, Ph.D. English.  I have no idea.  
01:21 01:21 MALE: How refreshing. 
01:24 01:24 FEMALE: Really?  
01:21 01:23 MALE: I don't meet any English [unintelligible].
01:25 01:26 FEMALE: No?  Who do you hang out with?  
01:24 01:27 MALE: I hang out with all engineers or mostly engineers.  
01:31 01:31 FEMALE: Do you live on campus?  
01:29 01:36 MALE: No, I live off campus.  Next year I'm moving on campus.  Right now I live with my--my brother and my brother's family--
01:37 01:39 FEMALE: Oh, wow.  
01:36 01:37 MALE: In Sunnyvale.  
01:39 01:43 FEMALE: So, yeah, so you don't really get with [unintelligible] You see your family and then, like, the people in class, right?  So...
01:42 01:48 MALE: Yeah, no, I met a good group of friends here.  Um, some econ majors but mostly [unintelligible] 
01:49 01:54 FEMALE: Okay.  Wow.  Um, so your program is how many years?  Five?  
01:53 01:54 MALE: Um, it could be anywhere from two to five years.  
01:57 02:05 FEMALE: Okay.  For us it's like five and on, I think.  So you have to do all this teaching and then we have to write a dissertation, so I don't know.  It's like--
02:02 02:03 MALE: I'm sorry, what--oh, English.  Right.  
02:05 02:15 FEMALE: English.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I don't know.  We don't have the option of, like, speeding it up necessarily.  Like you guys, how does that work for you guys?  Like, could you do a math service and then you're done?  
02:13 02:16 MALE: We can do math and then leave or we can just keep on going.  Whatever you wanted.  
02:19 02:19 FEMALE: Do you know?  
02:17 02:20 MALE: It's very competitive.  That's the thing.  They just--they kind of push you out if you're not--
02:23 02:24 FEMALE: Oh, it is competitive?  
02:21 02:26 MALE: Yeah.  It's probably different from English because it's probably like you go in and then you're in there.  
02:27 02:45 FEMALE: Yeah, because they don't pick very many people but they kind of like--when you're there they kind of nurture you, I guess.  Plus, like, there's not--like, there's not that many jobs available for us anyway so they just take us, you know, like, all right.  We really want you guys to succeed. [unintelligible]  And so for you, do you think you'll stay the second year?  Or--I mean, sorry, after the second year?  
02:43 02:46 MALE: Um, I'm thinking about it.  I'm definitely going to stay in the area.  
02:49 02:50 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
02:48 02:50 MALE: I spent most of my life in New York and I think I want to stay here.  
02:53 02:57 FEMALE: What--I've never really been to New York.  Like, how would you compare New York to here?  
02:56 02:57 MALE: It's much more laid back here.  
02:59 03:00 FEMALE: Here, yeah.  
02:58 03:01 MALE: This is better.  Uh, a lot of girls for this kind of unit.    
03:04 03:04 FEMALE: Where, in New York?  
03:01 03:02 MALE: I grew up in, like--  
03:05 03:08 FEMALE: No, that's so funny that's why don't see [unintelligible] but it's really funny.  
03:06 03:10 MALE: Yeah, because I grew up in, like, Brooklyn and then all the girls wear the hoops, big hoop earrings and stuff.  
03:12 03:17 FEMALE: Yep, it's a more ethnic kind of thing but yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like that's something like a bandana, a little hat [unintelligible] 
03:15 03:20 MALE:  Yeah, so.  I mean, I see all that but, I mean, here, I love it here.  I mean, people are nice here.  
03:23 03:30 FEMALE: There is, like--I think there is a laid back feeling.   I mean my brother goes to school on the East Coast.  You'd think everyone there was, like, personality, like fucked up, you know, this is not.  
03:30 03:31 MALE: Yeah.  It's definitely different.  
03:33 03:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
03:32 03:34 MALE: Well, what about you, you like East Coast, West Coast?  
03:36 04:16 FEMALE:  I mean very--I want to say California.  I would be a professor but I definitely want to get a job in California.  Maybe like West Coast.  Maybe, like, Oregon or Seattle, but I don't want to, you know.  I love, I love, like, sun.  It makes me sad when it's, like, you know, raining all the time and--I don't know.  I wanted to meet because, you know, have nice, like, I don't know, I like the laid-back feel.  I definitely, I mean, I was, like, can I go in my pajama pants in this thing?  Probably not, you know, so [laughter].  But you know what I mean, like, I just like to be casual and that kind of thing, so...  What about you, like, you like the casual or do you just feel like people are nicer here?  'Cause a lot of people say we're fake, you know, like Californians are fake and New Yorkers are real.  What about the things that you do?  
04:14 04:16 MALE: I think [unintelligible] in New York.  [unintelligible] 
04:19 04:20 FEMALE: Cool, right?  [laughter] 
04:19 04:20 MALE: Anyway, pleasure meeting you.  
04:22 04:23 FEMALE: Nice to meet you too.  
04:21 04:22 MALE: What's your name, female331?  
04:24 04:24 FEMALE: female331 Fuller.
