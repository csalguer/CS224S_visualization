00:04  00:05	FEMALE:  Oh, no, no I see the question it's so weird.
00:06  00:07	MALE:  What's that.  Oh, I thought you said is there a question -- yeah I understand.  It's difficult to answer them [horn] too.
00:08  00:13	FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean how do you tell if someone's courteous is five or four minutes.  I mean how rude can you really be in four minutes?
00:14  00:15	MALE:  You're name's female238, right?
00:15  00:16	FEMALE:  Yeah I'm female238.
00:16  00:17	MALE:  Hi, I'm male214.
00:17  00:17	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
00:17  00:21	MALE:  I was talking to one girl earlier and I sat down and she was continuing to write on her sheet.
00:22  00:22	FEMALE:  Right.
00:22  00:30	MALE:  Four about 30 seconds and we're given about three or four minutes.  So for a quarter of our time together she was just spending time trying to fill out the last evaluations --
00:30  00:31	FEMALE:  Oh.
00:32  00:33	MALE: Even though we're given two minutes to fill it out. 
00:33  00:38	FEMALE:  Okay.  Well I guess I could be less than a ten on courtesy or something.  I don't know.
00:39  00:40	MALE:  So what do you do here at school?
00:40  00:47	FEMALE:  Um, I'm finishing up my PhD.  Um, I should finish this summer in linguistics.  So, I write all day is what I do.
00:48  00:51	MALE:  Okay.  Do you want to work here?  Like work here in San Francisco or away?
00:52  01:09	FEMALE:  Um, I'm kind of planning on going back to D.C. which is where I grew up from before I came here.  But, I don't know I'm looking around at jobs in the area.  But yeah, I just feel like its so -- it would be so hard to get established here.  Like the housing prices are just crazy and things like that.
01:10  01:10	MALE:  Right.
01:11  01:12	FEMALE:  So, I don't know.  What about you?
01:13  01:27	MALE:  Well, I got a job offer to LA, but I don't want to work there.  So I've decided to stay for another Masters.  So I'll be here for another two yeas.  I did mechanical engineering and then I'll be doing aerospace.  So D.C. is one of those places I might go, you know.
01:28  01:28	FEMALE:  Okay.
01:29  01:30	MALE:  Because of NASA.  
01:30  01:31	FEMALE:  Ah-huh. 
01:31  01:33	MALE:  So it just depends on what I get to work on.
01:34  01:34	FEMALE:  Right, yeah.
01:35  01:36	MALE:  So you said linguistics right?
01:36  01:37	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:37  01:37	MALE:   So you write all day.
01:38  01:39	FEMALE:  Well, I mean that's not what linguists do typically, but that's what people think.
01:40  01:40	MALE:  Oh, okay I see, I see.
01:41  01:42	FEMALE:  That's what people writing their dissertations do, all day, so.
01:42  01:43	MALE:  Right.
01:43  01:44	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:44  01:57	MALE:  I took a technical writing class at the request of my sister.  She proofread my statement of purpose and said I could use more help on form and just basics so I learned a lot.
01:58  01:58	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:59  02:01	MALE:  But it took me forever to write.  So I guess -- I guess it takes a lot of practice.
02:02  02:02	FEMALE:  It does, it does.
02:03  02:04	MALE:  So what's your necklace.  I see it and it's really nice.
02:05  02:14	FEMALE:  Oh, it flipped over.  It's just a plain old, plain I don't know old square. I don't think -- it's something costume I don't think it's anything.
02:15  02:15	MALE:  It's nice.  
02:15  02:16	FEMALE:  Thank you.
02:16  02:17	MALE:  Is that wood in the middle?
02:17  02:18	FEMALE:  No, I think its all -- I mean you can feel it.  Maybe it is wood.
02:19  02:20	MALE:  It is wood, yeah.  It's nice.
02:21  02:22	FEMALE:  I just liked it because it matched my skirt.
02:23  02:23	MALE:  Oh, okay, cool.
02:24  02:28	FEMALE:  But, um, yeah.  A little five dollar something I found somewhere.
02:29  02:30	MALE:  It looks nice.  Nice design.  
02:30  02:31	FEMALE:  Well, thank you.
02:31  02:33	MALE:  Looks good on you.  So what do you do for fun?
02:33  02:37	FEMALE:  What do I do for fun?  I cook and I um, do a lot of Yoga.
02:38  02:38	MALE:  Oh, okay.
02:39  02:39	FEMALE:  Yeah.  
02:40  02:41	MALE:  I tried it once.
02:41  02:42	FEMALE:  Really?  How did you like it?
02:42  02:46	MALE:  It was difficult.  I'm going to give it another shot sometime maybe next year [laughter].
02:47  02:48	FEMALE:  Okay, that long huh?  Time to recover?
02:48  02:50	MALE:  Well, I'm just trying to finish everything for my Masters.
02:51  02:59	FEMALE:  Right, right.  Yeah.  So yeah, cook, do a lot of Yoga, hang out with my housemates, I live with a whole gang of people.  You know.  Stuff, movies, you know [unintelligible].
03:01  03:02	MALE:  Do you live in Raines?
03:03  03:04	FEMALE:  No, I live off campus.
03:05  03:05	MALE:  Oh, okay.  
03:06  03:06	FEMALE:  Yeah, so.
03:06  03:08	MALE:  Yeah, I might be living off campus too.  I used to live at Blackwelder which -- well I am living at Blackwelder which is across from GCC.
03:09  03:12	FEMALE:  Is that the high rise one or?
03:13  03:17	MALE:  Yeah.  So, it's nice, because I've organized some events at the GCC, like a Valentine's party.  I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
03:18  03:22	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
03:23  03:28	MALE:  And it's nice to live next door to it because there's a lot of action there.  Except my priorities run out so I might have to move off campus.  
03:29  03:29	FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.
03:30  03:31	MALE:  Because I'm not doing a PhD I'm only doing two Masters.
03:32  03:32	FEMALE:  Right, right.
03:33  03:37	MALE:  So, it's kind of a bummer because I really want to stay on campus and today's my birthday and I found out the bad news yesterday.
03:38  03:39	FEMALE:  Oh, happy birthday.
03:40  03:40	MALE:  Yeah, thanks.
03:41  03:45	FEMALE:  You're doing this on your birthday?  Are you going out for something more exciting afterwards I hope?
03:46  03:47	MALE:  No, I have a mid-term tomorrow.
03:48  03:48	FEMALE:  Oh no.  
03:49  03:49	MALE:  That's okay.
03:50  03:51	FEMALE:  Well, this weekend I hope you can celebrate.
03:51  03:53	MALE:  This is fun.  Because you get to talk to people, I like talking to people.
03:54  03:54	FEMALE:  I guess you might --
03:55  03:56	MALE:  I mean how often can you meet?
03:56  03:57	FEMALE:  Twenty people.
03:57  03:59	MALE:  Well twenty one personalities, because I got to meet a guy earlier for our [unintelligible].
04:00  04:00	FEMALE:  Right, exactly.  Plus, Subtle, makes twenty-two.  
04:05  04:06	MALE:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
04:07  04:08	FEMALE:  That's a good point [horn].  Well, happy birthday, it was really nice to meet you.
