1:06 1:09 MALE: So did you participate in the Stanford solar car project?
1:07 1:12 FEMALE: Um, no.  No.  It's just kind of more of a theory, theoretical thing, some research.
1:20 1:21 MALE: Where did you grow up?
1:19 1:21 FEMALE: Um, I grew up here, actually, in Palo Alto.
1:24 1:25 MALE: Oh really?

1:26 1:33 MALE: Oh.  I visited Hong Kong last year, but only for two days.
1:30 1:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  So it was a very nice place.  I like it.  We went back there maybe a year ago.  [unintelligible] my dad's [unintelligible].
1:42 1:42 MALE: So you speak Cantonese?
1:41 1:51 FEMALE: I should [laughter].  I don't really anymore.  But um, I can usually understand somebody speaking Cantonese, but I can't speak back, so.
1:54 1:56 MALE: So when your parents talk to each other, do they speak Cantonese?
1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.

1:59 1:59 FEMALE: YeahYeah.
2:04 2:04 MALE: But you cannot really speak?
2:01 2:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's kind of hard to like actually speak Cantonese, but I can understand it pretty well, so.
2:10 2:11 MALE: Uh, what do you do for fun?
2:09 2:09 FEMALE: Um, I ride horses.
2:13 2:14 MALE: Oh really?
2:11 2:16 FEMALE: So yeah, I ride them pretty much every day.  So yeah.  It's kind of a--
2:20 2:22 MALE: Is it a hobby or a sport?
2:19 2:26 FEMALE: It's a sport.  It's way beyond a hobby for me at this point, um, so.  Kind of one of those things.
2:30 2:31 MALE: Do you always ride the same horse or?
2:29 2:35 FEMALE: Um, right now I am 'cause I'm working with one of my--one of the horses that my trainer owns.  So--

2:44 2:47 MALE: Is it, uh, in the Stanford barn?
2:43 2:54 FEMALE: Um, no, I used to ride there.  But they're remodeling.  So I'm kind of up in the hills now.  We had to move.  It happens.
3:01 3:01 MALE: Um, do you like movies?
2:58 3:04 FEMALE: Sometimes.  I don't know.  It depends.  I like good ones.  
3:08 3:08 MALE: Uh, like what?
3:06 3:09 FEMALE: Usually they're not so good.  Um, the last one I saw, though, that was good was In Good Company.
3:13 3:13 MALE: In Good Company?
3:11 3:20 FEMALE: That came out like two months, three months ago, maybe?  So I haven't really been since.  How about you?
3:24 3:26 MALE: You're busy with your work?
3:24 3:32 FEMALE: I just don't go to movies that often.  It's usually kind of more as a dinner or hang out or something.  So.  How long have you been here?
3:35 3:55 MALE: Uh, five years.  The first few years, I went to see a movie in the theater very often.  But later, I've just been, I've just been too lazy to drive all the way there, and so.  But I still enjoy watching movies on [unintelligible].
3:55 3:57 FEMALE: You're almost done.  Are you going to be defending your thesis soon?
4:01 4:06 MALE: Uh [laughter].  Nice to meet you.
4:03 4:03 FEMALE: It's good to meet you.
