0:55 0:59 MALE: [laughter].

0:58 0:59 FEMALE: [laughter].  No, not really.

1:03 1:09 MALE: [laughter].  We do this a dozen times, and you know, we'll get to really know each other, and it'll be almost like -- almost like a full date.  [laughter].

1:07 1:12 FEMALE: [laughter].  So what else do you do, besides study and do work?

1:15 1:35 MALE: What else am I doing?  Um... I uh, I like to read books, I guess.  I like to watch T.V., I just got a subscription to this Internet service that shows all the baseball games, so you can watch like any game live.

1:33 1:33 FEMALE: Nice.

1:35 1:37 MALE: Which is really, really stupid.

1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Are you a big baseball fan?

1:38 1:40 MALE: Like I spend like five hours a day watching just baseball.

1:37 1:38 FEMALE: What's your favorite team?

1:41 1:41 MALE: Angels.

1:40 1:40 FEMALE: Why the Angels?

1:43 1:47 MALE: Um, 'cause when I was like, you know, in Little League I played on the Angels, so like...

1:45 1:46 FEMALE: You played on the Angels?

1:48 1:49 MALE: Yeah.  Like my team was the Angels.

1:48 1:49 FEMALE: Ah-hah, I see, like your -

1:51 1:53 MALE: So like a feeling of some spirit -

1:49 1:51 FEMALE: - got it.  Like a spiritual connection?

1:53 1:53 MALE: Right.  

1:52 1:52 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:55 1:58 MALE: Um, the most hideous announcers ever.  

1:56 1:56 FEMALE: Really?

1:58 2:08 MALE: Their announcers just like, they think like the Angels -- like all the Angels are the best players ever, they're extremely obnoxious, they say the same thing every single game, and of course I'm an idiot because I watch every single game.

2:06 2:08 FEMALE: Right, right.  So you hear it over and over and over again.

2:09 2:13 MALE: So like I feel like my brain has been rotting so much since baseball season started.

2:11 2:11 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:14 2:14 MALE: It's horrible.

2:12 2:15 FEMALE: Did you -- who did you root for with the whole Sox-Yankees thing?

2:18 2:24 MALE: Um, I generally hate the Yankees, and I hate the Red Sox more, so I actually rooted for the Yankees.

2:22 2:23 FEMALE: Why do hate the Sox?

2:26 2:28 MALE: Um, 'cause they're all a bunch of idiots.

2:27 2:27 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:31 2:38 MALE: No, because, uh, actually like, there's something -- Boston fans are rabid and angry, and like -

2:35 2:35 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:38 2:44 MALE: - they do all the -- they, they, they -- they think that the world revolves around them, you know?  We've gone like a hundred years, blah, blah, blah, without winning.

2:42 2:42 FEMALE: Right, right.

2:45 2:54 MALE: But like other teams haven't won either, you know?  Like -- and the other thing is like, the Yankees go one year without winning, it's not really going to matter in the grand scheme of things.  You know, Yankees fans, whatever.  

2:51 2:51 FEMALE: Right.

2:55 3:02 MALE: The Red Sox, to see their fans experience that, is just like a dagger in my heart, you know what I mean?

3:01 3:02 FEMALE: [laughter].

3:03 3:08 MALE: You know, like this is something that I could have prevented, you know what I mean?  Like, it's just -- I wanted to see like -

3:05 3:07 FEMALE: To much satisfaction for... yeah.

3:09 3:13 MALE: Exactly.  And like the delta in happiness level was so much greater with the Red Sox winning, you know?

3:11 3:11 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:14 3:17 MALE: So it's just like really about it for me.

3:15 3:20 FEMALE: One of my friends is a big Sox fan, so I was happy for him.  I could care less, I don't really watch sports.

3:22 3:23 MALE: So what have you been doing?

3:23 3:27 FEMALE: Hmm... taking classes, I'm working like three part-time jobs right now.

3:30 3:31 MALE: Three part-time jobs?

3:29 3:34 FEMALE: Yeah.  And I haven't quite adjusted to the student, like, budget yet.

3:36 3:36 MALE: [laughter]. 

3:34 3:47 FEMALE: And I have debt, but I want to try and pay it off, so like, whatever.  And then I just hang out with friends and -- oops, um, I don't know, I spend a lot of time at Starbucks, reading.

3:49 3:51 MALE: That's cool.  I love Starbucks.

3:48 3:53 FEMALE: Drinking coffee.  I spend most of my discretionary money there, I think.  And um...

3:54 3:59 MALE: That's cool.  We should go sometime.  We could have like a real, um - 

3:56 3:56 FEMALE: Conversation.

4:01 4:01 MALE: Yeah.

3:57 3:59 FEMALE: A non-timed conversation.  [laughter].

4:01 4:03 MALE: Yeah, a conversation that doesn't have to end -

4:00 4:00 FEMALE: [laughter].

4:04 4:05 MALE: - with the sound of a horn.

4:02 4:03 FEMALE: To the horn, yeah.  [laughter].

4:06 4:09 MALE:  Last time I recall it being slightly more pleasant a sound.

4:06 4:11 FEMALE:  Actually I like -- yeah, the sound, but it was so loud.  This is much better.

4:11 4:17 MALE:  Yeah, this is a very -- much better venue.  All right, I get the message, I should never talk -

4:16 4:17 FEMALE:  Bye.  [laughter].

4:21 4:22 MALE:  What was your letter, female221?

4:20 4:20 FEMALE:  A.

4:23 4:25 MALE:  Oh wow, you were here early.
