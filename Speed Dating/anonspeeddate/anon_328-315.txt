0:01:28.4 0:01:37.5 FEMALE:  Oh.  [laughter].  No, it's um- it's been interesting.  It's interesting.  There's definitely a huge difference in populations across schools.
0:01:40.3 0:01:42.9 MALE:  Yeah, but they're all a little geeky.  That's why I'm coming to learn.
0:01:41.3 0:01:42.7 FEMALE:  Even the business school people?
0:01:44.6 0:01:46.4 MALE:  Well, no.  I mean them, not us.
0:01:44.6 0:01:47.6 FEMALE:  Across the street.  Have you met any- anybody from the law school?
0:01:50.4 0:01:55.5 MALE:  Uh, good God not yet, no.  I mean, I have like outside this-
0:01:53.6 0:01:55.5 FEMALE:   But I think we're more akin to the business-
0:01:57.1 0:01:58.2 MALE:   No.  Are you kidding me?
0:01:56.3 0:01:56.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:59.1 0:02:01.8 MALE:  Oh.  I had- I went sailing with this law school girl.
0:01:59.6 0:02:00.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:01.6 0:02:02.7 MALE:  It was so ridiculous.
0:02:01.6 0:02:02.2 FEMALE:  How so?
0:02:04.0 0:02:05.1 MALE:  They're just not fun people.
0:02:03.3 0:02:05.0 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:02:06.7 0:02:12.2 MALE:  They're trained from their- this all- to all sue each other.  And they just- it doesn't- it doesn't make for a conducive-
0:02:08.4 0:02:10.4 FEMALE:   Yeah, that could put a damper on things.
0:02:12.1 0:02:12.9 MALE:  Exactly.  
0:02:10.2 0:02:11.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:12.8 0:02:16.2 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  So did you find out any information on the fables?
0:02:14.8 0:02:20.3 FEMALE:  Um, not- other- other than the werewolves- uh, the werewolf thing.
0:02:22.6 0:02:24.4 MALE:  I'm surprised there- there has to book in green.  
0:02:22.8 0:02:24.0 FEMALE:  I'm sure-
0:02:25.0 0:02:26.4 MALE:   We just have to put a little research on it.
0:02:24.4 0:02:31.7 FEMALE:  I'm sure, yeah.  I just need to go and spend some time on it.  But I- I don't want to push nameX 'cause I know she's so busy, so.  But she's like oh well, you know, I'll see what I can find.
0:02:32.7 0:02:36.4 MALE:  Well, she has time to be in [unintelligible] shows, so I think she has time to do fable research for you.
0:02:33.7 0:02:34.9 FEMALE:  She may have some time now.
0:02:37.2 0:02:40.4 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't realize that she was Turkish.
0:02:36.7 0:02:41.0 FEMALE:  She's- yeah, she's part Turkish.  Have you-
0:02:43.3 0:02:49.5 MALE:   Actually I did realize that because she's studying Turkey.  There you go.  So it makes sense that she's belly dancing on stage.
0:02:48.3 0:02:52.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Well, that and the fact that she's just like hot and knows how to belly dance, so.
0:02:54.9 0:03:00.6 MALE:  Well, I don't know if she's hot but she's- she's certainly, you know, good enough.
0:02:59.3 0:03:00.6 FEMALE:  [laughter] Good enough for?
0:03:02.7 0:03:03.3 MALE:  What?
0:03:01.6 0:03:02.7 FEMALE:  Good enough for?
0:03:04.6 0:03:07.1 MALE:  You know, to be in general circulation, you know.
0:03:06.1 0:03:07.1 FEMALE:  You know she's married.
0:03:09.0 0:03:09.4 MALE:  What?
0:03:07.5 0:03:08.5 FEMALE:  You know she's married.
0:03:10.5 0:03:12.4 MALE:  No, she doesn't- she didn't mentioned that at the dinner.
0:03:11.7 0:03:14.8 FEMALE:  She probably mentioned- she's probably assumed everyone knew 'cause-
0:03:17.2 0:03:23.1 MALE:   No, she was uh--it's weird 'cause the way that she was playing footsie with me, I wouldn't have expected her to be married.
0:03:21.0 0:03:24.5 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  Well, you- you must have overcome that uh-
0:03:26.1 0:03:29.3 MALE:   And those big, batting eyes. I mean that was ridiculous.
0:03:28.5 0:03:29.3 FEMALE:  Oh, 'cause-
0:03:30.4 0:03:31.3 MALE:   She was married?
0:03:30.5 0:03:31.4 FEMALE:  She is married.
0:03:33.2 0:03:35.5 MALE:  That was- I can't believe that she led me on that way.
0:03:33.9 0:03:34.5 FEMALE:  Oh.
0:03:38.6 0:03:42.5 MALE:  [laughter]. [unintelligible] 
0:03:37.4 0:03:38.7 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:03:48.0 0:03:48.8 MALE:  So.
0:03:48.6 0:03:53.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's just- it's- it's your- it's the effect you have on women.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
0:03:54.2 0:03:56.4 MALE:  My effect?  Oh, they can't resist me.
0:03:55.2 0:03:55.6 FEMALE:  Clearly.
0:03:57.4 0:04:00.2 MALE:  That- that- you should take that into consideration for your study.
0:03:58.8 0:04:00.9 FEMALE:  Oh baby.  male315 is so hot.
0:04:02.7 0:04:06.1 MALE:  That's right.  [unintelligible], she's going to give me a ten.  Um-
0:04:04.6 0:04:05.7 FEMALE:   Eyes rolling.
0:04:07.4 0:04:11.1 MALE:  [laughter].  It's not true.  They're not rolling.  
0:04:06.1 0:04:07.5 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:04:11.3 0:04:12.3 [horn]
0:04:12.7 0:04:13.2 MALE:  All right.

0:04:19.6 0:04:25.4 MALE:  Thank you.  I uh- I'm hoping to uh, you know, do my residency soon, so.
0:04:23.6 0:04:24.7 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:04:26.1 0:04:26.5 MALE:  All right.
0:04:25.1 0:04:26.0 FEMALE:  See you in the lab.
0:04:27.9 0:04:28.4 MALE:  All right.
