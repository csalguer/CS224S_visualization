And all the filling out I think is what's really confusing my brain is like the, is that it feels like sort of half standardized tests.  It's like you feel like getting sort of like really serious, as if I've got to like, sort of like -- yeah this is --

1:43 1:44 MALE:  Is that part of the education?  

1:41 1:49 FEMALE:  That's my major like my specialization, but I feel I'm just entering the area so I don't really know.  

1:54 1:55 MALE:  So you're still trying to figure out what's going on.  

1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  

1:56 1:56 MALE:  Interesting.  

1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

1:58 1:59 MALE:  Have you been to California for long?  

1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  This is my second year here.  

2:01 2:04 MALE:  Oh.  This is my third year in California.  

2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Oh.  

2:06 2:13 MALE:  My third year at Stanford too.  I'm in a seven or eight year program.  It usually goes on for awhile.  I know like --  

2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  What's your major?  

2:15 2:15 MALE:  Russian literature.  

2:12 2:12 FEMALE:  Huh?  

2:16 2:17 MALE:  Russian literature.  

2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  Oh cool.  

2:19 2:26 MALE:  Russia and the language and the people.  It's a fun time.  It's a very interesting thing to study.  

2:23 2:25 FEMALE:  Are your parents from Russia?  

2:29 2:44 MALE:  My grandparents are from Russia, so a little bit back.  My parents don't know any Russian.  My mom said they've been in America like forever and my dad's side, yeah all from Russia.  How about yourself, where are you originally from?  

2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  China.  

2:45 2:45 MALE:  Okay.  

2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

2:46 2:46 MALE:  Where from?  

2:44 2:45 FEMALE:  The East Coast, like Shanghai.  

2:49 2:50 MALE:  Okay, Shanghai.  

2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

2:51 2:55 MALE:  Shanghai.  The only area I've been around, I've been to Hong Kong, but that's not too close to Shanghai.  

2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  Oh I haven't been to Hong Kong.  

2:56 3:15 MALE:  Yeah I was only there for like two days, really passing through quickly.  I was there with a friend whose mother from Hong Kong so I know a little bit about it, but very interesting.  For some reason I thought it would be busier.  I would think it would be like really, really busy.  It wasn't quite as busy as I thought it was going to be.  

3:11 3:21 FEMALE:  Really?  That was my impression with Hong Kong too.  I feel like [unintelligible] like the [unintelligible] like a very exciting place.  

3:26 3:41 MALE:  Yeah, it's very exciting.  I just thought it'd be a little bit more, like I thought with so many people like you know moving.  I guess maybe I was just getting like a little bit carried away, like [unintelligible] imagination.  But it was really interesting.  It was very, very interesting to be in the city.  

3:38 3:42 FEMALE:  So what do you think it could be more imaginative?  

3:46 3:57 MALE:  Or at least in my imagination, in my imagination it was like a lot crazier.  So I'm probably the only person who's been to Hong Kong [unintelligible] like I really expected like a lot more people.  

3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  Really.  

3:59 4:00 MALE:  Very nice.  female236 it was very nice to meet you.  

3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah you too.  

4:01 4:01 MALE:  Have a good rest of the night.  

3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  You too.
