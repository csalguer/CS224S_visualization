00:01  00:01	MALE:  Want a mint.
00:04  00:09	FEMALE:  Yes.  I would love. You're a lifesaver.  I need something to pep me up.
00:10  00:19	MALE:  Yeah, these are fairly peppy.  They sell caffienated mints which they're just -- I think their brilliant.  It's like taking uppers but without the whole social stigma of taking caffeine pills. 
00:20  00:21	FEMALE:  Like caffeine water. Heard of that?
00:21  00:26	MALE:  [laughter] I've heard of that stuff.  Don't people brew coffee with the caffeine water to get super strong?
00:27  00:29	FEMALE:  That is brilliant.
00:30  00:30	MALE:  Yeah.
00:31  00:31	MALE2:  Not a med student I guess.
00:34  00:34	FEMALE:  No.
00:35  00:37	MALE:  It's called nameX water I guess
00:38  00:38	MALE2:  That is nuts.
00:39  00:41	FEMALE:  I used to drink it in college, its good stuff.
00:42  00:45	MALE:  All sorts of --
00:46  00:48	FEMALE:  There's testost -- there's Bull --
00:49  00:54	MALE:  It's not the Bull thing, no, no it's toren something amino acid -- it's not from Bull its some amino acid from something.  I don't know what.
00:56  01:01	FEMALE:  Oh, I heard there was like bull semen or something in it, so I never drink it [laughter].  It was like something disgusting, bull fluid.
01:02  01:06	MALE:  That's funny because there's um, a town I lived in actually sells, well the prairie oysters or whatever you call them [horn].
01:07  01:07	FEMALE:  Okay.
01:08  01:10	MALE:  Sell those in restaurants bull type --
01:11  01:11	FEMALE:  Where are you from?
01:12  01:14	MALE:  Alberta.  So, Canadian, Texas pretty much.
01:15  01:15	FEMALE:  Okay.
01:16  01:16	MALE:  How about yourself?
01:16  01:17	FEMALE:  And that's a delicacy up there?
01:17  01:25	MALE:   It's pretty rare and it grosses people out, so some places sell it as oh, it's a party cowboy, yee-haw, type thing.
01:26  01:26	FEMALE:  Right.  Okay.
01:27  01:27	MALE:  Not really my thing.
01:28  01:34	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm from Cincinnati, sorry you asked a second ago.  And then lived in D.C. and now I've been here for a while.  But --
01:35  01:36	MALE:  What were you doing in D.C. where you in college?
01:36  01:40	FEMALE:  Um, yeah, I went to college there and then stuck around for a little bit after.
01:41  01:42	MALE:  Where did -- which school in D.C.?
01:42  01:42	FEMALE:  Georgetown.
01:43  01:45	MALE:  Oh, Georgetown.  Okay, I have a friend that went to Georgetown.
01:46  01:47	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] is, so --
01:48  01:49	MALE:  D.C. is [horn], I really visited a couple of times it was very --.  What the hell.
01:50  01:51	FEMALE:  I'm confused.
01:53  01:54	MALE: Someone just likes the horn.
01:54  01:58	FEMALE:  male203, you're taking more of your fair share of date time.  You're getting like an extra minute compared to everyone else.   
01:59  01:59	MALE:  Oh, that's just not fair.
02:00  02:01	FEMALE:  It's just going to throw off the results I think.
02:03  02:03	MALE:  Definitely.
02:04  02:04	FEMALE:  [laughter]
02:05  02:06	MALE:  Sorry about that.  
02:06  02:07	FEMALE:  Sorrry, you said Sorrry yeah.
02:07  02:08	MALE:  I'm from Canada, I've got the -- 
02:08  02:10	FEMALE:  I live with a Canadian, she's really got the ooo and it's great.
02:11  02:20	MALE:  It really varies, that's the thing it doesn't seem to be regional, I know people from my home town who are way worse the me.  I know people who are you know -- way better than me on that respect, too, so. 
02:21  02:23	FEMALE:  Now, which way is worse and which way is better in what you're saying?
02:24  02:31	MALE:  That's a good question, as I was saying that I was thinking hum, celebrate my national identity as someone who says out and out or sorry that kind of thing.
02:31  02:56	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Now, so I've worked on a variation as a language variationist and so the theory is the people that get the strongest local accent are the people that identify most strongly with the local area.  So you like being the type that goes off and goes to college is -- makes you less likely to have a strong accent.  You're going to use that source of local features, the less extent --.  The people like stick around and stay in town.
02:57  03:08	MALE:  That makes sense.  There are a few Canadian words that stick with me though.  Word choice garburator, which is a garbage disposal and Parkay [phonetic], I'm convinced Parkay needs to take off in the U.S.
03:09  03:09	FEMALE:  You seem --
03:10  03:11	MALE:  Parking structure or parking garage.
03:11  03:15	FEMALE:  Oh, not the butter.  You can't say Parkay because Parkay is the margarine.
03:16  03:18	MALE:  Parkay -- arca-dah.
03:19  03:19	FEMALE:  Arcade, oh.
03:20  03:21	MALE:  Like shopping at arcade, video arcade, car arcade.
03:22  03:24	FEMALE:  I like it.  It is, an elegant word.  Nicely done.
03:25  03:27	MALE:  Yeah, it's the first time.
03:28  03:33	FEMALE:  I'll see what I can do about that.  As a linguist, you know, we have a power with these sorts of things and we can --
03:34  03:42	MALE:  I really think it needs to propagate.  And the linguist stuff the other thing I have is, if a food is intentionally misspelled I refuse to eat it.  Frootloops.
03:43  03:43	FEMALE:  Ahh.
03:44  03:44	MALE:  Cheese Whiz.
03:45  03:48	FEMALE:  It's probably a good strategy actually.
03:49  03:52	MALE:  For the most part, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts is tough, because I really like them, but they spell the word doughnut correctly.
03:53  03:53	FEMALE:  Right.
03:54  03:57	MALE:  Not do-nuts.  So, I'm at a loss on that one.
03:58  04:02 	FEMALE:  That's probably the best health tip I've heard in a long time though.  Don't eat anything that is intentionally misspelled.  That will really cut out a lot of crap.
04:03  04:17	MALE:  It's helped me out with  Taco Bell, it advertises its grilled stuf'fd burrito that ticks me off, I don't know it just set me off.  I said, I'm not doing that, then again Taco Bell was an easy one to give up, so.
04:18  04:18	FEMALE:  But you did?
04:19  04:19	MALE:  Yeah, I persevered.
04:20  04:25	FEMALE:  Good.
04:26  04:27	MALE:  So, how did you like growing up in Cincinnati?
04:27  04:52	FEMALE:  I loved it, it was good.  A good place to grow up.  I tried to move back after college and it just wasn't the same, you know?  So it's not really -- it's a conservative city.  And you know to be an adult there is different.  But as a kid it was great.  You know, a lot of parks, a lot of land, big spread out city, so a converse city as far as the Midwest goes.  So you know it was good.
04:53  04:54	MALE:  Some time of chili.
04:55  05:00	FEMALE:  Exactly.  And it's great stuff.  I got -- I've gone vegetarian recently.
05:01  05:01	MALE:  I did that once.
05:02  05:19	FEMALE:  And so I've done it several times, but this time I'm going to stick with it.  But you know I can bear the thought of giving up Cincinnati chili -- that's just beyond the call of duty.  So I got some of those spice packets that they sell in Cincinnati actually and this week I'm going to try it with fake hamburger.
05:20  05:22	MALE:  I think in chili it would probably work --.  I went veggie for a year and I took then I took the Atkins diet.
05:23  05:23	FEMALE:  Yeah.
05:24  05:29	MALE:  I got like extreme.  But, ah, it was probably I gained 20 pounds, Atkins I lost 30, so go figure.
05:30  05:31	FEMALE:  You gained as a vegetarian?
05:31  05:38	MALE:  Oh yeah, it was like oh, instead of meat I'll just eat a block of cheese and some deep fried bread.  So I was a very bad vegetarian, very unhealthy one.  
05:39  05:39	FEMALE:  [laughter]
05:40  05:42	MALE:  But there's stuff with wheat gluten it's Sti Chin, something like that Sti --
05:43  05:43	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
05:44  05:46	MALE:  That stuff is really good fake beef, I've found.
05:47  05:51	FEMALE:  Okay.  Yeah, I mean I took my roommate to [horn] Trader Joes and have them bring out what's the substitutes.
05:52  05:55	MALE:  Country Sun is excellent too, the Country Sun store on California Avenue, tons of fake meat options, they are very good.
05:56  05:57	FEMALE:  Okay, good I'll check that out.  Good tip.  All right, male203 it was nice to meet you.
05:58  05:59	MALE:  Enjoyed, very nice meeting you as well.
06:01  06:02	FEMALE:  See ya soon.
