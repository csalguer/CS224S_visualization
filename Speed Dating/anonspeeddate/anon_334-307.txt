0:12 0:16 MALE: Nice to meet you, female334.  Whew.  How you holding up?
0:15 0:16 FEMALE: This is, like [laughter]--
0:17 0:17 MALE: [laughter]
0:17 0:18 FEMALE: You learn to be trained by the bell.
0:20 0:21 MALE: Yeah, it's really funny.
0:20 0:20 FEMALE: It's very, uh--
0:22 0:28 MALE: Pavlovian?  Um, so?
0:28 0:28 FEMALE: So how's it going?
0:30 0:31 MALE: It's going pretty well.  It's been interesting. 
0:31 0:31 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:32 0:37 MALE: It's kind of a funny way to get to know a bunch of people very little snippets.
0:34 0:36 FEMALE: Kind of like, "Hi [unintelligible].  All right.  Go."  
0:38 0:39 MALE: Yeah, exactly.
0:38 0:39 FEMALE: So where are you from, male307?
0:40 0:41 MALE: I'm from New York. 
0:40 0:40 FEMALE: New York. 
0:42 0:45 MALE: Uh, but I've been out here for about four years. 
0:44 0:44 FEMALE: Okay. 
0:46 0:47 MALE: I'm never going back to New York. 
0:46 0:48 FEMALE: No?  Why not?  Cold?
0:48 0:50 MALE: I'm never moving back there. 
0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Or the people, or--
0:51 1:08 MALE: It's not--it's not that I don't like anything there.  It's that I love it here.  Uh, I mean, I love New York.  My family's all back there, like, all my friends from college are there, basically, uh, and high school.  And, uh, and I just love the lifestyle out here.  I spend a lot of time outside playing and--
1:07 1:08 FEMALE: Yeah, they're very outdoorsy. 
1:10 1:21 MALE: Yeah.  It's very, like--it's a very cool culture.  Like, people are pretty relaxed, like, their work-life balance.  I was an investment banker in New York, so it's just, like, working 100-hour weeks and all that. 
1:20 1:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  So you were in the city, then?
1:23 1:25 MALE: Done with that. Yeah.  I was in the city. 
1:25 1:27 FEMALE: Are you in the MBA program here?
1:28 1:29 MALE: Yeah. Yes, I am.  
1:28 1:28 FEMALE: I see. 
1:30 1:34 MALE: Yeah.  When it's done--there's, like, three weeks left, which is kind of sad. 
1:33 1:36 FEMALE: Are you sad to be going or glad to be heading out into the workplace, or--
1:37 1:57 MALE: I'm sad.  I'm both.  Um, I'm not really heading out into the workforce exactly.  I'm trying to start a business.  So that's exciting, um, but I'm really sad to leave it because it's so much fun and relaxing.  No real-life pressures.  Just, like, all these little pressures that are made up.  So that's been fun. 
1:57 1:59 FEMALE: So do you want to continue with the investment banking then?
2:00 2:06 MALE: No, no, no.  I want to try, try and start a business.  Kind of a health, health and wellness field. 
2:05 2:07 FEMALE: Well, that's kind of what I'm doing.  I'm, uh--
2:08 2:09 MALE: Oh, really?  What are you doing?
2:08 2:09 FEMALE: I'm in immunology.
2:10 2:11 MALE: Oh, interesting. 
2:10 2:12 FEMALE: So, yeah, studying how, like, the immune system--
2:13 2:13 MALE: Wow.
2:12 2:18 FEMALE: Responds to, um, uh, like, diseases and different illnesses you get. 
2:20 2:20 MALE: Very interesting.  
2:20 2:20 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:21 2:26 MALE: Do you study at all, uh, how lifestyle affects your immune system responses?
2:26 2:28 FEMALE: I don't personally, but I think people do that. 
2:29 2:30 MALE: Yeah, yeah. 
2:28 2:30 FEMALE: Kind of, like, psychological immunology. 
2:30 2:30 MALE: Yeah. 
2:31 2:36 FEMALE: Where they look and see how your, um, mental state--like, how you're feeling or--fitness--
2:35 2:41 MALE: And even things like fitness level, and, like, nutrition and things like that?  That's kind of what we're working on. 
2:39 2:41 FEMALE: They do study that.  Um--
2:42 2:43 MALE: But that's--but that's not your area of focus?
2:42 2:45 FEMALE: No, no.  I'm, I'm looking at how the immune system develops. 
2:46 2:47 MALE: Yeah, oh, wow. 
2:46 2:59 FEMALE: Like, how it decides what's foreign and, like, uh, what, um--and what yourself is so that you don't get different autoimmune diseases like diabetes or multiple sclerosis where the immune system attacks the self. 
3:00 3:04 MALE: Interesting.  So this is a biology PhD? 
3:03 3:05 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Actually, it's immunology, but--
3:06 3:08 MALE: Oh, it's specific--it's a separate field?  Okay.
3:07 3:10 FEMALE: Yeah.  Over the in the medical school, they've got, like, 13 different--
3:11 3:12 MALE: Gotcha.  Yeah, I, I--
3:10 3:12 FEMALE: Biology-related [unintelligible]. 
3:12 3:19 MALE: I'm still back at, like, college when everything's just kind of dumped under Bio.  It's all--that's pretty neat.  What--
3:18 3:28 FEMALE: Yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty cool [unintelligible].  Uh, so where are you from?  Um, did you go to under grad in New York or--
3:27 3:30 MALE: No, it's, uh--I went to Penn under grad. 
3:29 3:30 FEMALE: Penn?  Okay. 
3:31 3:33 MALE: Yeah, so I was in Philly for four years. 
3:32 3:33 FEMALE: Did you like Philadelphia?
3:34 3:51 MALE: Yeah.  I, uh, I wouldn't want to live there now, but I had a great experience for the four years that I was there.  It was definitely a lot of fun, and the school itself I loved.  Like, I met--you know, some of my best friends now are people I met there, so it's hard not to have good feelings about it. 
3:50 3:56 FEMALE: So I hear they're putting in a wireless throughout the city of Philadelphia.  Is it Philadelphia [unintelligible].
3:56 4:02 MALE: I haven't kept up with it, so it's very possible.  Like, uh, like a Wi-fi network?
4:02 4:02 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Through the--
4:03 4:04 MALE: That's pretty neat.
4:03 4:05 FEMALE: I'm not sure how far out it would extend, but--
4:06 4:09 MALE: I know that [unintelligible] talk about--wow.  That was quite loud.  
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: That's getting louder, isn't it?
4:10 4:10 MALE: Yeah.
4:10 4:10 FEMALE: I think it is.
