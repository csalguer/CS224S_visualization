0:01 0:02 FEMALE: Hello, male308.
0:05 0:06 MALE: Okay.  I'm getting quicker and better at this.  
0:03 0:05 FEMALE: I know, I'm still lagging, I'm sorry.  
0:08 0:10 MALE: Oh, please, take your time.  Yeah, yeah, not problem.
0:05 0:15 FEMALE: Give me- give me a sec.  [laughter]  Mmm.  Oh, Romeo.  So, male308.  
0:18 0:22 MALE: Well, I'm like, I feel like, I mean, have, did we go to undergrad together, as well?
0:19 0:19 FEMALE: Yes, we did.  
0:23 0:24 MALE: I knew it, social dance, right?
0:21 0:26 FEMALE: [laughter]  I did, I do do social dance, but I don't, that's not how I know you, uh, you were my FA.
0:29 0:30 MALE: Ah, oh.  
0:27 0:27 FEMALE: [laughter]
0:31 0:31 MALE: Did you live at Carruthers?
0:29 0:31 FEMALE: I, no, no, I lived in Kastine [phonetic]
0:34 0:38 MALE: And, I'm sorry, I live at Carruthers now, it's not asking this [unintelligible] Are you-- ?
0:36 0:37 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:40 0:42 MALE: Well, I'm very embarassed about that, because-- 
0:39 0:41 FEMALE: You should be, you were my staff member.
0:44 0:46 MALE: Well, I guess I wasn't a very good one, wow.
0:43 0:44 FEMALE: Apparently not.  [laughter]
0:47 0:50 MALE: So did you go straight through, I mean, you're in the med school, right?
0:46 0:51 FEMALE: So, I'm doing M.D./Ph.D.  So, I'm med school starting my Ph.D. this summer, so--
0:54 0:55 MALE: What's your Ph.D. in?
0:52 0:52 FEMALE: Neuroscience.  
0:56 0:57 MALE: That's sweet.
0:54 0:56 FEMALE: It'll be fun, it'll be very fun.
0:58 1:00 MALE: This is pretty darn impressive.  Did you go straight through?
0:58 1:03 FEMALE: I did go straight through.  Which kind of compensates for the fact that I, you know, will be in school for like 12 years, so-- 
1:06 1:06 MALE: Yeah.
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: Stanford--
1:07 1:09 MALE: That's a very good point.  Right, you're taking--
1:06 1:07 FEMALE: Take time off--
1:10 1:11 MALE: Totally forget about it.
1:08 1:09 FEMALE: You know, just get [unintelligible]
1:12 1:15 MALE: And here's to your, so you're one year into med school, you finished your first year?
1:12 1:16 FEMALE: So I just finished my second year, and I'm doing now my Ph.D. and then last two years.
1:19 1:23 MALE: So we're on the same track, except that you're, for now we part ways, and you're in school for-- 
1:19 1:19 FEMALE: [laughter]  
1:23 1:24 MALE: --ever, and I'm not.
1:21 1:24 FEMALE: Right, exactly, [unintelligible] how exciting.
1:26 1:27 MALE: That's cool.  How you liking the med school?
1:26 1:35 FEMALE: As much as one can, given the circumstances.  It's one of those things where it's intense, there's a lot of data that has to be, information that has to be committed to memory, and that's kind of modest [unintelligible]
1:38 1:40 MALE: You, and you have to do the boards and all that, just like--
1:37 1:42 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm studying for that, no, it's lovely.  It's- it's great.
1:44 1:50 MALE: Wow.  So what about all your clinical stuff?  Do they cut you some slack since you're doing the whole Ph.D., I mean do you still do all that? 
1:45 2:03 FEMALE: No, you still have to do last years.  You have to do like the full medical program.  The only thing I will say, trying to Ph-- your Ph.D., you don't have to do rotations.  So, like the first two, basically the idea is that you will kind of try out different labs in your first years of med school, so then you can just kind of get started with your work, as opposed to kind of spending a whole year feeling things out.  So you stay over a year there, but it's pretty much solo.
2:07 2:13 MALE: I guess I assumed sort of, [unintelligible] I mean, that's rotations would be, you know, sort of you're going to-- are you like-- 
2:09 2:11 FEMALE: Yeah, I do know, I have a lab chosen.
2:13 2:19 MALE: --a research post, um, down the roa, when you finish it, do you just want to do research, or do you also-- ?
2:16 2:21 FEMALE: Probably mostly research, maybe some component of like practicing medicine, but we'll see.
2:24 2:26 MALE: Oh, so you don't need the res- the rotations.
2:23 2:27 FEMALE: We'll see, we'll see how it works.  So are you doing law school now, is that the idea?
2:29 2:30 MALE: It's [unintelligible]  I'm loving it.  
2:28 2:28 FEMALE: Really?
2:31 2:33 MALE: So, but I have one more year, and I think it's--
2:30 2:30 FEMALE: [laughter]
2:34 2:37 MALE: I don't know if you having this experience, but-- I mean, 'cause you're halfway through med school.
2:34 2:35 FEMALE: Right, right.
2:38 2:39 MALE: It's just gone so quick, you know.
2:37 2:37 FEMALE: Yeah, it is.
2:40 2:42 MALE: I was so excited at coming back here.
2:39 2:39 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:42 2:42 MALE: And just-- 
2:40 2:42 FEMALE: What did you do with like-- You took time off, right?
2:45 2:46 MALE: I worked for Microsoft for two years.
2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Oh, right.
2:46 2:50 MALE: In product management management, which I really liked.  And actually, [unintelligible], you remember him?  
2:47 2:47 FEMALE: Right, of course.
2:50 2:58 MALE: [unintelligible] came up there to work for, I want to say Amazon, or one of the companies in town, um, just as I was leaving.  And so--
2:56 2:56 FEMALE: You say you ran into him or-- ?
2:59 3:00 MALE: And nameX [unintelligible] came up there--
2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Really?
3:02 3:02 MALE: You remember him?
2:59 3:00 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, I do remember him.
3:03 3:06 MALE: You know, those people that-- He's a very good friend of mine, but-- [laughter]
3:01 3:04 FEMALE: You just don't forget-- you don't forget nameX [unintelligible], no. 
3:07 3:12 MALE: I'll have to tell him that, that's fantastic.  He's great, but he does leave a lasting impression.
3:09 3:12 FEMALE: Indeed he does.  [laughter]  Very cool.
3:14 3:16 MALE: [laughter]  Well, but he was a lot of fun.  But--
3:13 3:13 FEMALE: That's awesome.
3:16 3:18 MALE: I decided this was more for me.
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Right.
3:19 3:20 MALE: Where are you from before um Stanford?
3:17 3:18 FEMALE: I'm from Croatia originally.  
3:21 3:23 MALE: Right.  Did you come out, straight for college, or were you-- ?
3:20 3:22 FEMALE: I did.  For college, so when I was 18.  
3:25 3:26 MALE: Do you get back at all?
3:23 3:39 FEMALE: I went last summer, the summer before, and then couple years before, but like, you know, it can't go that much, because you know, just like, it's expensive, it's far, it doesn't really make sense to like really go for much longer than like two weeks, and there, you know, it's kind of like with the jet lag and everything, it just doens't end up being worthwhile.  
3:42 3:45 MALE: It's too tough, [unintelligible] would be, like for your family and everything?
3:42 3:51 FEMALE: Actually, all mostly here, because my sister is in San Francisco, my parents are staying with her now, and my brother's in Chicago, so you know, I'm much closer to my family than many people, you know.  
3:52 3:54 MALE: Yeah, [unintelligible] yeah, that's awesome.
3:51 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  There are reasons to go back, like some high school friends and very beautiful beaches and things along that sorts.  But-- 
3:59 4:06 MALE: Oh, I've heard that.  Actually from nameX, he did a semester at sea-- [horn] oh, yeah, [unintelligible] and he showed me pictures.
4:04 4:04 FEMALE: It's gorgeous.  
4:08 4:10 MALE: Wow, anyway it was really good seeing you.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE: Cool.  Good seeing you again.
4:10 4:12 MALE: I'm completely embarassed about forgetting--
4:08 4:10 FEMALE: [laughter]  I do-- 
4:13 4:16 MALE: I'll know and if you ever see Luis or Charlene-- 
4:14 4:15 FEMALE: I'll say hi.  
4:18 4:19 MALE: Would you?
4:16 4:18 FEMALE: Oh, do I?  Not very frequently, no.  
4:21 4:26 MALE: You know, the [unintelligible] [whispering]
