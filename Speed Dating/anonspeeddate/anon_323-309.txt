1:49 1:50 FEMALE: This is a good place to spend your youth.
1:53 1:54 MALE: I like the environment a lot. I like the weather here a lot, too.
1:55 1:56 FEMALE: What do you do in your free time?
1:59 2:03 MALE: I enjoy music. I either listen to music or sing karaoke.
2:04 2:06 FEMALE: Oh. You like karaoke. Do you do that in San Francisco?
2:07 2:10 MALE: Actually no, there are some karaoke places in Sunnyvale or Freemont.
2:11 2:12 FEMALE: Oh. That's interesting.
2:13 2:13 MALE: Because San Francisco is kind of far.
2:13 2:15 FEMALE: It is sort of far. So where do you live?
2:16 2:17 MALE: I live on campus in EV.
2:17 2:18 FEMALE: Oh. In EV?
2:19 2:19 MALE: Yeah.
2:19 2:21 FEMALE: All right. Have you done speed dating before?
2:21 2:22 MALE: Yeah. Once.	
2:22 2:22 FEMALE: Did you do it at the EV thing?
2:23 2:26 MALE: No, no, no. It's not EV, it was in San Francisco actually.
2:26 2:27 FEMALE: Okay. And how did it work out for you?
2:29 2:29 MALE: No.
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: No? [laughter]
2:30 2:40 MALE: No. I think people there, they have-- people who attend those speed dating things are really less educated.
2:40 2:41 FEMALE: Less educated, oh, is that a problem for you?
2:42 2:48 MALE: Yeah. That's kind of a problem because they really don't have much of the same language to--
2:50 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah. That's true, they can't talk about what you like and what you know about.
2:53 2:55 MALE: Yeah. So it wouldn't help.	
2:56 2:58 FEMALE: All right. Well it's nice to meet new people anyway.
2:59 3:02 MALE: Yup, yup. And I think the speed dating itself is interesting, too.
3:03 3:05 FEMALE: It is. It's sort of bizarre but it's fun.
3:06 3:06 MALE: It's bizarre but it's fun, yeah.
3:06 3:11 FEMALE: It's interesting. So do you have any plans for the summer, are you going to be working?
3:12 3:22 MALE: Plans for this summer? Not yet because I need to attend a conference in the beginning of August, so probably in July I need to prepare the presentation.
3:23 3:24 FEMALE: So do you have any time off?
3:25 3:30 MALE: Well actually my time is scheduled by myself pretty much.	
3:30 3:30 FEMALE: So you can have time off anytime?
3:32 3:32 MALE: So I can decide when. Yeah, yeah. I can take time off whenever I want.
3:34 3:39 FEMALE: You're going to miss that when you go to the real world and start working, probably.
3:39 3:40 MALE: So what do you do in your spare time, for you?
3:41 3:44 FEMALE: I do a lot of hiking. I like playing tennis. I like being outside.
3:45 3:45 MALE: Playing tennis?
3:46 3:47 FEMALE: Uh-huh. So.
3:47 3:50 MALE: Hiking. Where do you go hiking?
3:51 4:12 FEMALE: I do the dish a couple of times a week and I also like going to state parks around here like Castle Rock and that's pretty much it. I used to live in Camble and I would go to Freemont Older. But now I like doing the dish mostly because it's pretty close. It was nice to meet.
4:13 4:13 MALE: It was nice to meet you, same here.
4:14 4:14 FEMALE: Take care.
4:14 4:14 MALE: Take care.
