0:54 0:54 FEMALE: Oh, okay.

2:25 2:25 FEMALE: Oh, that's cool.

2:26 2:29 MALE: - [unintelligible], and then had a weird chance to come here, and I figured I might as well take it.

2:30 2:32 FEMALE: Oh, okay, so is this your first time in California, or...?

2:32 2:36 MALE: It really is, well, it was one of the first times out of the state of Colorado, [unintelligible].

3:49 3:53 FEMALE: Oh, cool.  Will you want to stay in the area, after you're -

3:55 3:55 FEMALE: You like the area?

3:55 3:55 MALE: So I would - 

3:56 3:57 FEMALE: No more Colorado?

3:58 4:01 MALE: Well, I'll eventually maybe when I get older like to go home, go back to the farm --
