0:01 0:04 FEMALE: I know.  Oh, goodness.
0:19 0:20 MALE: I guess we can start. 
0:08 0:08 FEMALE: Yes. 
0:21 0:22 MALE: So, tell me about yourself. 
0:10 0:12 FEMALE: Well, first let me say my name is female335.
0:25 0:25 MALE: Yeah. 
0:13 0:21 FEMALE: And, uh, I was born in--well, I'm raised--I was raised in Sacramento, and I went to Stanford for college.  I graduated in 2002.
0:34 0:35 MALE: Oh, I went here in '99.
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: Oh, yeah?
0:35 0:36 MALE: Yeah. 
0:23 0:27 FEMALE: Oh, sweet.  And then I, uh, went straight through to a PhD in biology. 
0:40 0:41 MALE: Oh, in Bio.  Okay. 
0:28 0:30 FEMALE: Yeah.  And, uh, I was a math major under grad.
0:43 0:44 MALE: Well, that's a big change.
0:32 0:36 FEMALE: Yeah, kind of.  I study, uh, theoretical biology now.  Evolution. 
0:49 0:49 MALE: Oh, cool. 
0:37 0:41 FEMALE: So that's what I do.  But I'm enjoying just living on campus.  And that's kind of the nuts and bolts about me. 
0:53 0:54 MALE: Awesome.  Well, my name's male315 [phonetic].  Um, I was in Stanford in '99, like I said.  I went, uh--I worked in New York for a couple years, and then I went to Paris and worked [unintelligible] for about four years. 
0:51 0:52 FEMALE: That's great. 
1:04 1:06 MALE: And now I'm back.  I'm a first year at the business school.
0:54 0:55 FEMALE: How are you liking the business school?
1:08 1:09 MALE: I'm having a good time. 
0:56 0:56 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:09 1:10 MALE: It's a lot of fun, so-- 
0:57 1:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  It seems like a lot of people come back for business school.
1:13 1:17 MALE: Uh, yeah.  There's--we're the largest group at the business school, that's for sure.  It goes Stanford, Harvard then Princeton.  
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:18 1:19 MALE: And then Dartmouth.  So--
1:06 1:08 FEMALE: I think Stanford's probably one of those places where you tend to come back. 
1:21 1:24 MALE: You tend to come back.  Exactly, yeah.  So where are you originally from?
1:12 1:16 FEMALE: Sacramento.  I mean, my family's from India.  I was born in North Carolina, though. So--
1:29 1:33 MALE: [unintelligible] I'm from San Diego, originally, but I haven't really lived there in a while, so-- 
1:20 1:20 FEMALE: Um hm. 
1:34 1:36 MALE: And so where do you live now?
1:23 1:28 FEMALE: I live on campus still.  It's so convenient.  Um, I live in the studios. 
1:41 1:43 MALE: I didn't know there was grad-student housing studios.  
1:31 1:32 FEMALE: Um hm.  Yeah. 
1:45 1:46 MALE: Is that in the--oh, no, I'm thinking of the suites. 
1:33 1:34 FEMALE: Yes, yeah. 
1:47 1:48 MALE: Where are the studios?
1:36 1:38 FEMALE: The one I live in is next to Miralees [phonetic].  So--
1:51 1:53 MALE: Oh, is it, like, [unintelligible] or--
1:38 1:44 FEMALE: It's kind of close to under grads.  No, it's right in front.  It's a studio apartment, so it's just--you can live by yourself.
1:57 1:58 MALE: Is it kind of part of EV?
1:45 1:45 FEMALE: It's part of EV.
1:58 2:00 MALE: Oh, it's part of EV. I see.
1:46 1:47 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:00 2:02 MALE: It's not the big, tall building is it, or--
1:49 1:52 FEMALE: Not the high rises.  They're, they're little.  They're about four floors tall.
2:06 2:09 MALE: Cool.  So you're there for your full--how many years do you have left?  Four years, or--
1:56 1:57 FEMALE: Just one more, actually.
2:10 2:10 MALE: Oh, wow. 
1:58 1:58 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:12 2:13 MALE: So you're done taking classes, you're writing your thesis?
2:00 2:02 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm working on my dissertation now. 
2:16 2:16 MALE: Awesome. 
2:03 2:04 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:17 2:18 MALE: Well, good luck on that. 
2:05 2:05 FEMALE: Oh, thanks.
2:19 2:21 MALE: Um, what are you thinking of doing with that afterwards?  Do you--academics?
2:08 2:15 FEMALE: Yeah, I want to go into academia. Um, but I'm kind of looking forward to moving away from Stanford.  That's sort of my goal after grad school.
2:29 2:30 MALE: Try something new probably.
2:17 2:18 FEMALE: Yeah, moving to a new city and stuff.
2:31 2:33 MALE: Because you went straight through.  You didn't take a year off or--
2:20 2:21 FEMALE: No.  No, straight through. 
2:35 2:35 MALE: Wow.
2:23 2:30 FEMALE: Yeah.  I think--I mean, it was the right decision at the time, but now I'm ready for something new.  So how did you like living abroad?
2:43 2:48 MALE: I had a great time.  I went just for one year, and I ended up staying for four years.  So it's a pretty good endorsement of it, so-- 
2:35 2:46 FEMALE: Wow.  That's great.  I lived--uh, my parents were--they're professors in Sacramento, and we lived in Germany, um, when I was in junior high.  I went to school there, and I've always wanted to go back.  Um--
2:58 3:00 MALE: To Ger--where in Germany were you?
2:47 2:48 FEMALE: In Regensburg, in Bavaria?
3:01 3:03 MALE: Oh, okay.  Bavaria's a lot of fun. 
2:50 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  It was a nice place.
3:04 3:07 MALE: And a little less uptight than the rest of [unintelligible]. 
2:54 2:58 FEMALE: [laughter].  The north is very different.  I like Bavaria.  Yeah. 
3:11 3:16 MALE: Exactly, yeah.  Cool.  And, uh, and so what is your dissertation on?
3:03 3:17 FEMALE: Um, well, I study the relationship between genetic differences between human populations and geography.  Um, so basically you can kind of predict, based on the geographic distance between indigenous populations, their genetic similarities and dissimilarities. 
3:31 3:31 MALE: Uh huh.
3:19 3:41 FEMALE: Which is kind of interesting.  Uh, another thing I study is differences across genetic systems.  Um, for example, like, how you expect people to differ, looking at their X chromosome versus their Y chromosome versus their non-sex chromosomes.  Because, uh, the different parts of the genome have different histories, and that's kind of a big problem that you want to understand in evolution. 
3:53 3:55 MALE: I see. 
3:42 3:52 FEMALE: Uh, for example, like, the Y chromosome, which you can trace through your paternal lineages, appears to be a lot older than the mitochondrial genome, which you can trace through maternal lineages. 
4:05 4:05 MALE: Um hm.
3:52 3:57 FEMALE: And so this is a question that a lot of people are trying to resolve.  Why is it [unintelligible]?
4:09 4:11 MALE: Which means that men have been around longer?
3:58 4:02 FEMALE: Well, maybe.  Maybe not.  Probably not. 
4:14 4:18 MALE: [laughter] I wouldn't--it would jive with the Bible, which we're all looking to do, so--
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: Right, right. 
4:20 4:21 MALE: I don't know.  Well, it was nice meeting you.
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: It was nice meeting you, too. [laughter]
