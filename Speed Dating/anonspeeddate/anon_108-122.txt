0:03 0:04 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:04 0:05 MALE:  Yeah, that's good.
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Oh okay.  So like --
0:07 0:10 MALE:  Okay.  So what department are you from?
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  Genetics.
0:11 0:14 MALE:  Okay.  The new bio or something like that?
0:14 0:17 FEMALE:  We're not in the Cool Center.  I'm in the hospital building.
0:17 0:19 MALE:  Oh the [unintelligible]?
0:20 0:20 FEMALE:  So --
0:20 0:22 MALE:  That's what I heard about [unintelligible].
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  We're [unintelligible].
0:24 0:25 MALE:  Oh, sorry.
0:25 0:28 FEMALE:  No, no, that's okay.  We're in one of the older buildings.
0:28 0:29 MALE:  Oh.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  We're just right across the way.
0:30 0:30 MALE:  Uh huh.
0:31 0:34 FEMALE:  Yeah, but how about you?  What program are you?
0:34 0:35 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:35 0:35 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:36 0:39 MALE:  [unintelligible].  And you are doing a [unintelligible] I guess?
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, Ph.D. first year.
0:41 0:43 MALE:  Uh huh.  Oh first year, okay.
0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  I'll be here for awhile.
0:45 0:50 MALE:  Uh huh.  So how was the first year in Genetics?  Like is it hard?  You have to take a lot of classes?
0:51 0:55 FEMALE:  Not, we're not doing Masters so its not intense classes.
0:56 0:56 MALE:  Oh.
0:57 1:06 FEMALE:  So it's mostly [unintelligible] classes, rotating a couple of different labs.  Spend the first year deciding what lab you want to join so at the end of this year I can chose which lab I'm going to join.  And then [unintelligible].
1:07 1:11 MALE:  Have you heard of this, you might not, [unintelligible] college at Houston?
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:13 1:24 MALE:  Okay, well actually I have somebody who actually is now the second year who has all this, probably the same thing she used to rotate through the labs and then she had to decide which lab she was going to be.
1:24 1:25 FEMALE:  Was she biology as well?
1:25 1:27 MALE:  Yeah, she's microbiology.
1:27 1:30 FEMALE:  Okay, I think a lot of sciences do that, or at least biology.
1:31 1:31 MALE:  Yeah.
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:33 1:34 MALE:  They take microbiology, too.
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, okay.
1:35 1:42 MALE:  Well we don't have that in [unintelligible].  [unintelligible] otherwise you go for five years from one lab to another and you won't find everything.
1:43 1:49 FEMALE:  Yeah so we got to choose which [unintelligible] we wanted to rotate in and then we'll choose between the three which one you want.
1:49 1:58 MALE:  Oh, which one you pick.  Okay.  So is there a lot of competition; like are you sure to get the one that you want or like?
1:58 2:00 FEMALE:  Most likely there are more professors than there are students.
2:01 2:02 MALE:  Oh.
2:02 2:03 FEMALE:  There are only six first year students.
2:03 2:04 MALE:  Okay.
2:05 2:07 FEMALE:  So it shouldn't be a problem to get into class.
2:07 2:13 MALE:  So what's your department size?  What's the department size like they take six course years?
2:14 2:28 FEMALE:  Well, ours isn't [unintelligible].  I think the average is eight to 10 first years coming in and there are 14 primary appointments [unintelligible] for Genetics.  A total of 25 or something.
2:29 2:30 MALE:  Okay.
2:31 2:33 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] Genetics lab and then about 50 students in this program right now.
2:34 2:47 MALE:  Okay so if you count for six years, it's like 150 or something right?  Like for the person comes in, he leaves after six years.  So that would be 25 each year right?  [unintelligible].
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  Well like 10 each year.
2:50 2:52 MALE:  Okay.  So only 60.
2:52 2:55 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not big.
2:55 2:58 MALE:  Like the Engineering Department takes 200 graduates through every year.
2:59 3:01 FEMALE:  But most are Masters.  Is that right?
3:02 3:09 MALE:  Uh [unintelligible] students and one would be a Masters.  So at least they get [unintelligible] students every year.
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  Wow.  [laughter]  Okay.
3:12 3:18 MALE:  And the facility are not so many.  Like each faculty has six or seven students and like its crazy.
3:19 3:22 FEMALE:  Wow.  So how many people are in your, is it a lab?
3:22 3:23 MALE:  Yeah, there's a group you can stay in.
3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:25 3:40 MALE:  Yeah.  It's eight, but I do more [unintelligible] jobs, so 10.  And yeah, it's a problem.  Okay, so what are you doing in your free time or something like that?  What would you like to do?
3:41 3:51 FEMALE:  I really like outdoor stuff.  So now that the weather is nice, I'm loving this.  Being outside hiking or driving, going to the beach.  [unintelligible] running.
3:52 3:55 MALE:  Uh huh.  Okay.  Good.
3:58 3:59 FEMALE:  That's it.
