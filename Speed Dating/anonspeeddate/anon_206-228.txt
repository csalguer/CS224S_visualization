1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:42 1:51 MALE:  And like he's like this very ordinary, average, like, usual guy.  But all of these bizarre things happen to him and he gradually becomes more and more bizarre.

1:52 1:52 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:35 2:35 MALE:  No, no.

2:35 2:39 FEMALE:  It's just kind of so interesting to me that something like that could get to spiraled out of control.

2:40 2:41 MALE:  Yeah, when did it happen, like what year?

2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  '84 I think, early '80s.

2:44 2:48 MALE:  I guess these-I mean, it's people like that that give the Mormons, I guess a bad rep, I guess.  I don't know.  [laughter].

2:50 2:56 MALE:  Yeah, I don't know anything about it either just, you know, what people say, you know.

3:28 3:29 MALE:  So, you mountain climb.

3:29 3:35 FEMALE:  You know to be honest, I'm --I'm not--I've never climbed a mountain, so I don't know [unintelligible] if it's something I'm going to be [unintelligible].

3:35 3:35 MALE:  [laughter].

3:36 3:43 FEMALE:  But I'm going to give it a shot.  There is seven of us from my class that are going to go, so I figured why not.  This is probably the only time that I'll--at least [unintelligible] to go to Africa, right?

3:44 3:44 MALE:  Yeah.
