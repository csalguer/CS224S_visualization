0:00:04.3  0:00:07.8  MALE:  Oh boy.  You can begin talking now, actually. 
0:00:07.2  0:00:13.1  FEMALE:  Basically somebody ahead of you--you know you were talking to me.  It's nice that you're all laid back and stuff.  That's cool.  
0:00:13.7  0:00:13.8  MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:00:14.0  0:00:22.9  FEMALE:  Because like somebody else ahead of you or whatever, like a couple dudes ahead of you, was like, "Don't talk."  And I was like, "Oh shit.  Sorry."  And then like I said shit and it's like bad.  Girls shouldn't say that [laughter]. 
0:00:23.0  0:00:27.6  MALE:  [unintelligible] I'm downgrading on the curteous line  here for using a swear word.
0:00:27.2  0:00:28.3  FEMALE:  Thanks. 
0:00:28.8  0:00:31.6  MALE:  It's only appropriate.  So what's going on? 
0:00:31.0  0:00:33.6  FEMALE:  What school am I in? 
0:00:33.9  0:00:34.8  MALE:  I said what's going on? 
0:00:34.4  0:00:35.3  FEMALE:  Oh, what's going on.  Oh. 
0:00:35.9  0:00:36.7  MALE:  Yeah.  How you doing? 
0:00:36.1  0:00:37.0  FEMALE:  I'm pretty good. 
0:00:37.4  0:00:38.2  MALE:  Are you having fun with this so far? 
0:00:37.7  0:00:39.2  FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm just running on low sleep because I--
0:00:42.1  0:00:42.5  MALE:  [interposing] oh really.  What have you been working on? 
0:00:41.4  0:00:43.9  FEMALE:  Master's project. 
0:00:44.5  0:00:45.3  MALE:  Oh.
0:00:44.8  0:00:49.6  FEMALE:  Education.  Qualitative research on um, admissions politics. 
0:00:50.3  0:00:53.6  MALE:  How interesting.  Here at Stanford or in general.
0:00:53.7  0:00:56.0  FEMALE:  In general but I've got some sources from other schools.
0:00:56.7  0:01:05.3  MALE:  Like admission politics like I know somebody at this school but I'm a fringe canidate so someone makes a phone call and I get let in or not, that kind of stuff? 
0:01:05.0  0:01:20.6  FEMALE:  Actually, specifically looking at the demographic is the women of color at the grad level, doctorals and humanities.  And um, I interviewed two um, admissions board faculty from another school who have experience screening those types of applications.
0:01:21.1  0:01:21.8  MALE:  Okay. 
0:01:21.0  0:01:28.6  FEMALE:  And they gave me feedback on five statements of purpose [unintelligible] women of color did apply to it given doctoral humanitites program. 
0:01:29.1  0:01:33.4  MALE:  So what, what, what is your like thesis about people in these situation? 
0:01:33.5  0:01:38.9  FEMALE:  Um, my thesis was uncovering what challanges do they face.  And I came to the conclusion--
0:01:39.3  0:01:44.4  MALE:  [interposing] addmiting these people or deciding on whether to admit these people or not?  Or people coming into these programs? 
0:01:44.7  0:01:46.8  FEMALE:  Um, deciding on the people. 
0:01:47.2  0:01:47.9  MALE:  Oh, deciding.  Yeah 
0:01:48.1  0:02:15.7  FEMALE:  It, it was kind of like--because there's a situation that I read in some literature here required for our paper to like read up on stuff um, and add it as a literary veiw.  And there's this one section I read that was really interesting to me because um, this one African-American humanities professor said, "When I was"  she said, "When I was  a doctoral student I felt this pressure to decide between um, you know, doing something that's marketable, traditional literature canons--" 
0:02:15.7  0:02:16.1  MALE:  [interposing]  yeah.
0:02:16.4  0:02:19.5  FEMALE:  --"or do, just because I'm black do black literature." 
0:02:19.6  0:02:20.1  MALE:  Um-hmm. 
0:02:20.3  0:02:21.9  FEMALE:  Because that would be marketable. 
0:02:22.3  0:02:23.2  MALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:23.4  0:02:29.9  FEMALE:  They would like think I would be more marketable that way or something.  So I just thought that was interesting, specialization choice pressures. 
0:02:30.7  0:02:31.5  MALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:31.0  0:02:31.2  FEMALE:  But um--
0:02:32.3  0:02:38.5  MALE:  [interposing] so anyway, that's [unintelligible] you figured out at school or it drove you to want a new master's and study that kind of stuff? 
0:02:38.2  0:02:46.0  FEMALE:  Well I wasn't really conscious of being the only one of my admicity [phonetic] in any--all my classes like here and other grad program, another grad program I was in--
0:02:46.6  0:02:50.4  MALE:  [interposing] yeah.  So just something you've thought about. 
0:02:50.9  0:02:57.3  FEMALE:  Yeah.  It was based off of personal intrigue.  And then I realized I could like, really invest a lot in it by--I mean--
0:02:57.7  0:02:59.0  MALE:  [interposing] you could do some meaningful work on it basically. 
0:02:58.8  0:03:02.5  FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah what school are you in? 
0:03:02.4  0:03:03.6  MALE:  I'm in the B school. 
0:03:03.3  0:03:04.2  FEMALE:  You're in the B school. 
0:03:04.6  0:03:08.4  MALE:  A few of my predicessors [phonetic] that I see have moved on ahead,  Metcalf [phonetic]. 
0:03:08.1  0:03:09.0  FEMALE:  Yes.
0:03:09.7  0:03:45.8  MALE:  He's a good buddy of mine.  Yeah.  This is my year.  And I'm, I'm probably going to um, [unintelligible] company this summer in San Francisco.  And it's fun.  I mean, it's--I think it's a lot different than a lot of other departmensts.  It's really social, kind of de-emphasis on meeting people and getting to know people less so they're not finding a hard academic pursuit or science or that sort of thing.  I went--I was a history major in undergrad at Princeton.  It was definately 180 degrees different, you know. 
0:03:45.5  0:03:46.0  FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:03:45.8  0:04:03.6  MALE:  Kind of academic [unintelligible].  Which is refreshing, you know.  You have two years to kind of like think about your career, think about where you want to go.  Meet a lot of people and learn a lot about their industries and stuff.  So it's been fun.  I mean, I'm moving off campus next year so I'm going to miss--I like being on campus.  You live on campus?
0:04:02.9  0:04:04.2  FEMALE:  Um-hmm.  Yeah.  I live at Rains.
0:04:05.2  0:04:12.3  MALE:  Oh.  It's nice to like walk through the commons.  It's like you have that college feel, sort of being a member of the community. 
0:04:11.7  0:04:12.1  FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:04:12.3  0:04:14.9  MALE:  So I worry that when I move off campus next year that I'll--
0:04:15.3  0:04:15.4  FEMALE:  Whoa. 
0:04:16.1  0:04:20.6  MALE:  Loose my hearing.  No, I mean, So, yeah.  Well it was nice to meet you. 
0:04:20.5  0:04:21.4  FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:04:22.4  0:04:23.0  MALE:  You have a good evening.
0:04:22.6  0:04:23.6  FEMALE:  Thank you.  You too.
