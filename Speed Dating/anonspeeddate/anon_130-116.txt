0:00 0:01 MALE:  So, I'm male116.  
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  female130.  Nice to meet you.  
0:03 0:06 MALE:  And what program are you in?  
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Philosophy.  
0:07 0:08 MALE:  Philosophy, okay.  
0:09 0:10 FEMALE:  And what program are you?  
0:09 0:10 MALE:  Political science.  
0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  Ah, and tell me what are you doing?  
0:14 0:19 MALE:  Doing American politics sort of political institutions, but not sure exactly what. 
0:20 0:23 FEMALE:  You are second year?  
0:22 0:23 MALE:  First year.  
0:24 0:26 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
0:27 0:31 MALE:  It goes fast though, yeah.  Did you ever see nameX?  Have you met him?  
0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  Who?  
0:33 0:35 MALE:  nameX--do you know him?  He does a lot of philosophy.  
0:36 0:44 FEMALE:  I might know his name.  I see his name, and I think he is right now coming to a class that I am taking.  
0:44 0:46 MALE:  Oh, really?  That's very possible.  
0:46 0:53 FEMALE:  Yes, he might be the one. I don't know.  Do you know the [unintelligible]?  
0:53 0:58 MALE:  Long hair, pony tail?  Okay, so where are you from?  
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  Romania.  
1:00 1:12 MALE: Romania, okay, that's cool.  I mean I'm sure everyone asks, but I didn't know what to guess.  I was going to guess--I don't know.  I think I would have gotten it wrong.  How long have you been over here?  
1:12 1:14 FEMALE:  Three years. 
1:14 1:18 MALE:  Oh, okay.  So you settled--do you like it, or do you want to go there?  
1:18 1:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  You should keep saying more about American politics.  
1:24 1:26 MALE:  Oh, anyone knows.  What do you want to know?  
1:28 1:29 FEMALE:  Will they kick us out [unintelligible]?  
1:30 1:33 MALE:  Oh, you mean, I don't know.  
1:33 1:38 FEMALE:  What are you going to vote--either Bush, or republican, or--
1:39 1:54 MALE:  Well, the U.S. Senate just voted just yesterday about whether or not to do a guest worker program, and it failed.  So, that's not good.  Guest workers are from Mexico mostly, but it gives a sentiment of, you know, what immigration policy is like.  
1:54 1:55 FEMALE:  So, it's not good?  
1:56 1:57 MALE: I don't think so, no.  
1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:59 2:02 MALE:  But I think it's a lot better to be from Romania than a lot of places.  
2:05 2:15 FEMALE: Is it like if the republicans are coming does that make it
any better than if the democrats are coming?  Or it doesn't matter, or you
are going to [unintelligible]?  
2:15 2:22 MALE:  They have to have 60 votes to do anything in the Senate, and so probably--I don't know.  It might not make a difference.  It's hard to know. 
2:23 2:27 FEMALE:  Which side of the political spectrum are you?  
2:27 2:29 MALE:  I'm a democrat or a liberal as you say.  
2:30 2:31 FEMALE:  I [unintelligible].  
2:32 2:35 MALE:  Yeah, do you follow politics in Romania a lot, or... 
2:35 2:36 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
2:37 2:38 MALE:  Is your family still there?  
2:38 2:39 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:40 2:42 MALE:  You guys won the gold in gymnastics, didn't you?  
2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:44 2:46 MALE:  Everyone talks about that?  
2:47 2:50 FEMALE: Sometimes, not [unintelligible].  
2:51 2:51 MALE:  That was a big deal.  
2:53 2:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean for us [unintelligible].  
2:58 3:00 MALE:  I don't [unintelligible] either.  I just--
3:02 3:03 FEMALE: [interposing]  But you like to do--
3:03 3:12 MALE:  I like jogging.  I like hiking.  I like going to sporting events.  I like playing sports although you--
3:13 3:16 FEMALE:  Going to [unintelligible].  
3:17 3:18 MALE:  Where?  What area?  
3:19 3:24 FEMALE:  So, I don't know.  I am through the [unintelligible].  
3:25 3:27 MALE: Like get you into Soho, or...
3:28 3:33 FEMALE:  Soho, yeah, or wherever.  I don't know--wherever my roommates want to go, or wherever we--
3:35 3:46 MALE:  [interposing]  I like the city.  It was a very weak [crosstalk]  Take care.
