0:09 0:10 FEMALE:  A small town in eastern Kentucky. 
0:11 0:11 MALE:  Where, which one?

0:29 0:31 MALE:  Wow [laughter] it was down through like the Hazzard area and such.  
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah I'm a little north of that.  
0:34 0:35 MALE:  Okay. 
0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  Where in Virginia are you from? 
0:37 0:37 MALE:  Uh, up north by D.C.  
0:38 0:40 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:41 0:41 MALE:  Okay, so [laughter] I'm making gestures like I'm looking on a map.  
0:42 0:44 FEMALE:  Okay. 
           [horn]
0:45 0:46 ANNOUNCER:  Okay, we're starting your first date now.  
0:47 0:49 MALE:  Okay, so um, what's your major? 
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  Um, linguistics. 
0:51 0:52 MALE:  Linguistics? 
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm a second year grad student. 
0:53 0:54 MALE:  Okay.  
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  What about you?  
0:56 0:57 MALE:  Um, I am an engineer. 
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:58 0:58 MALE:  I'm an electrical engineer, and I'm a first year grad, grad student.  
1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:01 1:02 MALE:  So, I uh, actually took a linguistics class as an undergrad.  
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  Really?  What class was that? 
1:05 1:09 MALE:  It was, it was like, it was a writing seminar and it was called Understanding Utterances.  
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:12 1:23 MALE:  Which I think what a linguist is all about right?  And so we learned about how, you know, the, the use of a word defines -- makes it's meaning and stuff like that.  And uh, I always found it kind of fascinating, but never really got, you know--
1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:24 1:28 MALE:  --it's kind of like the intro sort of learning how to write type of thing.  [unintelligible] and everything. 
1:29 1:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  A lot of people think linguistics is interesting if you talk to them about it, because everybody uses language and like kind of has experience with it in their own life, and so there's a lot of people, but they take an internal linguistics class or something like that and think oh that's really cool.  Or you know, bring it up to people, like everybody wants to talk about what, what their dialect is, you know, and like everybody thinks that's sort of interesting.  
1:52 1:53 MALE:  So what attracted you to linguistics?  
1:54 2:09 FEMALE:  I don't know, I always like language, um, and I always like science, and so it like, um, it seemed like the natural combination of, of that and I just took the intro class and just like the first day, was oh this is it, I found it, I found it.   It was really fun. 
2:10 2:11 MALE:  That's really cool, most people don't run into that.  
2:11 2:16 FEMALE:  I know, I felt really lucky to find that.  What made you want to do electrical engineering?  
2:17 2:25 MALE:  Um, [laughter] well I was always uh, you know, in high school and stuff I was really good in math and science classes and everything so it just seemed like a logical step to go into engineering. 
2:26 2:26 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:27 2:32 MALE:  And then I spat it around, and played with different [unintelligible] of engineering and finally decided electrical because it was the uh, most challenging.  
2:33 2:33 FEMALE:  Okay. 
2:33 2:33 MALE:  So.  
2:34 2:36 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:37 2:38 MALE:  I wonder what that says about me in 30 seconds.  [laughter] 
2:39 2:39 FEMALE:  [laughter] All right. 
2:40 2:40 MALE:  I found that hardest thing I could do and tried it.  
2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:42 2:42 MALE:  So--
2:43 2:54 FEMALE:  Well I understand that, kind of because like, you know, like in my own way, like in language and stuff, like I want to learn a new language that has the certain feature that I haven't dealt with before, like tone or something, you know, like oh I want to challenge myself--
2:55 2:55 MALE:  [laughter]
2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  --and pick something, you know, on the next level.  
2:57 2:58 MALE:  Right. Or quick or something like that.  
2:59 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, like why not, just to say I can, you know, I, I jumped that hurdle, kind of fun.  I, I understand that.  
3:04 3:05 MALE:  So do you speak a bunch of languages? 
3:06 3:09 FEMALE:  Well that's not really what they want us to do, because it takes away from our time on studying the actual like linguistics. 
3:10 3:11 MALE:  Sure. 
3:11 3:14 FEMALE:  But actually I, that's what I'd like to do.  That's what I would like, like I studied French all through school--
3:15 3:15 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:16 3:22 FEMALE:  --and then likely lately I've been doing Japanese which is what I'm really interested in right now.  And I do a little Spanish on the side, but I'd like to start Mandarin. 
3:23 3:24 MALE:  Now, now Mandarin, yeah.  
3:25 3:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's what I'd like to do. 
3:26 3:26 MALE:  So Japanese isn't a tonal language right? 
3:27 3:28 FEMALE:  It's not, yeah. 
3:29 3:29 MALE:  But Mandarin definitely is? 
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
3:31 3:35 MALE:  Yeah.  I've always, I've always been kind of intimidated by the Asian languages.  [laughter] 
3:36 3:43 FEMALE:  The initial hurdle with Japanese was really like high, I felt like it was really challenging, but I went on a teaching program over there to go teach English--
3:44 3:44 MALE:  Ah, okay. 
3:45 3:49 FEMALE:  --and so I was just kind of thrown in.  And I was like, what the hell, I'll just learn a new language. 
3:50 3:50 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
3:51 3:51 FEMALE:  Give it a shot, you know.  And so I didn't really know anything about it, and got over there and ended up really liking it.  But the initial hurdle of learning a bunch of sounds that don't mean, that don't have anything to attach to in, in you head--
4:04 4:04 MALE:  Right.   
4:05 4:17 FEMALE:  --like people's names and stuff like where is it.  It's just completely just random, arbitrary group of syllables you know.  But then once you get it a little bit figured out and you can start putting things together, then it, the ball gets kind of rolling and then--
4:18 4:18 MALE:  Right. 
4:18 4:24 FEMALE:  --starts being really more and fun and easy.  But, but I like the initial period too, though.  I mean you're trying to figure everything out. 
4:25 4:25 MALE:  Where you're staggering around.
4:25 4:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
4:26 4:26 MALE: Fumbling around in the dark. 
4:26 4:32 FEMALE:  And every day you're learning something really gratifying like how to say, like what your birthday is, or how to ask like--
           [horn]
4:33 4:34 FEMALE:  --you know, where the bathroom is.  [laughter]
4:35 4:35 MALE:  Yeah.  Well it was nice meeting you.  
4:35 4:36 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you.    
4:37 4:38 MALE:  Oh, you move first.  That's right.  
4:39 4:39 FEMALE:  Okay. 
4:39 4:39 MALE: Move first then fill out. 
4:40 4:40 FEMALE:  Yes, okay.
