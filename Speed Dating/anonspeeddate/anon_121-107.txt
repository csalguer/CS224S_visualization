1:23 1:24 MALE: That might be it.  Yeah, yeah.

1:18 1:18 FEMALE: Okay.

1:25 1:26 MALE: That probably be one place.

1:37 1:41 FEMALE: We're having um, drinks next Wednesday at the Nuthouse so you'll have to come.  We'll send an email out.

1:48 1:49 MALE: I love the Nuthouse.

1:42 1:46 FEMALE: Mm hmm.  Because we want everyone to play pool, and darts, and foosball. 

1:53 1:54 MALE: That's good.  That's perfect.

1:48 1:54 FEMALE: Excellent, so yeah I told-I sent them an email that said we've got to get everybody out.  Because the spring is like already halfway--

2:01 2:11 MALE: I know I'm-I like, I like a party every quarter for all the LSTD and LDP people and this thing it just hasn't happened yet.  And everyone is like where is the party? [laughter] 

1:59 1:59 FEMALE: Uh huh.

2:12 2:14 MALE: [unintelligible] I'll do it, I'll do it.

2:05 2:08 FEMALE: [laughter] It's stressful.

2:16 2:20 MALE: For me, [unintelligible] in the sense that [unintelligible] defended my proposal, the dissertation proposal, but already--

2:13 2:13 FEMALE: How'd it go?

2:21 2:21 MALE: It went pretty well.

2:15 2:15 FEMALE: Congratulations.

2:21 2:26 MALE: So I'm already in the field collecting data.  So it's like really hectic, you know?

2:19 2:22 FEMALE: Bravo.  Excellent, excellent.  Was that really stressful?

2:30 2:31 MALE: That was really stressful.

2:24 2:24 FEMALE: I bet.

2:32 2:35 MALE: Four people on the committee.  There's that and a lot of things.

2:28 2:34 FEMALE: But don't they give you enough feedback leading up to it that you sort of know going into it whether it's going to go or not?  Or do you really not know?

2:42 2:43 MALE: No, no, you know. 
 
2:35 2:37 FEMALE: Do they say no?  Do they turn people down?

2:44 2:50 MALE: You know what the outcome would be but it depends a lot on your advisors, how hard they make you work for that.

2:45 2:45 FEMALE: Interesting.

2:53 3:04 MALE: And it's really interesting because my proposal is very different than the way I do my studies so I'm doing like an ethnography.  So everything that's in the proposal is already kind of out of it because--

2:57 2:59 FEMALE: Uh huh.  Trouble.

3:06 3:10 MALE: I don't know if that's trouble but it's like, let's see what happens.  It's not that big a deal.

3:02 3:06 FEMALE: Sure.  And they were all right with it?  Everybody was all right with it?

3:13 3:13 MALE: Yeah.

3:07 3:07 FEMALE: Good.

3:14 3:18 MALE: One of them forgot when it was and thought it was the day before than it was.

3:12 3:15 FEMALE: Not surprising.  What are you going to do?

3:22 3:24 MALE: Yeah.  So I was like whatever, yeah.

3:16 3:21 FEMALE: That's great.  So then now--so that--how many more years--how many years do you think it will take you to finish?

3:28 3:30 MALE: Another year.  I'm trying to do it in four.

3:23 3:24 FEMALE: Good for you.

3:31 3:37 MALE: Let's see.  My committee--my committee doesn't think it's going to happen in four but I'm trying to do it in four.

3:30 3:31 FEMALE: I feel like yes it would.  [laughter] 

3:38 3:39 MALE: Yeah, they're like, we don't think so.

3:33 3:35 FEMALE: That's fast.  But maybe--

3:40 3:45 MALE: Yeah, that's even with a masters.  So I transferred all my courses like--

3:38 3:39 FEMALE: Did you get a masters here?

3:46 3:47 MALE: No.  In Georgia Tech.

3:41 3:44 FEMALE: At Georgia Tech.  In something similar or--?

3:49 3:51 FEMALE: Awesome. Awesome.  And how are the--

4:01 4:02 MALE: [unintelligible] 

3:57 4:09 FEMALE: Just great.  It sprays a lot.  It sprays a lot of stuff.  [laughter]  So we'll get an email out to everybody about next Wednesday.  You should come have a drink.  [laughter] 

4:16 4:16 MALE: Sure.
