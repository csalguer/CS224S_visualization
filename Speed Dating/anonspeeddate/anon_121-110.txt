0:58 0:58 FEMALE: Great.

3:22 3:23 MALE: So we'll see.  I don't know.

1:01 1:05 FEMALE: Good for you.  You're not going to McKinsey like everybody else?

3:25 3:34 MALE: No, I worked at McKinsey this past summer.  But like you know, my roommate is actually a dual degree education and MBA.

1:33 1:36 FEMALE: nameX and I know.  Uh huh, and nameX [phonetic] I know that whole crew.

3:56 3:58 MALE: Oh I know [unintelligible] 

1:39 1:40 FEMALE: Yeah, a bunch of them.

4:00 4:04 MALE: You know, like nameX [phonetic] and a bunch of them.  I know them all.

1:41 1:44 FEMALE: Uh huh, uh huh, all those guys.

4:05 4:05 MALE: Good guys.

1:46 2:02 FEMALE: They are good guys.  It's fun for us because I'm in a masters program at the ed school but it's the one that's the most overlapped with the GSB so I've taken a couple classes over there so it's kind of nice to get to know them and expose us to a whole different--the MO is really different over at the GSB.

4:22 4:25 MALE: So you're like are you more on the leadership side or--

2:05 2:09 FEMALE: Mm hmm.  The policy and organization programs, so we're doing it.

4:30 4:32 MALE: I'm taking a class from-I don't know if you know Deb Myerson, Deborah Myerson.

2:12 2:14 FEMALE: Are you taking the organizing for diversity class?

4:35 4:37 MALE: Yeah, we call it leadership in diverse organizations but--

2:18 2:23 FEMALE: I'm taking the ed school one.  She's teaching one in the GSB and one at the ed school so I'm in the one here.

4:43 4:45 MALE: You're in that class--that class Monday right?

2:23 2:24 FEMALE: Uh huh, uh huh.

4:45 4:46 MALE: Yeah.  I'm in GSB.

2:26 2:26 FEMALE: Oh really?

4:46 4:47 MALE: She talks about your class.

2:27 2:31 FEMALE: Oh really?  She tells us about your class so--  [laughter] Mm hmm.

4:49 4:54 MALE: Oh is that right?  Is that right?  MBA kids are like oh you've got to get it right.  [laughter] 

2:35 2:38 FEMALE: Mm hmm, I know, and we're all like let's share and everyone's--

4:59 4:59 MALE: Yeah.

2:39 2:54 FEMALE: Be nice to each other and talk about our feelings, and she's like you guys--  Well it was interesting because she's showed us the aggregated scores from your tests and it was interesting to see how different they were from those on line association tests that we had to do.

5:15 5:19 MALE: So what do you associate for [unintelligible] but what's your, you know, preference?

2:59 3:00 FEMALE: For which one?

5:20 5:20 MALE: Korea.

3:00 3:03 FEMALE: We didn't do that one.  She gave us different ones to do.

5:24 5:25 MALE: So what did you do, like--?

3:05 3:07 FEMALE: We did um, we did gender and science.

5:28 5:28 MALE: Oh yeah.

3:08 3:42 FEMALE: And yeah, we did that one.  And I had--it's like a slight association of male with science, which made me kind of mad but I guess sort of how the world pushes that whole thing.  Um, we did the Asian, we did the black / white one, and we did--she's going to be mad but I can't even remember.  I did a number of other ones on my own afterwards so I can't remember which one we did for the class.  I thought they were kind of interesting.  It was like pretty mindless to do it and kind of interesting to see what came up.

6:02 6:09 MALE: Yeah I mean, yeah I was thinking about it but like nothing, for me at least nothing came.  Like most [unintelligible].  I'll tell you why.

3:50 3:50 FEMALE: Why?

6:10 6:29 MALE: Because I got the association, I mean I got--it came out that like the only thing where it was at least until this period that like for black and white people [horn] like I associate female with Korea.

4:10 4:13 FEMALE: You did?  Were you the only person in that room who did that?

6:33 6:36 MALE: There were like two males.  Two makes did that.

4:16 4:21 FEMALE: Thank you so much.  Nobody else.  I can't believe it.

6:43 6:45 MALE: [laughter] 

4:24 4:28 FEMALE: That's really reassuring actually, that [laughter]
