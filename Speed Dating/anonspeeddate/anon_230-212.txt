0:01 0:08 FEMALE: Finally someone's name whom I can confidently write.  [unintelligible].  [horn]  Tell me how is it, how's it going for you?

0:04 0:06 MALE: Um terrific in getting better.  It's my--

0:10 0:11 FEMALE: [laughter].

0:06 0:09 MALE: --my first experience with this stuff, so I--

0:13 0:14 FEMALE: The first time.

0:10 0:11 MALE: Yeah.  

0:15 0:18 FEMALE: First guy I talked to, just [unintelligible] all the same after a while, you're, like, saying the same things over and over again.

0:14 0:16 MALE: Yeah.  I try to vary the routine and stuff, but uh--

0:19 0:25 FEMALE: Well if you like any of the girls here, I know most of them, so, you know, I could hook you up.

0:21 0:22 MALE: I'll keep, keep that in mind.

0:26 0:33 FEMALE: Two of my, yeah, two of my roommates are here, and then there's, their friends.  They're all coming over to our house later.  We're going to have, like, a debrief.  Debrief party.

0:30 0:36 MALE: That's the way actually I ran into, I think your one roommate, she's like female230's such a great cook and everything, it's like--

0:40 0:48 FEMALE: [laughter] That's what she said--people say, but, you know, all they--all, all they are saying it is just 'cause, you know, they're wanting to be polite.  You know how when people invite you to your house.

0:43 0:45 MALE: Right.  Yeah.  

0:49 0:51  FEMALE: They'll feel bad if you say--you know, if they don't find [unintelligible].

0:48 0:51 MALE: [unintelligible] I'm actually in a French cooking class this quarter.

0:55 0:59 FEMALE: I know, I heard.  That's uh, nameX in there too, right?

0:56 0:57 MALE: Yeah.  I think so, yeah.

1:01 1:02 FEMALE: And uh, this Hong Kong girl.

0:58 0:59 MALE: Yeah.  nameX. 

1:02 1:03 FEMALE: nameX, yeah.

0:59 1:00 MALE: Yeah.  

1:03 1:07 FEMALE: There we are.  Oh what are you guys learning?  I almost took that class, by the way.  I almost did.

1:03 1:04 MALE: It, it was really useful.

1:08 1:10 FEMALE: But then I heard it was French pastry, and so I'm like--

1:06 1:07 MALE: Yeah.  

1:10 1:11 FEMALE: Uh.

1:07 1:10 MALE: Your skills are probably much more elevated than us anyway, but--

1:13 1:14 FEMALE: What are they, what are they doing?

1:11 1:21 MALE: Um well every other Thursday we do a different cooking thing, so we did like [unintelligible], we've done truffles, so we did quiche, and this, this Thursday is 'eclairs.  We have a bread unit, and--

1:25 1:30 FEMALE: See, is it pastry, and so--I didn't realize that that could be both savory pastry and sweet pastry.

1:26 1:27 MALE: Yeah.  

1:31 1:32 FEMALE: When I think of pastry I think sweet.

1:28 1:29 MALE: Yeah.  I know--

1:33 1:35 FEMALE: And I'm not really interested in making desserts.

1:31 1:32 MALE: Yeah.  

1:35 1:36 FEMALE: So I was like, whatever.

1:32 1:38 MALE: I didn't really think we'd be doing quiche, but you know, there we are making the batter and pouring all the eggs in.

1:41 1:42 FEMALE: Oh really, really.  Is it easy?

1:38 1:41 MALE: It's, yeah.  A lot, a lot of the stuff's pretty easier than I thought.

1:43 1:46 FEMALE: Do you have, like, recipe cards and stuff?

1:42 1:46 MALE: Yeah.  We have a recipe, and then, you know, we divide up, like, some people measure the ingredients, and some people stir, and--

1:50 1:54 FEMALE: Oh but that's no good though.  You need to have the whole experience.  

1:50 1:51 MALE: I know, but there's like--

1:55 1:56 FEMALE: How can you just do part of the meal?  That sucks.

1:53 1:57 MALE: I guess it's the price you have to pay for having 20 people in the class or something.

2:01 2:02 FEMALE: Oh it's 20 people in the class?

1:58 1:59 MALE: Yeah.  

2:03 2:04 FEMALE: Oh.

1:59 2:04 MALE: It's kind of crazy, and we're all in, like, the kitchen, but it's cool.  I have my little experience, you know, I can--

2:08 2:09 FEMALE: Do you cook usually?

2:05 2:08 MALE: Yeah.  Well I cook all my meals.  I am, I'm doing much better now.

2:12 2:13 FEMALE: I'm going to marry you.

2:09 2:13 MALE: Well, I have my George Foreman grill, and you'd be surprised what you can whip up.

2:16 2:19 FEMALE: Dude, I love that thing.  Uh my roommate bought one.

2:15 2:16 MALE: Yeah.  

2:20 2:21 FEMALE: Uh it's very good.  They make great quesadillas is what I say.

2:17 2:19 MALE: Oh I've never made one with that, but yeah.

2:23 2:30 FEMALE: It's great.  Just buy the tortilla, like, the soft taco shape, then make something simple with, like, cheese and stuff to put in it.

2:25 2:26 MALE: Right.  

2:30 2:32 FEMALE: And a nice grilled texture comes out.

2:28 2:34 MALE: Yeah.  I did my sandwiches like that, but I think the worst thing I did with the George Foreman grill was, like, bacon wrapped scallops, and--

2:38 2:42 FEMALE: Bacon wraps?  Oh, so they burned the bacon onto [unintelligible].

2:38 2:42 MALE: Yeah.  The bacon burned onto the thing and I was like, that's too messy.

2:46 2:47 FEMALE: Aw, you should've tried the oven for that.

2:43 2:44 MALE: Yeah.  

2:47 2:48 FEMALE: We should cook something together.

2:44 2:45 MALE: Exactly.

2:49 2:51 FEMALE: You know, we should have a big MS and E party, you and me.

2:47 2:48 MALE: Right.  Right.  

2:52 2:53 FEMALE: That would be like the [unintelligible] female230 sponsored party.

2:49 2:51 MALE: Yeah.  We could impress all our friends and stuff.

2:54 2:55 FEMALE: But I love cooking.

2:51 2:56 MALE: We're running out of time though, you know, there's only six weeks left and we'll move on.

2:57 3:00 FEMALE: I know.  No kidding.  What are you doing, by the way, after this?

2:57 3:02 MALE: I'm not sure.  Well, like, I, I just got exempted from the CS requirement today, so I don't have to do anything this fall.

3:06 3:07 FEMALE: That's awesome.

3:03 3:05 MALE: I'm, you know, applying to different jobs.  I just had one today, and--

3:09 3:11 FEMALE: You mean they, they kept you hanging for so long?

3:08 3:27 MALE: Yeah.  It kind of made me mad.  I sent in the petition early on, and, like I guess the professor just didn't respond for, like, weeks and weeks, and weeks.  And so I was just in today for, like, the sixth time.  It's like, you know, it'd be nice to know one way or the other.  I'm, like, interviewing with these people, and I'm, like, saying well, you know, I might work in the fall, but I might not.  

3:32 3:34 FEMALE: Yeah.  It sounds--it reflects badly, but it's not your fault, you know?

3:30 3:31 MALE: Yeah.  Right.  

3:35 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:32 3:35 MALE: So it's nice, you know.  I don't really have to program now, I'm happy about that.

3:40 3:42 FEMALE: So what are you hoping?  Pixar?  Pixar [laughter].

3:38 3:44 MALE: Yeah.  I did the Disney one, so I'm hoping for that.  I guess I don't have the programming skills for Pixar, but um, or either that or, like some consultancy.

3:48 3:51 FEMALE: Does everybody have to be a creative designer to work at Pixar though?

3:48 3:49 MALE: At least what they're advertising for.

3:53 3:54 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:50 3:54 MALE: So I mean you would think that there have to be people that, like, hire the people or manage--

3:57 3:58 FEMALE: Or marketing for that matter.

3:54 3:56 MALE: Yeah.  Exactly.  Marketing and stuff, but--

4:00 4:01 FEMALE: Or strategists.

3:57 3:58 MALE: Yes.

4:02 4:03 FEMALE: Remember strategy?  Oh yeah.

3:59 4:02 MALE: Right.  So you're heading back to, to Singapore next year then?

4:06 4:09 FEMALE: I, in fact [horn] I probably leave the day after commencement.

4:05 4:06 MALE: Oh wow.

4:10 4:17 FEMALE: I have to start work pretty soon.  Yeah.  So we need to get this, like, MS and E, maybe it can be an MS and E party, like, you know, we'll invite the people that we know.  I don't know everybody in MS and E, so.

4:13 4:14 MALE: Right.  Right.  Sounds good.

4:18 4:19 FEMALE: Have fun.  Rock on.

4:15 4:16 MALE: Take care.

4:20 4:21 FEMALE: Continue to rock on.  Hi, how are you.
