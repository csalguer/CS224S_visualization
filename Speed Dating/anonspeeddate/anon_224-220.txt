0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  [laughter] So bad. [laughter] 
0:05 0:08 MALE:  That's pretty fast.  [laughter] 
0:09 0:13 FEMALE:  Um, okay.  Sorry.  
0:14 0:14 MALE:  It's okay. 
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:15 0:15 MALE:  How's it going? 
0:16 0:18 FEMALE:  Good.  These are going way faster then I really thought they would.  
0:19 0:19 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  Even the evaluation process is. 
0:22 0:22 MALE:  Well at least you don't have, you know-- 
0:23 0:26 FEMALE:  Well now, you've already met so, we had our, you know--
0:27 0:27 MALE:  -- there's no awkward silence.  
0:27 0:27 FEMALE:  --rendezvous over there.  [laughter] 
0:28 0:28 MALE:  That's right, you're a business student.  
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  I am, you're an engineering student?  
0:31 0:31 MALE:  Yes that's right.  
0:32 0:34 FEMALE:  [laughter] Like everyone else that's been through so far.  
0:35 0:35 MALE:  Oh yeah?  Oh really? 
0:36 0:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, every single person, engineering.  [laughter] 
0:39 0:39 MALE:  Oh really?  
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Yes.  
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Because they sent this E-mail that said oh we really need engineering students. 
0:42 0:47 FEMALE:  But I think maybe it's just that there's like electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, maybe that's how the diversity [laughter].
0:48 0:50 MALE:  I think, I'm an electrical engineer, are they all electrical engineers?  
0:51 0:51 FEMALE: Most of them have been electrical engineering.  
0:52 0:52 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:53 0:53 FEMALE:  But oh well. 
0:53 0:53 MALE:  Oh, oh well.  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:55 0:58 MALE:  So, so how long are you, so how far along are you in the business school?  Oh you're MBA, so--
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  Uh, first year.  Yeah, business school. 
1:01 1:01 MALE:  --you're almost, you're almost done. 
1:02 1:02 FEMALE: First year, halfway.
1:03 1:03 MALE:  Okay, cool. 
1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  It's very sad, it goes by really fast.  
1:05 1:05 MALE: Mm-hmm.  
1:06 1:11 FEMALE:  Although, I don't know, its, its, its scary not making money for so long, [laughter] but it's fine.  
1:12 1:12 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  It'll all work out. 
1:13 1:13 MALE:  You must have worked before you--
1:14 1:17 FEMALE:  I did.  I did, the only thing is I'm totally transitioning careers--
1:18 1:18 MALE:  Uh huh. 
1:18 1:22 FEMALE:  --so, in the career I'm transitioning into, it's like, I want to go into entertainment. 
1:23 1:23 MALE:  Okay.  
1:24 1:33 FEMALE:  So, the business side, so it's one of those where they don't really value MBA's quite as much, so you have to take kind of a salary hit because I was in finance before.  
1:34 1:34 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  I worked in private equity. 
1:35 1:35 MALE:  Wow. 
1:36 1:40 FEMALE:  Um, and, but that's what you do.  You make sacrifices for what you're passionate about, right?  
1:41 1:43 MALE:  Yeah.  I'm sure MBA's get paid a lot no matter what, right?  
1:44 1:48 FEMALE:  [laughter] I know, it's kind of hard to complain.  So how many years are you into your program? 
1:49 1:49 MALE:  Uh, I'm in my sixth year. 
1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  Wow, so you're almost done? 
1:51 1:56 MALE:  Yeah.  That's what everyone said, you're almost done.  Um, yeah, I think I'll be done in December or um, in the winter. 
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  Are you excited?  Do you know what you're going to do? 
1:59 2:33 MALE:  Uh, yeah, I'm pretty excited, but I'm not, I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do.  I mean, I have a plan of, yeah, I think I want to try to find an interesting post-doc, or uh, or if there's, if there's a good opportunity for like a small company or something, then I'll go for that.  But I think that's, that's, that's kind of what I ultimately want to do, is something sort of researchy and um, and kind of on the science end of things.  So, I, I guess a lot of engineers try to think this way, they don't want to work for a big company, and be just another guy, so that's the one thing that's definitely true.  Yeah.  
2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  You could become an entrepreneur.  [laughter] 
2:36 2:40 MALE:  That would be, that would be great, I mean I know a lot of people who do that and, yeah, that's definitely--
2:41 2:45 FEMALE:  Do they let the engineering students take any business school classes or? 
2:46 2:49 MALE:  You guys are pretty arrogant in the business school, right?  [laughter] They won't let us, no they don't--
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:51 2:54 MALE:  [laughter] --it's pretty hard, it's pretty hard to take class over there, it's like no we don't want you.  
2:55 2:55 FEMALE:  Oh really? 
2:55 2:56 MALE:  I guess so.  I haven't--
2:57 3:03 FEMALE:  Well they let us take undergrad classes, I don't know if they do, let us take anything in the PhD program, probably not, but--
3:04 3:04 MALE:  Oh really? 
3:04 3:06 FEMALE:  I mean I don't know if we'd be qualified for it.  [laughter] 
3:07 3:07 MALE:  Probably not, yeah. 
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  We'd feel like, woo.  
3:08 3:10 MALE:  Well if you were an electrical engineering student, like as an undergrad or something. Then you could, yeah. 
3:11 3:15 FEMALE:  Right, no, that, that would make sense.  I know that there is um, classes that are over in the engineering school that are like on public speaking--
3:16 3:16 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:16 3:17 FEMALE:  But I think that's undergrad. 
3:18 3:18 MALE:  Okay. 
3:19 3:21 FEMALE:  Because those are really popular with um, business school students.  
3:22 3:25 MALE:  But there's a lot of uh, I guess, I mean like E-challenge, do you know about E-challenge?  
3:26 3:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:27 3:28 MALE:  So that's, I know people who are uh, have done that. 
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Oh so um, the PhD students get involved with that as well? 
3:31 3:35 MALE:  I think, yeah, actually, actually a guy in group was a world wide winner in-- 
3:36 3:36 FEMALE:  Really? 
3:36 3:36 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
3:37 3:38 FEMALE:  That's exciting. 
3:38 3:39 MALE:  It was like him and like five MS&E students.   So yeah, pretty cool. 
3:40 3:42 FEMALE:  Wow, so there weren't any business school students in that at all? 
3:43 3:45 MALE:  Just, just I guess MS&E sort of, businessy guys.  I know--
3:46 3:47 FEMALE:  You don't need the business people.  [laughter] 
3:48 3:58 MALE:  No, you definitely, no you definitely do because  to put together a good business plan, we just,  when you have to, you know, make your financial plan, you just don't know, like how to make it, what's, what's important. 
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
           [horn]
4:01 4:01 FEMALE:  Wow. 
4:02 4:02 MALE:  Wow, that was fast. 
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  That was really fast.  [laughter] 
4:04 4:04 MALE:  Well it was awesome to meet you. 
4:05 4:08 FEMALE:  It was nice to meet you too.
