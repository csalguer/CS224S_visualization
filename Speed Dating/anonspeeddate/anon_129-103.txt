0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  I think I'm getting behind.  
0:03 0:03 MALE:  I know.
0:04 0:08 FEMALE:  Throw it in that one.  I'm going to get in trouble.  How are you doing?  
0:08 0:09 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:09 0:11 FEMALE:  Me too.  So, yesterday I--
0:12 0:13 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, so what happened to you?
0:14 0:33 FEMALE:  I was picking up Maria because she was coming over to our house, and [unintelligible] and commented sort of--I speak zero Spanish.  And of course both of my roommates are both like totally fluent so they're always like just chatting away with her.  And I'm the one who is like going to get her, and so I'm like this is going to be great.  So, I go--the deal was that I was going to pick her up at 12:30 unless I heard from her that she needed longer.  
0:33 0:33 MALE:  She didn't call.  
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  She didn't call so I went over at 12:30.  It was 1:00, whatever.
0:36 0:36 MALE:  Oh, man.  
0:37 1:10 FEMALE:  She totally speaks English by the way.  I had plenty to say.  I mean it's not a long way from your house to my house, and she was talking the whole time, the whole time--love her.  She was telling me all about the house that she goes to on Mondays, non [unintelligible] guys.  She cleans their house every Monday.  It takes her eight hours, and one of them gave her $200 [unintelligible], and she was like it was very nice of him.  She's like so now when I have extra time I do his laundry.  [laughter]  So, [crosstalk].

1:17 1:17 MALE:  I know.
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  Me too.  So, what are you doing?  
1:19 1:22 MALE:  Technically, I'm [unintelligible].
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  What do you mean?
1:25 1:26 MALE:  I know.  I might be [unintelligible].  
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  That's okay.  I've done that before.  
1:29 1:31 MALE:  [unintelligible]
1:32 1:38 FEMALE:  Okay, and what is it supposed to be?  You're right.  Oh, you're right.  You were there last summer, Atlanta.  
1:40 1:44 MALE:  Atlanta, yeah, which I'm--I wouldn't mind Atlanta, but it's [unintelligible].  
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  I had an astrologer tell me once that Atlanta was a bad place for me.  
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Really?  
1:48 2:01 FEMALE: So, I'm going to Mexico next week, and I'm flying through Atlanta.  And I'm [unintelligible] a bad place for me.  I just know [unintelligible].  She's like, you're kidding me, right?  I'm like I'm just telling you this information so that if something happens to me next week you know.  
2:01 2:03 MALE:  You could go back to that astrologer.  
2:03 2:10 FEMALE:  I know, seriously, I'm like I can't believe it.  But, of course, they tell you something bad, and it--you know, I'll be scared to death in Atlanta.  
2:10 2:10 MALE: [unintelligible].  
2:11 2:12 FEMALE: Now you want to say yours?
2:14 2:15 MALE:  I don't know how, or why, or what--
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  Are you looking at other stuff?  
2:18 2:19 MALE: [unintelligible] 
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, cool.  
2:20 2:24 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] not for Home Depot.  
2:24 2:26 MALE:  Not for Home Depot but for Atlanta [unintelligible].
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Okay.  Yeah.  
2:27 2:29 MALE:  There could be others.  You know what you're looking for?  
2:29 2:33 FEMALE:  I'm starting to.  I have two interviews tomorrow so that's a good thing.  
2:33 2:33 MALE:  That's good.  
2:34 2:40 FEMALE:  Yeah, phone.  No, actually I'm almost 100% looking at non-profits.  
2:40 2:40 MALE:  Really?  
2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:41 2:41 MALE:  That's awesome.  
2:42 3:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, they're all doing urban school reform sort of lightly going outside, which was really nice but different for the level.  Some are much more school-based.  Some are more district.  Some are personnel.  So, several different teachers [unintelligible], but all doing reform stuff from outside of [unintelligible], which is one of my--I do not want a paycheck from the government.  [laughter]  I do not want a--no, you know.  That was sort of one of the first things that I figured out was what I didn't want.  
3:13 3:13 MALE:  Well, that's a good thing to know.  
3:14 3:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, it is.  
3:14 3:20 MALE:  Are you getting [unintelligible] though if you get another job like there's a million education-based non-profit [unintelligible].  
3:21 3:21 FEMALE:  There is?  
3:22 3:23 MALE:  A million of them, a million of them.  
3:23 3:40 FEMALE:  Can I tell you how annoying it is that people--thank god for the [unintelligible] degree people because they are the people who have a message.  Like every--every person at Stanford who isn't useful in a networking sense has been [unintelligible].  
3:40 3:40 MALE:  Really?  
3:41 3:45 FEMALE:  So, the [unintelligible] people have been [unintelligible] are useless in that department. It's so frustrating.  
3:45 3:46 MALE:  That's too bad.  
3:46 3:48 FEMALE:  But thank god for the [unintelligible].  
3:49 3:49 MALE:  Yeah.

3:55 4:03 FEMALE:  Those and Kelly Reed, the three of them, they're such a wealth of information, and they're just so willing to share it.  And they just put you in touch with people, and, you know--
4:04 4:06 MALE:  [interposing]  You should have to get like [unintelligible].  
4:06 4:12 FEMALE:  Well, great [unintelligible].  It's been great.  It's been great.
