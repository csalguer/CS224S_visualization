0:04 0:04 MALE: Boy, that's way too fast.
0:03 0:04 FEMALE: Yeah, just a second.  [laughter]
0:06 0:06 MALE: Yeah, sure, no problem.
0:05 0:15 FEMALE: Oh.  [pause]
0:09 0:10 MALE: It's over for me.  
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  [pause]  Alright.  female332.
0:19 0:20 MALE: I'm nameX.  Nice to meet you.
0:18 0:18 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:21 0:24 MALE: So um, what are you up to?  Tell me something interesting.  I mean--
0:22 0:23 FEMALE: Something interesting.
0:25 0:26 MALE: Different from all the other guys--
0:25 0:28 FEMALE: Um.  Let's see.  [pause]
0:34 0:36 MALE: Are you a Berkeley grad?  Are you not?
0:34 0:36 FEMALE: Berkeley?  No.  Are you?
0:39 0:41 MALE: No.  Uh, are you local?
0:40 0:41 FEMALE: No, I'm from Oregon.
0:43 0:46 MALE: Oregon, okay.  Awesome.  Uh, I'm from Rhode Island, myself.
0:43 0:48 FEMALE: Okay, so I'm going to try this question on you, because I didn't come up with something interesting.  
0:49 0:49 MALE: Okay, okay.
0:48 0:51 FEMALE: Tell me something you learned, new, recently.
0:53 1:01 MALE: Learned new recently.  Um, It's difficult to maintain a degree of novelty once [unintelligible] stranger who are-- 
0:59 1:01 FEMALE: You know, I just learned that as well.  [laughter]
1:03 1:17 MALE: That's interesting, yeah.  [laughter]  Uh, but uh, let's see, what else did I learn that's not true?  Um, I just read about a procedure, bariatric surgery, that-- Do you read the New Yorker at all?  No?
1:15 1:15 FEMALE: I do.
1:18 1:26 MALE: Well, so, there was this uh, I think it was maybe-- New Yorker or New York Metro, um, and it was a procedure basically makes people lose like, you know, like 200 pounds by stapling their stomach.
1:24 1:26 FEMALE: Yeah, I have read about it.
1:28 1:29 MALE: Did you read this article?
1:27 1:29 FEMALE: I've read other articles about it, but yeah.
1:31 1:36 MALE: The interesting thing is that the uh, what happens is if the women, most of the people that do it are women, like 80 percent.
1:34 1:34 FEMALE: Right.
1:36 1:56 MALE: So, if the women who had bariatric surgery um, were married to guys when they were thin first, and then they got, you know, fat, then their married got much better.  But if they were fat when they got married, then they find out, if the husband has kind of been disrespecting them the whole time, and soon they get their colors done, and you know, they just kind of like, you know, usually those marriages end in divorce after they get the surgery.  So--
1:55 1:56 FEMALE: That's kind of sad.
1:58 2:00 MALE: It's kind of sad, but uh, I thought it was very interesting.  
1:58 2:04 FEMALE: No, that is really interesting.  I actually had read somewhere that divorce rates tend to go up after- after bariatric surgery.
2:06 2:07 MALE: This is also my-- Oh, sorry, go ahead.
2:06 2:07 FEMALE: Well, no, what were you going to say?
2:09 2:24 MALE: I just feel, that's my hypothesis for why divorce rates have risen in modern culture, because the more concentrated you are, in a city for example, the more times you see people who are somewhat more attractive than the person you're currently with.  And so either you start thinking, you know, the primitive brain starts going on, you know.  
2:22 2:30 FEMALE: But I always had the impression that divorce rates have been high in general in cultures in which there isn't a major divorce stigma.  Like ancient Rome--
2:31 2:31 MALE: Okay, interesting.
2:30 2:32 FEMALE: --had like a similar divorce rate to what we have.
2:34 2:34 MALE: ReallY?
2:33 2:33 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:35 2:35 MALE: I did not know that.
2:34 2:34 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:36 2:41 MALE: 'Cause I've just seen, you know, it's been rising since like, you know, the advent of urbanization within--
2:39 2:39 FEMALE: Right.
2:41 2:43 MALE: --our contemporary period.  But I didn't know that uh--
2:41 2:44 FEMALE: I think it's sort of an economic thing, that as long as there were like-- 
2:46 2:47 MALE: 'Cause women have you know--
2:45 2:48 FEMALE: --major incentives not to get divorced, because it would put you in so much a worse position.
2:50 2:54 MALE: Right.  But now people are much more economically self-sufficient, somewhat more atomized, so-- 
2:52 2:52 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:54 2:54 MALE: So, yeah.
2:53 2:53 FEMALE: Yeah.  But--
2:56 2:56 MALE: Anyway.
2:54 2:59 FEMALE: And then, if they can have surgery to get thin, apparently that also makes it-- [laughter]
3:01 3:04 MALE: Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you've seen these "Extreme Makeover" uh shows.
3:02 3:03 FEMALE: I try of avoid that kind of thing.
3:05 3:10 MALE: Yeah, I mean, I'm not, I'm not like a big fan, but it's just more like gawking at a traffic accident, like--
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:10 3:17 MALE: Now- now that you can stream it over the web, it's just like, you know, do you know what I'm talking about, like basically you can download any TV show now.
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Oh, okay. 
3:18 3:23 MALE: So like in between, like I'm an engineer, so when I'm running a process I'll just like watch a show in- in the middle.
3:21 3:21 FEMALE: I see.
3:21 3:26 MALE: And so, the stuff they can do to these people is unbelievable.  Uh--
3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Yeah, it's kind of scary.  I mean--
3:28 3:29 MALE: It's not very natural.  But uh--
3:28 3:32 FEMALE: No, well it always makes me concerned about like the functioning of their bodies in the future.  Like--
3:34 3:34 MALE: Right.
3:33 3:34 FEMALE: --I mean there's got to be consequences to--
3:36 3:36 MALE: It's surgery.
3:35 3:39 FEMALE: --like 90 percent reducing the absorptive capacity of your intestines.  Like you know?
3:40 3:43 MALE: Yes, that's- that's extreme.  I agree, I agree.  
3:40 3:40 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:43 3:48 MALE: Oh, and then you know, you can see all these stars who can't move their face anymore, because they've just been botoxed to, you know.
3:46 3:47 FEMALE: Yeah.  [unintelligible]
3:49 3:53 MALE: To-- and did you see uh, "Jib Jab"?  Do you know what I'm talking about at all?
3:51 3:51 FEMALE: No.
3:53 3:56 MALE: No?  Okay.  Uh, it's this political satire that went around, and--
3:54 3:54 FEMALE: Okay.
3:57 4:03 MALE: One of the things was must be like John Kerrey had gotten botoxed, and so that's why he couldn't smile during the debates.  [horn]  Supposedly.  Anyway.  
4:01 4:01 FEMALE: Ouch.
4:02 4:06 MALE: Pretty cold.  Okay, hey, nice meeting you.
4:04 4:04 FEMALE: Good to meet you.
