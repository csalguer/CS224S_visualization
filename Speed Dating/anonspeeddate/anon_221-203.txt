0:25 0:26 MALE: Oh, that's nice.

0:27 0:28 FEMALE: How do you like it here?

0:28 0:31 MALE: I really like it.  It's a nice change from the Arctic tundra I grew up in, so...

0:31 0:32 FEMALE: [laughter].  What part of Canada are you from?

0:33 0:37 MALE: Edmonton, Alberta.  Wayne Gretzky played hockey there, the world's largest shopping mall, that's about it.

0:37 0:39 FEMALE: I know, I've heard it -- of it, you know.

0:39 0:39 MALE: Oh, there you go.

0:40 0:40 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:41 0:42 MALE: It puts you ahead of most people.  

0:42 0:42 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:42 0:46 MALE: Where is that?  Calgary?  No, Alberta.  North of Montana, and usually it's okay.

0:46 0:47 FEMALE: They think cold place, yeah.

0:47 0:49 MALE: Yeah, they think cold place, barren wasteland.

0:49 0:51 FEMALE: So are you -- how close are you to finishing?

0:52 0:59  MALE: Yeah, uh, better question for my adviser than me.  Uh, probably a couple of years.  It's uh -- people in my group were just finishing who are year seven.

0:59 0:59 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:00 1:01 MALE: So, a long haul.

1:01 1:03 FEMALE: Do you know what you want to do, after?

1:03 1:09  MALE: Uh, most of the people in my field are very oil-exploration-related, so most likely work for an oil company.

1:09 1:09 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:10 1:14 MALE: Which I know is, uh, very popular among people in California, but yeah.

1:14 1:14 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:15 1:18 MALE: Someone has to put fuel in people's obnoxiously-sized SUVs.

1:19 1:20 FEMALE: Right, and it might as well be you.

1:21 1:22 MALE: I guess, yeah.

1:23 1:24 FEMALE: What else do you like to do?

1:24 1:36 MALE: Uh, let's see.  I enjoy cooking and museum-hopping, going to the Cander [phonetic] Center.  I used to really like politics, I was heavily involved in Canada.  Being a Canadian here I [unintelligible] myself the need for that.

1:36 1:36 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:36 1:39 MALE: I [unintelligible] GSC, a GCS hack for awhile a few years back.

1:40 1:40 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:40 1:45 MALE: Um, yeah beyond that, I think that's about it.  How about yourself?

1:45 1:57 FEMALE: I don't know.  I was trying to like -- people keep asking me what I like to do, and it's really just kind of like be mellow, hang out with friends, and hang out in coffee shops and... I live in EV [phonetic], so they plan fun events that I like to go --

1:57 1:57 MALE: Yeah, there you go.

1:58 2:14 FEMALE: - go on, and try to meet people.  I like kayaking in the fall, I went to a little nursery last quarter.  Went to Tahoe for the first time on a ski trip, and um, yeah other than that, just kind of hang out, read, try to get shit done, work.

2:15 2:21 MALE: So coffee shop, you like -- it seems like all the people I know who go to coffee shops, like Cuba [phonetic] Caf'e.  Have you been there, in Palo Alto, or...?

2:21 2:21 FEMALE: No.

2:21 2:22 MALE: The Venezuelan place?  It's very good.

2:22 2:29 FEMALE: I haven't.  I've heard about it many, many times, but I don't believe I've ever been there.  I just go up to Starbucks mostly, because I'm right there from EV.

2:30 2:32 MALE: Oh, the one on Stanford and Milton [phonetic], you know, yeah. 

2:31 2:38 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  So -- 'cause I can't really, I can't really focus on work in my room, 'cause it's like -- that's like my living space, and so -

2:38 2:38 MALE: Yeah, I can understand.

2:39 2:41 FEMALE: - you know, I need to get out and be somewhere, and so...

2:42 2:45 MALE: Starbucks, the thing that got me lately, because that Chantico [phonetic] stuff was like crack.

2:46 2:47 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:47 2:48 MALE: It was so bad.

2:49 2:49 FEMALE: I know.

2:50 2:50 MALE: It was this scalding hot -- it's just melted chocolate bars.

2:50 2:52 FEMALE: I know, I've had it.  But it's good, it's really good.  

2:52 2:52 MALE: It's so good.

2:52 2:55 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah, I spend most of my discretionary money at Starbucks, I'd say.	 

2:56 3:04 MALE: Yeah.  What freaked me out is a friend of mine sent me the nutritional info for the Chantico.  I looked at that, and it's like eating two chocolate bars, because I think it is two chocolate bars.

3:04 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.

3:05 3:14 MALE: Yeah, Starbucks -- people bad mouth Starbucks and say, "Oh, I'm not going to [unintelligible] but you go -- the coffee's actually quite -- I'll go to like some little independent coffee shop, and the coffee sucks -

3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:15 3:16 MALE: - and the service is bad.

3:17 3:17 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:17 3:22 MALE: And that's what you're going to get.  You go to Starbucks and it's going to be strong, consistent, relatively good coffee.

3:22 3:22 FEMALE: Right.

3:23 3:23 MALE: If you like that type of coffee.  So I'm like, yeah.

3:23 3:33 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm torn about it, you know, because I'm not a big fan of the whole, like, corporate conformity of the world kind of thing, but you know, it's just a nice place to spend time, you know?  It's a nice atmosphere.

3:34 3:41 MALE: It's true, like the whole -- the corporate conformity thing, that didn't really hit me until driving through town, you see the same Bed, Bath and Beyond, Starbucks.

3:41 3:41 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:42 3:43 MALE: Everywhere looks the same.  And especially when you travel.

3:44 3:44 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:44 3:48 MALE: But if you don't travel, I guess, and stay in the same place, you're happy, you think your place is unique, and not exactly like everywhere else.

3:48 3:51 FEMALE: It's my own personal Starbucks, it's at the corner where I go.

3:52 3:56 MALE: Yeah, it was really weird, because I was -- yeah, I got back from a trip to Asia over spring break.

3:56 3:56 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

3:56 3:57 MALE: I was in Shanghai.

3:57 3:57 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

3:57 4:01 MALE: Went into Starbucks and it was like, "I'm in Palo Alto."

4:01 4:01 [Background Noise]

4:01 4:01 FEMALE: Yeah.

4:01 4:03 MALE: Yeah, it was quite odd.

4:04 4:04 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

4:05 4:05 MALE: Nice to meet you, female221, as well.

4:06 4:07 FEMALE: Maybe see you at the Nuthouse sometime.

4:07 4:08 MALE: Probably will on a Thursday, yeah.

4:08 4:09 FEMALE: [laughter].
