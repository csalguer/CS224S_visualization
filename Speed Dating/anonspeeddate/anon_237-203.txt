00:01  00:01	MALE:  Yeah [horn].
00:02  00:04	FEMALE:  Sorry.  We got behind.  You can blame him.
00:04  00:05	MALE:  Oh, no problem.  Just that horn.
00:06  00:08	FEMALE:  Yeah, It's getting a little.  Oh, well, I'll fill it out later.
00:09  00:10	MALE:  I feel like I'm at a hockey game.
00:11  00:12	FEMALE:  That's the atmosphere we're their trying to cultivate.
00:13  00:16	MALE:  female237?
00:17  00:17	FEMALE:  female237.
00:18  00:18	MALE:  female237.  male203.
00:19  00:22	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  So how do you like the microphone [laughter]?
00:23  00:27	MALE:  Yeah, I'm trying to ignore it, but ah, I just keep on talking to it and do it to self.
00:28  00:33	FEMALE:  It's kind of handy in other circumstances to have a microphone handy.
00:34  00:39	MALE:  Yeah, I  think I don't know you ever saw Saved by the Bell kind of kid or Zach Morris note to self, let's do this.
00:40  00:45	FEMALE:  Right.  Well you know there's a reason doctor's dictate and whatever.  The rest of us just start.
00:46  00:48	MALE:  Oh, sure.  Okay, you can't really picture hearing my own voice. 
00:49  00:50	FEMALE:  It's a listening thing.
00:51  00:52	MALE:  Do I sound like that, oh.
00:52  00:58	FEMALE:  Right.  I think developed one that sort of transformed your voice into like something more pleasant to listen to after.
00:59  01:02	MALE:  Yeah, yeah, like a Barry White - a-phone, or something.
01:03  01:07	FEMALE:  Great idea [laughter].  I'm sure there are some engineers around here.
01:08  01:10	MALE:  Bud, my roommate, he sort into the audio stuff.
01:11  01:11	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:12  01:13	MALE:  So which program are you in?
01:14  01:15	FEMALE:  I'm in the Ed school.
01:16  01:16	MALE:  Ah, okay.
01:17  01:20	FEMALE:  Like the train of people you've talked to before me.  Um, so what --
01:21  01:22	MALE:  I'm in geophysics, you probably met one other.
01:23  01:24	FEMALE:  Oh there was another geophysics guy.
01:25  01:29	MALE:  A guy in my group is -- another guy in my group knows nameX [phonetic] and that's nameX.
01:30  01:31	FEMALE:  I see, that's the geophysics connection.
01:32  01:33	MALE:  Yeah, that's the geophysics are coming from.
01:34  01:36	FEMALE:  All right.  So how long have you been doing the geophysics thing?
01:37  01:39	MALE:  I got my undergrad in it and I'm in year five of the PhD right now.
01:40  01:40	FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
01:41  01:42	MALE:  So, long haul, a while to go.
01:43  01:44	FEMALE:  Did you go straight between from your undergrad to here or?
01:45  01:58	MALE:  Pretty much.  I took ah -- during my undergrad was a really long internship program.  So I went for a year and half during undergrad.  So I had a bit of a small break in the real world, but for the most part I'm still hold up in the ivory tower.
01:59  02:03	FEMALE:  But with geophysics you should be able to get outside, right?  Like you're not really hold up in like a citadel [laughter]?
02:04  02:09	MALE:  Well, yeah.  Sure enough.  So which, which -- so are you getting a Master's or PhD?
02:10  02:10	FEMALE:  Masters.
02:11  02:11	MALE:  Masters?
02:12  02:12	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:12  02:13	MALE:  So your first or second year or?
02:14  02:15	FEMALE:  First year.  It's a year one --.
02:15  02:16	MALE:  It's a one year thing.  Okay.
02:17  02:19	FEMALE:  It's all one year Master's program.  So -- yeah, they get us in and out.
02:20  02:21	MALE:  So you know where you're heading to after this?
02:21  02:25	FEMALE:  Not at all.  I'm applying for jobs all over.  We'll see what comes to it.
02:26  02:27	MALE:  Applying jobs as a teacher?
02:28  02:30	FEMALE:  No, no. I'm actually interested in Education Journalism.
02:31  02:31	MALE:  Ah, okay.
02:32  02:34	FEMALE:  So, mostly journalism jobs.  There's this one oral historian position that looks kind of neat.
02:35  02:35	MALE:  Cool.
02:36  02:41	FEMALE:  Yeah, so I don't know what all I'll be doing or where it will be [laughter].
02:42  02:43	MALE:  Well, that will be -- that will be an interesting field.
02:44  02:44	FEMALE:  I hope so, you know.
02:45  02:46	MALE:  Stuff
02:47  02:51	FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean, it's becoming sort of a growing field with no child left behind and what not.
02:52  02:53	MALE:  Oh, I don't think I quite fully understand the no child left behind.
02:54  02:54	FEMALE:  Well no one does.
02:55  02:57	MALE:  Underperforming schools are shut down, some people like that some people don't --
02:58  02:58	FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean --
02:59  03:00	MALE:  That's as far as my understanding goes.
03:01  03:04	FEMALE:  It's just a 700 page or so congressional bill and no one really knows everything that's in it [laughter].
03:05  03:05	MALE:  Yeah.
03:06  03:06	FEMALE:  It's a catchy name [laughter].
03:07  03:08	MALE:   Oh, definitely.  It's like murder is a bad deal, yeah.  
03:09  03:10	FEMALE:  That's right.
03:11  03:12	MALE:  The kid's are good.  Yeah.  Great
03:13  03:13	FEMALE:  I love those.
03:14  03:15	MALE:  Love those kids.
03:16  03:20	FEMALE:  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, you know it keeps a certain industry at a minimal [laughter].
03:21  03:26	MALE:  Oh definitely, and then I -- I guess the whole California thing as well must be -- with Schwarzenegger and [unintelligible] fighting.
03:27  03:29	FEMALE:  Oh yeah, it's great.  Might as well just start going.
03:30  03:34	MALE:  Yeah, with teacher's tenure and all sorts of stuff and then pink slips around here.  There's probably tons of stuff going on.
03:35  03:43	FEMALE:  Oh, this area I mean  San Francisco unified is fairly well known for giving tons of pink slips in the Spring and then hiring people back in August.
03:44  03:47	MALE:  Yeah.  You know I think if they handed ten pink slips that might get actually get laid off -- 
03:48  03:48	FEMALE:  Yeah.
03:50  03:51	MALE:  Which will probably be the provisional pink slip looking for [unintelligible].  I don't quite --
03:52  03:59	FEMALE:  Right.  It's really weird.  I don't totally get it.  I've just mostly heard like the horror stories from people who have been on the receiving end of the pink slip and then gotten rehired or [horn].
04:00  04:02 	MALE:  Yeah.
04:03  04:03	FEMALE:  All right well.
04:03  04:04	MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
04:04  04:05	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you [laughter].
