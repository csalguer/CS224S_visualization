0:55 0:56 MALE: Where's San Lorenzo?
0:43 0:54 FEMALE: It's right off of 92. You take 92 east, go up 80 for two exits, it's right there. It's kind of in the middle of no where. It's like industrial parks and my teacher occupation.

0:55 0:55 FEMALE: New Jersey.
1:10 1:10 MALE: Whereabouts?
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: Bridgewater, New Jersey. Are you familiar with New Jersey?
1:13 1:32 MALE: I am actually. My ex-girlfriend, grew up in-- Well maybe I'm not so familiar, actually. I used to know this. Northern New Jersey. Really, this is horrible anyway, let's not talk about that but. So how did you come out here?
1:19 1:21 FEMALE: Well I was working in New York City.
1:35 1:35 MALE: Westfield.
1:23 1:25 FEMALE: Westfield, okay. That's actually pretty near to where I grew up.
1:39 1:39 MALE: Oh really? 
1:26 1:26 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:41 1:41 MALE: There you go.
1:28 1:39 FEMALE: But New Jersey's weird, everything's pretty near. Oh yeah. I know just where that is, my cousin's second-- anyway. Everybody has a story from someone who lived in New Jersey. But I was living in New York City and I didn't want to do that anymore.
1:54 1:54 MALE: Where in New York were you?
1:41 1:53 FEMALE: I worked at Arista Records in Midtown and I just didn't want to be there anymore. The company I was working for wasn't doing great so I moved out here.
2:06 2:07 MALE: Where did you go to undergrad?	
1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Carnegie Mellon.
2:10 2:10 MALE: In Pittsburgh.
1:56 1:59 FEMALE: Yeah. You know where it is.

2:16 2:19 MALE: Yeah. I am, actually. You're jumping ahead in the questions.
2:06 2:06 FEMALE: Sorry.
2:22 2:29  MALE: No. I'll tell you about me. I grew up in San Diego, I went here undergrad then I went to work actually.
2:13 2:13 FEMALE: Oh. What did you do?
2:32 2:39 MALE: I worked in banking and I did that for two years in New York and then I was transferred to our Paris office. It was just for a year but I ended up staying for four years. Then last fall I moved back to [unintelligible].
2:27 2:29 FEMALE: That's nice. So you're finishing your first year or your second.
2:43 2:44 MALE: I finished my first year.
2:31 2:31 FEMALE: Oh, okay.
2:47 2:48 MALE: I'll actually be in New York for the summer.
2:35 2:35 FEMALE: You're going to be in New York this summer?
2:50 2:55 MALE: Yeah. I'm not so thrilled about it. I thought I was done with New York, so.
2:41 2:44 FEMALE: New York in the summer is kind of rough, kind of stinky. 
2:57 3:00 MALE: Tell me about it, but oh well.
2:47 2:51 FEMALE: I'll probably spend a lot of time in New York this summer, too. My whole family lives there.
3:04 3:06 MALE: Just for the area and everything. Well there you go.
2:52 2:56 FEMALE: Not super excited about it. But actually I miss my family a lot living out here so it's nice to--
3:10 3:11 MALE: Did you have a big family?
2:58 2:58 FEMALE: No. I just living far away. When I was living there, I can't wait to get out of here. Now I have twinges of...
3:18 3:20 MALE: How did you choose to come out here to Stanford?
3:00 3:04 FEMALE: I actually moved out here before so I had lived here for two years before I came to Stanford.
3:26 3:29 MALE: And obviously you want to stay in the Bay area, so?	
3:07 3:13 FEMALE: Yeah. For a while, I like it here, no reason to go. And I feel like New York will always be there.
3:38 3:39 MALE: I've been a fan of this city, too.
3:15 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah. I'm moving to San Francisco over the summer so I'm in for a long commute but I'm really sick of this south bay. I've been a south bay living tour.
3:49 3:54 MALE: Person B over there who is also in your program is also moving to San Francisco.
3:42 3:45 FEMALE: Yes. I know her quite well. We teach in the same classroom everyday. 
3:58 3:59 MALE: Well there you go.
3:46 3:47 FEMALE: She's actually my best friend.
4:02 4:03 MALE: Pleasure to meet you.
