0:58 1:01 MALE: Oh really?  Uh have you got a job lined up?

0:59 1:02 FEMALE: I'm, I'm from Singapore, so, um.

1:02 1:03 MALE: Oh okay.

1:02 1:05 FEMALE: The Singapore government sponsored my education here. So I'm going back to work for them.  

1:08 1:11 MALE: Ah, is that their requirement for the--yeah, I have a friend who's uh--

1:09 1:10 FEMALE: Indentured servitude, basically.

1:12 1:13 MALE: Yeah.  

1:10 1:11 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:13 1:16 MALE: My friend is from Thailand and she has to come back for ten years or something, for a very long--

1:13 1:14 FEMALE: Ten is very long.

1:16 1:18 MALE: It's a very long period of time.

1:14 1:15 FEMALE: I thought six was bad, but--

1:18 1:19 MALE: Have you been back to--

1:16 1:17 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:19 1:21 MALE: I've heard Singapore is very nice.  I've never been and always meant to go.

1:18 1:28 FEMALE: It is.  Um well, that's where my family is, so I'm a little bit biased, I must say.  But uh, well, America's been good to me.  I've been here for holidays, and now I'm here.  I like it.

1:31 1:32 MALE: What did you do for uh undergrad?

1:29 1:31 FEMALE: Um I did econ at Yale.

1:34 1:35 MALE: Oh okay. 

1:33 1:34 FEMALE: What about you?  Were you at Stanford too or--?

1:36  1:42 MALE: Uh University of Alberta in Canada.  So I'm from--my family's from Canada, and so I just came down here for grad school.

1:39 1:42 FEMALE: Yeah.  Must be terrible culture shock, mm--hmm.  [laughter] 

1:45 1:49 MALE: It's, it's--the--there are differences, but they're so minor.

1:47 1:51 FEMALE: One of my classes had this uh commercial--what is the Canadian beer?  Starts with M?

1:53 1:54 MALE: Molson.

1:52 1:54 FEMALE: Yes.  Molson had this uh what, what does it mean to be Canadian.

1:56 1:57 MALE: Oh, the I am Canadian, yeah.

1:55 1:58 FEMALE: With the, yes, with the bear and whatever, and it--

1:59 2:08 MALE: It's so minor.  There's these minor little minutia details [unintelligible].  Okay.  Canada has a national healthcare system, like every other country except the U.S.

2:05 2:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:08 2:13 MALE: There's a few differences in words, a tiny difference in accent, and it's colder outside.

2:10 2:13 FEMALE: But it's good to differentiate, right?  Everybody wants to feel unique, right?

2:15 2:18 MALE: Oh, especially now with people traveling, it's like, oh, I'm Canadian, don't blame me for all this crap.

2:16 2:20 FEMALE: A lot of my American friends, they put Canadian flags when they go [unintelligible].

2:21 2:22 MALE: Yeah.  I've heard of that.

2:21 2:22 FEMALE: That's so stupid.

2:23 2:36 MALE: There's actually a company in the U.S. somewhere that's actually selling a Canadian disguise kit, or something like that, where they get like a pennant.  That's one thing that's kind of obnoxious with Canadians that are traveling is they're obsessed with putting, like, labels in their backpack and--

2:33 2:34 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:37 2:40 MALE: I'm Canadian, by the way.  And I don't see the point, but.

2:38 2:41 FEMALE: So first they go to war, then now they try to pretend that they never did.

2:42 2:44 MALE: Yeah exactly.

2:41 2:42 FEMALE: And they're not American, okay.  

2:44 2:45 MALE: Exactly.

2:43 2:46 FEMALE: Which part are you from?  I've been to Canada a few times, but not--

2:48 2:49 MALE: Really, where have you been?

2:47 2:48 FEMALE: Well, I've been to Vancouver.

2:50 2:51 MALE: Oh Vancouver's--

2:48 2:49 FEMALE: To Toronto.

2:51 2:54 MALE: Vancouver's one of the nicest [unintelligible].

2:49 2:55 FEMALE: I, I, it is nice, but I must say the shock of having so many Asians in one place scared me.  

2:58 2:59 MALE: [laughter] I was gonna say--

2:55 2:58 FEMALE: And I'm from Singapore, where we only have 4 million people, though.  So it never--and we also have different races in Singapore.

3:02 3:03 MALE: Yeah.  

3:00 3:06 FEMALE: So it's not all Chinese.  There are Malays in Singapore, there are Indians, and there are also Caucasians.  So I always felt in a, like, a cosmopolitan place.

3:08 3:12 MALE: Vancouver had the mass Hong Kong exodus right before '97.  So.

3:09 3:10 FEMALE: Yeah.  Oh my gosh, it's like Asia-land.

3:14 3:22 MALE: Oh it's crazy.  Yeah.  There's like these uh shopping malls in Richmond, south of Vancouver, that are--you go inside them, it's like--I, I was in China, in Shanghai about three or four weeks ago, it was--

3:19 3:20 FEMALE: Do you speak Chinese?

3:23 3:25 MALE: No.  I--nihow [phonetic].  

3:20 3:21 FEMALE: You just--

3:26 3:29 MALE: Nihow [phonetic], shushik [phonetic], woo [phonetic], that was about it.  That was about all I got, so the--

3:25 3:26 FEMALE: You were just there traveling or--?  

3:30 3:34 MALE: Yeah.  I was traveling.  I was uh with my brother and my roommate, my friend.  We went to Japan and China.

3:32 3:36 FEMALE: That's awesome.  They're the two places I want to go, because, uh, I'm learning Japanese now, and I am sort of Chinese by ancestry--

3:40 3:41 MALE: Yeah.  

3:37 3:39 FEMALE: --so I would love to go to China someday.

3:42 3:48 MALE: Japanese uh the, the tonality of Chinese just made it--I, I'm not [unintelligible].

3:44 3:48 FEMALE: Does anyone speak English at all?  In Shanghai I would guess so, right?

3:50 3:52 MALE: [unintelligible] much better than Japan actually.

3:48 3:49 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:52 3:54 MALE: It was uh people had far better accents.

3:50 3:54 FEMALE: Do you know in Japan they teach English apparently in the schools, but they don't teach it well--

3:57 3:58 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:55 3:59 FEMALE: --which means everybody can, yeah, everybody learns a little bit and they try to practice it on every foreigner they meet.  Is that true?

4:02 4:05 MALE: Um, pretty much, yeah, like for the most part we were in Tokyo, and so--[horn].

4:03 4:04 FEMALE: Oh yeah.

4:07 4:08 MALE: Ah.

4:05 4:07 FEMALE: Yeah.  It was nice to meet you anyway.  Yeah.
