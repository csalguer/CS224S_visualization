1:38 1:38 MALE: Yeah. How about you?
1:38 1:49 FEMALE: I'm finishing my Masters degree in education. So I'm going to teach high school math so I'm almost done. I'll be done on June 12th.

2:01 2:01 MALE: On the other side of the bay.
2:02 2:05 FEMALE: Yeah. So we'll see; it will be exciting.
2:08 2:09 MALE: What do you do in your spare time?
2:11 2:21 FEMALE: I like to spend my spare time outside, going on hikes or playing tennis. I don't know, I don't have a whole lot of spare time right now as I'm sure you probably don't either.
2:21 2:22 MALE: Right. Because you have a very intense program.
2:26 2:29 FEMALE: Yeah. But I like living in California a lot because
2:27 2:28 MALE: Where are you originally from?
2:30 2:44 FEMALE: I'm originally from New Jersey so I've been in California for three years which is nice. I'm moving up to San Francisco next year which will be, I think, more interesting than living in Palo Alto. How about you? What do you do in your free time?
