0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  Hi.

0:03 0:04 MALE:  Hey, female221.  Nice to meet you.  male214.

0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  What do you do?

0:06 0:15 MALE:  I am mechanical engineering master student and I will be finishing this quarter.  And then I'll be doing another masters in aerospace starting next quarter.

0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  And then what?

0:16 0:19 MALE:  And then I'm going to try to be an astronaut.

0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  Really?

0:21 0:25 MALE:  Everybody does.  Well, probably what I will be doing is designing rockets.  [laughter].  Hopefully.

0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  That's pretty cool.

0:27 0:29 MALE:  Or space vehicles that's--that's more of the generic term.

0:29 0:32 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Awesome.  What did you do before?

0:33 0:40 MALE:  I worked as an engineer for Proctor and Gamble and I worked on Crest toothpaste and toothpaste tubes.

0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

0:41 0:50 MALE:  I worked on Crest white strips, so one of my toothbrushes got up to market and the toothpaste tubes and, blah, blah, blah.  And then I worked at Always in my final year at P&G.

0:51 0:51 FEMALE:  P&G.

0:51 1:01 MALE:  Always.  Yeah.  I--I didn't design the products for obvious reasons, but I did design the machinery that made the products.  And then I decided that I wanted to do aerospace and I was no where close to doing it.

1:01 1:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's the hardest [unintelligible] different.

1:04 1:04 MALE:  Yeah.

1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  So.

1:05 1:06 MALE:  Right, so I just--

1:06 1:11 FEMALE:  --you just have to kind of [unintelligible] to that [unintelligible] just jump in [unintelligible].

1:11 1:13 MALE:  Oh, you mean--oh, oh, aerospace [unintelligible], no I--I already knew.

1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

1:14 1:16 MALE:  I knew since I was little, but I just didn't do it because of the job market.

1:17 1:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:18 1:21 MALE:  But then because of the [unintelligible] it--it changed--it changed the market significantly.

1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  Right.

1:22 1:22 MALE:  So, now I can jump in.

1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Cool.

1:23 1:24 MALE:  What do you do?

1:24 1:26 FEMALE:  Uh, I'm a first year Ph.D. student in Russian literature.

1:27 1:27 MALE:  In Russian literature?

1:28 1:28 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

1:29 1:29 MALE:  Oh, okay.  

1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:29 1:30 MALE:  My sister speaks Russian.

1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  Really?

1:31 1:32 MALE:  Yeah.  And she's taught me a few words and I forgot.

1:32 1:33 FEMALE:  What do you know?

1:33 1:33 MALE:  I forgot.  [laughter].

1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]. 

1:35 1:36 MALE:  I mean, if I heard it I would know.

1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:37 1:41 MALE:  Like she would tell me hello and that's--that's the only remember [unintelligible].  And then she went to Russia twice.

1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:42 1:45 MALE:  Because she was on the first foreign exchange program from the US to Russia.

1:45 1:45 FEMALE:  When was that?

1:46 1:50 MALE:  It was in 1989.  She met Bush, uh, the smart one.

1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:51 1:52 MALE:  And she met Gorbachev.

1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:54 1:54 MALE:  Yeah.

1:55 1:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's a great field, it's very interesting.

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Yeah, that's what she said.

1:58 2:02 FEMALE:  It's complex and crazy country.  [unintelligible].

2:03 2:07 MALE:  So, you must have dived in right into--to graduate school, right, when you came out of under grad?

2:07 2:10 FEMALE:  No, actually I worked for five years and went to law school for a year and a half.

2:10 2:10 MALE:  Oh, really.

2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:11 2:12 MALE:  Wow.

2:12 2:14 FEMALE:  And then I decided I didn't want to be a lawyer.

2:14 2:14 MALE:  Okay.

2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  But I wanted to come back to school so.

2:16 2:16 MALE:  Okay.

2:17 2:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

2:17 2:17 MALE:  Cool.

2:18 2:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It was a good choice.  I mean, I liked law school.  I always like [unintelligible], but, uh, I went worked at some really horrible law firms [unintelligible], you know, [unintelligible] not to be a lawyer come talk to me and you know horrible moral and you know.

2:30 2:30 MALE:  Oh, I see.

2:31 2:32 FEMALE:  So, it just didn't seem very [unintelligible].

2:32 2:32 MALE:  Yeah.

2:33 2:37 FEMALE:  And I worked for a firm that was really great and if I had actually worked there [unintelligible] then maybe I wouldn't it matter.

2:37 2:41 MALE:  So, what motivated you to do Russian?  Are you--the Russian background or...?

2:41 2:46 FEMALE:  No, no, I, um, the story goes when I was 11 years old I went to Japan for a junior art camp there--

2:46 2:47 MALE:  Wow.

2:47 2:53 FEMALE:  --[unintelligible] are all over the world there.  And there was this cute Russian boy who [unintelligible] that was it and then I wanted to learn Russian.

2:53 2:53 MALE:  Oh, I see.

2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:55 2:55 MALE:  Cool.

2:55 3:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, so, um, I studied it in high school and college and, uh--

3:01 3:01 MALE:  Where did you go to college?

3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  Dartmouth.

3:02 3:03 MALE:  Oh, okay, great.

3:03 3:04 FEMALE:  How about you?

3:04 3:05 MALE:  I went to Carnegie Mellon.  

3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

3:06 3:06 MALE:  In Pittsburgh.

3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:07 3:07 MALE:  Nice and snowy.

3:08 3:08 FEMALE:  Where are you from originally?

3:09 3:10 MALE:  Gray--I'm from Houston.

3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  How do you like California?

3:12 3:14 MALE:  It's much better.  It's the best place I've ever lived.

3:14 3:14 FEMALE:  Really.

3:15 3:17 MALE:  The weather is great.  I like--I like the fact that it's cold at night.

3:18 3:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of a nice change you're not sweltering.

3:21 3:22 MALE:  I don't need an AC.

3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  Right.

3:23 3:25 MALE:  Yeah, you know, 'cause usually you need an AC when you go to bed.

3:25 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, I like it too.  I, uh, even though I'm from Oregon originally and, uh, I got this kind of [unintelligible] of California because as [unintelligible] the myth goes that Californians go up to Oregon and [unintelligible] our beautiful state.  But, um, so, I refused to consider going to school here or ever living here and so I came home after college and realized that I really wanted some sun and, uh, even though, I mean, I know Northern California is, you know, not like Southern California.  I just kind of expected it to be [unintelligible] in shorts [unintelligible] all the time.

3:52 3:52 MALE:  Okay.

3:53 3:56 FEMALE:  But it's nice because it's kind of [unintelligible] similar to home, the weather [unintelligible] a little better.

3:57 3:58 MALE:  Right.

3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, but, yeah.

4:00 4:01 MALE:  That was quick.  Nice to meet you.

4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  Bye.
