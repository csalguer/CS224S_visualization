0:19 0:19 MALE:  Let's not do this.   
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  No, right.  
0:22 0:23 MALE:  What's more important, body or brains?  
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  Say it again?  What's more important? 
0:26 0:31 MALE:  What's more important, rank this personality, brains, body.  
0:32 0:32 FEMALE: Mm.  
0:32 0:33 MALE:  In order of importance.  
0:34 0:47 FEMALE:  Personality, hmm., well like body--are we assuming there's minimum standards of like not egregious like, one way or another?  
0:48 0:48 MALE:  Just answer the question, damn it.   
0:49 0:53 FEMALE:  [laughter] All right, so personality, intelligence, body. 
0:54 0:54 MALE:  Wow.  
0:55 0:55 FEMALE:  But it depends. 
0:55 0:55 MALE:  That's a very PC answer.  
0:56 1:07 FEMALE:  Well, but you said body, and I think that's very male, [laughter], because I say looks is like different then body, in my mind.  Is it different for you?  
1:08 1:10 MALE:  I think it's a package, but I'm asking the questions here.  
1:11 1:14 FEMALE:  [laughter] Why are you asking the questions here?  What about you? 
1:15 1:16 MALE:  Because I'm being assertive.  Um--
1:17 1:19 FEMALE:  [laughter] Assertive--well I'll write you right here, check.
1:20 1:20 MALE:  Uh--
1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  Oh this is the other person.
1:22 1:26 MALE:  Uh, definitely for me, personality, body, attractive, body and [unintelligible]. 
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  Well if you're saying body is like attractiveness too--
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:29 1:36 FEMALE:  --just overall attractiveness, I'd rank it in second too.  I agree.  Um, any other burning questions?  
1:37 1:39 MALE:  When was the last relationship you were in? 
1:40 1:43 FEMALE:  It's been a long time.  Damn long time, too long.  College. 
1:44 1:44 MALE:  How long was that relationship? 
1:45 1:49 FEMALE:  Short.  [laughter] Two months.  What about you? 
1:50 1:55 MALE:  I have been in and out of a relationship for eight months.  
1:56 1:56 FEMALE:  You're in a relationship right now aren't you?  
1:57 1:57 MALE:  I just got out of it. 
1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  Admit it.  [laughter] 
1:59 2:03 MALE:  Nah.  I broke up before tonight and I just had to quit.   
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  You knew this was coming up, so--
2:05 2:05 MALE:  [laughter] 
2:06 2:10 FEMALE:  --she's waiting in the wings.  [laughter] Um--
2:11 2:12 MALE:  Would you date someone at the business school? 
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  Would I?  Yeah.  
2:15 2:19 MALE:  Have you been interested in people at the business school before?  Have you dated at the business school?  
2:20 2:28 FEMALE:  No.  Well the thing is, it's like, it's the fishbowl thing, right?  You know, like everybody knows, everybody talks.  I've heard that the guys have this E-mail list that they send around.
2:29 2:29 MALE:  A lie.   
2:30 2:47 FEMALE:  I have people like confirm, but I've never seen it myself, but it's just, it's hard because it is such a small class that you know, if it's, if it's exploratory dating then--I think exploratory dating is impossible.  But you've been here longer, what do you think?  
2:48 2:50 MALE:  I've dated at the GSB.  It's a horrible idea.   
2:51 2:59 FEMALE:  [laughter] See, my suspicions have been confirmed.   What's horrible about it?  Just because of like what I was saying?  
3:00 3:00 MALE:  Everyone talks.  
3:00 3:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's impossible to go out for like a casual thing and if people see you--
3:07 3:07 MALE:  What difference does it make?  
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  --they turn it into something--
3:08 3:08 MALE:  What does the real difference that it makes to them? 
3:09 3:20 FEMALE:  It doesn't really make a difference but it makes it hard for a relationship to progress naturally because it's like reality TV, it's like public consumption right, so people are turning it into something that it's not, when it's not necessarily at that stage.  
3:21 3:23 MALE:  You should not give a shit.   
3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  I'm not saying I do.  [laughter] I'm saying that this is in general.  I haven't dated.  
3:28 3:29 MALE:  Why haven't you dated--why haven't you been in a relationship since college?  
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  I haven't been asked.  
3:30 3:33 MALE:  Oh I see.  How long ago was college?  
3:34 3:35 FEMALE:  Long time ago, five years. 
3:36 3:36 MALE:  Wow.  
3:37 3:40 FEMALE:  It's sad isn't it?  Well because I was working in investment banking, and that does not lend itself--
3:41 3:43 MALE:  Why do you feel like you need to be out? Maybe you should just be the master.  
3:44 3:56 FEMALE:  [laughter] That's a good point.  Are you my mother?  Did my mother send you here?  [laughter] Um, no I think I'm a, I'm a little bit more reserved in the whole asking--
           [horn]
3:57 4:06 FEMALE:  --someone out situation.  I mean it's just hard at the business school, because if like the whole, you know, its get escalated in importance right?  
4:07 4:08 MALE:  You're a great test, just do it.  I'm serious.  
4:09 4:13 FEMALE:  [laughter] I'll see you later.
