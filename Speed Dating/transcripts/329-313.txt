0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, this is painful dude.
0:02 0:02 MALE:  All right.
0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:03 0:03 MALE:  I'm male313.
0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  male313?  female329.
0:04 0:04 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  It's nice to meet you.  What do you do?
0:06 0:06 MALE:  I do CS.
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  Oh my gosh.  There's so many people here. 
0:08 0:08 MALE:  Yeah.  I think--
0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  [interposing] Okay.  CS--um like I can't remember anything.
0:11 0:11 MALE:  --guys are a dime a dozen around here.
0:11 0:17 FEMALE:  Well no, no--I--I just mean like--I'm like you're CS and I'm like going all these other people are all these other things, and I'm like I can't remember anything anymore.
0:17 0:18 MALE:  Yeah, I probably should be taking notes.
0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, this is too hard.  It's okay.  My name's female329.  So, sorry.
0:22 0:22 MALE:  Whoa.
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Um yeah.
0:23 0:24 MALE:  Really?  Excellent.
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Excellent.  What's up?  
0:26 0:26 MALE:  How's it going?
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  Good.  How are you?
0:27 0:27 MALE:  Not too bad.
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  I'm tired.
0:29 0:30 MALE:  Yeah, I'm getting a little tired.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  I think there's too much talking.
0:31 0:33 MALE:  Yeah, but you have to right?
0:33 0:34 FEMALE:  I know.  It's painful.
0:33 0:34 MALE:  Awkward silences are worse.
0:35 0:39 FEMALE:  How about if it's not awkward you just [unintelligible] and we sit here for four minutes and say nothing.  How does that sound?
0:40 0:40 MALE:  [laughter].  Can you imagine?
0:41 0:43 FEMALE:  If we both agree to it, would that be considered awkward?
0:44 0:47 MALE:  I think so.  I don't know.  We could try.
0:47 0:51 FEMALE:  It's only awkward if you think it's awkward.  If I don't think it's awkward, I wouldn't find it awkward.  
0:50 0:51 MALE:  Awkward is a--is a state of mind.
0:51 0:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  We can just stare at you for four minutes straight.
0:54 0:56 MALE:  Yeah, we could.  Oh, that would be interesting, sort of staying [unintelligible].
0:57 1:00 FEMALE:  And then we can rate each other on intelligence and everything else based off of our silence.
1:00 1:03 MALE:  Based on--yeah, exactly nothing.  No--no data at all.
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  That's--that's a good idea.  [laughter].
1:03 1:05 MALE:  I mean it's almost the same amount of data as four minutes.
1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  Yes, basically.  It really is.
1:06 1:07 MALE:  Right?  It's like I have no idea.
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  It's irrelevant.  So I mean we might as well do it.
1:09 1:10 MALE:  Interesting.  Wow.
1:11 1:21 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  Sorry, I didn't mean--but then you won't ever remember anything after this conversation.  You won't actually remember anything in this conversation itself, so it's actually irrelevant to talk.  Think about it.
1:21 1:21 MALE:  You know--
1:22 1:25 FEMALE:  [interposing] What's the point of this whole thing if we--you know, we don't remember anything anyways?
1:25 1:26 MALE:  Yeah.  Do we get to keep these things?
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  I don't think so.  They were [unintelligible] which makes it even worse.
1:28 1:30 MALE:  Makes it worse because you said you match with these--
1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  [interposing] You can't remember anything.
1:30 1:31 MALE:  --people, and we're like--
1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  [interposing] I don't even know who they are.
1:32 1:33 MALE:  --put your thoughts are.  No, yeah it is.
1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  Exactly.  There's a problem.  What can we do?
1:36 1:37 MALE:  I don't know.  I mean--
1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  I think we can--
1:37 1:43 MALE:  [interposing] Actually there's some blank pages in here.  I was going to go through and write down my comments on one of these blank pages.
1:44 1:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, I saw the blank pages and I flipped out because that they actually stopped--yeah, those ones.  You can write something on them.  What are you going to write on it?
1:50 1:50 MALE:  I don't know.
1:51 1:54 FEMALE:  Think of something quick.  Be creative.  Brainstorm.  You got to brainstorm now.
1:53 1:53 MALE:  I'll probably go through--
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  [interposing] Brainstorm.
1:53 1:56 MALE:  You know, you have an advantage because you stay in the same place.
1:57 1:57 FEMALE:  I know.
1:57 1:59 MALE:  So I can go through afterward and kind of go okay--
1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  [interposing] I can't.
2:00 2:02 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  You guys are just going to be able--
2:02 2:08 FEMALE:  [interposing] We just are stuck in place 'cause we're lazy and worthless and can only sit--so anyway.
2:08 2:11 MALE:  I don't know.  I've been to like three of these now, and the women always stay put.
2:12 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, why is that?  What if the girls want to move?
2:14 2:15 MALE:  I don't know why.  Maybe the guys should--
2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  [interposing] Next time I should just move.
2:17 2:22 MALE:  That would be awesome.  But then we'd be again together with four minutes of silence between we decided not to talk.  [laughter].
2:22 2:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  We'll just switch places.  Then you'll be the girl and the guy comes and you can talk to other guys.  That would be awesome.
2:28 2:31 MALE:  Well, there was the weird sort of homoerotic vibe for the first date.  I don't know.
2:32 2:32 FEMALE:  There was?
2:32 2:34 MALE:  Yeah, with that same-sex partner.
2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  You did?  Where?
2:35 2:39 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] remember at the beginning of the night?  Were you here for that?
2:39 2:40 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
2:41 2:43 MALE:  That was weird.  It's like I just talked to a guy for a minute.
2:43 2:45 FEMALE:  Would you give him your email for a date?
2:46 2:47 MALE:  So I could put him down?  Hell yeah.  I don't know.
2:47 2:48 FEMALE:  [laughter].
2:48 2:50 MALE:  It's so bizarre.  I'm like not really.
2:51 2:56 FEMALE:  You should be like--actually that was my favorite date of the evening.  I'd give him my email.
2:56 2:56 MALE:  [laughter].
2:57 2:57 FEMALE:  I'd hang out with him again.
2:57 2:59 MALE:  Well, yeah.  Oh my gosh. 
2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  Oh my gosh.
3:00 3:02 MALE:  Maybe I'm looking for the wrong thing here tonight. 
3:02 3:04 FEMALE:  Maybe you just need to get on this side of the chair.
3:05 3:05 MALE:  Maybe so.
3:05 3:08 FEMALE:  Maybe you should take this chair right now, sit right here and the next person comes--
3:08 3:08 MALE:  [interposing] And then just take off and like--
3:08 3:09 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.  Yes, basically.
3:09 3:10 MALE:  Yeah.  Hi, you're dating both of us.
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  [laughter]. 
3:11 3:11 MALE:  Can you imagine?  [laughter].
3:12 3:13 FEMALE:  That would be awesome.
3:14 3:15 MALE:  Are you meeting good guys?
3:15 3:18 FEMALE:  I'm meeting funny guys.  I really am entertaining myself, which is great.
3:18 3:21 MALE:  Yeah.  Well, two hours of entertainment for free is good.
3:21 3:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's pretty good actually.  It's a pretty fun time.  And you?
3:24 3:25 MALE:  I'm meeting lots of good guys.  No.
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  Dude, you definitely need to sit on this side of the table.  [laughter].
3:28 3:33 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  It's been okay.  A little awkward because of this thing that keeps slipping down.
3:34 3:36 FEMALE:  How come you guys all got cooler ones than I do?  
3:36 3:36 MALE:  I think that's cooler actually.  
3:37 3:42 FEMALE:  I seemed to have gotten the gypped [phonetic] one.  No, 'cause look, the gypped one has a huge mic sticking out of it.  You don't even have--yours is like--
3:42 3:42 MALE:  [interposing] It's kind of cool.  It looks like a robot.
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  --internal.
3:44 3:44 MALE:  It's like Short Circuit.
3:44 3:48 FEMALE:  I mean, I guess so but it doesn't look so cool to me.
3:48 3:49 MALE:  I don't know.  At least you can tell that yours is on.
3:49 3:51 FEMALE:  But you know mine is 42 minutes and 33 seconds left.
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Oh, that's cool.
3:54 3:58 FEMALE:  42 minutes and 30 seconds.  And I'm located in holder A.
3:59 3:59 MALE:  All right. 
4:00 4:06 FEMALE:  It is kind of cool though actually I have to admit.  It still looks kind of lame to me.  I still feel like I'm holding a [unintelligible] with a big belt on me.
4:06 4:06 MALE:  It is kind of weird.
4:07 4:09 FEMALE:  It's kind of strange.  I don't know about that.  What's your name again?
4:09 4:09 MALE:  male313.
4:10 4:10 FEMALE:  Okay.  
4:10 4:11 MALE:  All right.  Have fun tonight.
4:11 4:11 FEMALE:  Thanks, you too.
4:12 4:12 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
4:12 4:13 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
4:14 4:14 MALE:  With this guy you can.
4:15 4:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, you know what?  [unintelligible]--
