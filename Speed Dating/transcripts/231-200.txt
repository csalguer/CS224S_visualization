0:13 0:14 MALE: Yeah.  What's [unintelligible]?

0:15 0:21 FEMALE: What's my story?  I'm in the department of communication.  I'm a first year student.  I just moved to California.  You're making notes on me?

0:21 0:22 MALE: Yeah.  Absolutely.

0:22 0:28 FEMALE: Okay.  Um, yeah, I moved to California about six months ago.  Um.

0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Okay.  

0:35 0:36 MALE: [unintelligible].

0:36 0:37 FEMALE: Okay.  A PhD student?

0:38 0:41 MALE: I was going to be, but, you know, [unintelligible] engineer's degree.

0:41 0:42 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:42 0:43 MALE: [unintelligible].

0:44 0:50 FEMALE: I uh, this is my first year, and I don't know if, you know, when you what--when you were a first year were you still thinking PhD?

0:50 0:51 MALE: Yeah.  

0:51 0:55 FEMALE: Possibly?  Yeah.  So it's been kind of a rough year in terms of, like, you know.

0:54 0:56 MALE: Oh so you're still trying to make a decision.

0:56 1:00 FEMALE: Is this really what I want to do, and all those sorts of things.  So I'm back on the upswing.  I think I like it a little bit better now, like, yeah.

1:01 1:04 MALE: The spring semester seems to be an upswing.

1:04 1:08 FEMALE: Yeah.  Winter was a little rough.  And it's funny 'cause it wasn't even, like, weather-wise it wasn't even that bad, right?

1:08 1:09 MALE: [unintelligible].

1:09 1:11 FEMALE: Like it rained some but it's not cold, it's--

1:10 1:12 MALE: It's always [unintelligible] over wintertime, always [unintelligible].

1:11 1:16 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So are you in your second year then, about to be done, or?

1:15 1:16 MALE: No, I'm finished.

1:16 1:17 FEMALE: Oh you're done?

1:17 1:18 MALE: Yeah.  In December I got the thesis signed.

1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Congratulations.

1:19 1:21 MALE: Thank you.  I tell you it's been a load off.

1:21 1:22 FEMALE: I bet.

1:22 1:25 MALE: The sun's come out, [unintelligible], you know, the birds are singing.

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:26 1:28 MALE: It's [unintelligible].

1:28 1:30 FEMALE: So what are you doing now?

1:30 1:34 MALE: Well, let's see, working over physics uh, well actually the experimental physics lab.

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:35 1:41 MALE: You know, and then working on a project trying to detect gravity waves, so we're working on a very sensitive instrument.

1:41 1:42 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:42 1:44 MALE: So I mean part of my thesis [unintelligible] some of that work, so I'm--

1:44 1:45 FEMALE: Cool.

1:45 1:46 MALE: --going to continue [unintelligible].

1:46 1:48 FEMALE: That's very cool.  So do you like it then?

1:48 1:51 MALE: I do.  I like [unintelligible] I don't know why.

1:51 1:52 FEMALE: That's cool.

1:52 1:56 MALE: A little kid, growing up on a farm, didn't know what [unintelligible].

1:55 1:57 FEMALE: Yeah.  So where did you grow up then?

1:58 1:59 MALE: Eastern plains.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Oh.

1:59 2:03 MALE: Kind of flat--well, it's a lot like Kansas before you hit the mountains.

2:03 2:08 FEMALE: Okay.  My family used to spend some parts of the summer in Estes Park.

2:08 2:09 MALE: Oh okay.

2:09 2:11 FEMALE: Just on the edge of the, of the park, and--

2:11 2:16 MALE: Well, we like to think that we're the part of Colorado that makes the mountains look so magnificent, you know.

2:16 2:19 FEMALE: Fair enough.  I grew up in Dallas.  It's all flat there too.

2:19 2:20 MALE: [unintelligible].

2:20 2:21 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:21 2:22 MALE: At least you can see a lot.

2:22 2:24 FEMALE: Yes.  You can.

2:23 2:27 MALE: [unintelligible] the East Coast with all those trees around you.

2:27 2:29 FEMALE: Have you spent time on the East Coast then or--?

2:29 2:30 MALE: Somewhat.  [unintelligible].

2:30 2:31 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:31 2:32 MALE: [unintelligible].

2:31 2:32 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:33 2:34 MALE: So communications.

2:34 2:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:34 2:35 MALE: What's your interest?

2:35 2:45 FEMALE: I, my interest is in political communication.  Our department kind of has two strengths, which are political communication and HCI, human-computer interaction.  

2:45 2:46 MALE: Oh, thank you.

2:46 2:55 FEMALE: Yeah.  So sort of two seemingly pretty disparate areas, um and I'm in the poli com side of things, so, and my particular interest is how young people can be engaged to be active in politics.

2:56 2:57 MALE: Very nice.

2:57 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah.  So I, and I lived in DC before coming here, so I spent some time doing politics--like stuff, you know.

3:04 3:05 MALE: Do you enjoy it?

3:05 3:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  I--

3:05 3:06 MALE: [unintelligible]?

3:06 3:12 FEMALE: It was--um, DC's sort of interesting.  People move around real fast, kind of for the sake of moving around real fast.  

3:12 3:13 MALE:  [unintelligible].

3:13 3:14 FEMALE: If that makes sense, like, they don't really know how to take a break.

3:15 3:16 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:17 3:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  Whereas people here I feel like are really good about, like, committing to what they're doing and being good at it, but when they want to go play volleyball they just--they go play volleyball, you know?  Yeah.  

3:28 3:31 MALE: If the weather's nice outside [unintelligible].

3:29 3:32 FEMALE: Right.  Right.  Which, which I appreciate a great deal.

3:33 3:35 MALE: Yeah.  I couldn't handle going to a school on the east coast.

3:35 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:36 3:38 MALE: All that tension and winding up the spring you know.

3:39 3:40 FEMALE: Did you do undergrad here as well, or--?

3:40 3:41 MALE: The only thing--well, I did in Colorado.

3:41 3:42 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:41 3:42 MALE: University of Colorado.

3:42 3:43 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:43 3:44 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:44 3:45 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:45 3:47 MALE: Had a good chance to come out here, so I thought well--

3:48 4:01 FEMALE: Yeah.  It is beautiful.  I was looking--when I was looking at graduate schools I was looking here and then you know, a place in Chicago and a place in Philadelphia, and it's just--I mean, I had friends who were like, are you kidding me?  [laughter] How can you possibly not go to Stanford.  [horn] 

4:02 4:03 MALE: [unintelligible].

4:03 4:06 FEMALE: That was quick.  It was nice meeting you too, absolutely.
