0:01 0:02 MALE: Oh did they start now?

0:02 0:03 FEMALE: [unintelligible]

0:03 0:04 MALE: Okay.  

0:04 0:06 FEMALE: [unintelligible] not on time.  [laughter] [horn] 

0:07 0:10 MALE: Oh okay, there's the, there's the start.  So your name's female231?  Or nameX?

0:09 0:12 FEMALE: I'm nameX.  Yeah.  Most people call me nameX.

0:12 0:13 MALE: Okay.  Okay.  So uh I'm male209.

0:13 0:14 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

0:14 0:18 MALE: And uh can we--well let's make it a little more interesting, I'll guess.

0:16 0:17 FEMALE: Okay.  

0:19 0:20 MALE: I'll guess your uh department.

0:18 0:20 FEMALE: Oh that'll be fun.  Okay.

0:21 0:23 MALE: Okay.  You are in education.

0:21 0:22 FEMALE: I'm not.

0:23 0:24 MALE: Lawyer?

0:22 0:25 FEMALE: No.  I'll take that as a compliment, even though I'm not sure it is.

0:26 0:30 MALE: [unintelligible] you're in the business school.  No?

0:28 0:29 FEMALE: No.

0:31 0:33 MALE: Okay.  One more guess, I will say math.

0:31 0:33 FEMALE: No, but my mother would be happy with that one.

0:35 0:36 MALE: Okay, okay.  I give up.

0:33 0:35 FEMALE: Should I tell you or should I just start guessing?

0:37 0:38 MALE: Yeah tell me, otherwise [unintelligible].

0:35 0:37 FEMALE: I'm in the department of communication.

0:39 0:40 MALE: Oh okay.

0:37 0:40 FEMALE: And we're very small, so it makes sense that you wouldn't actually guess that.

0:42 0:44 MALE: Oh okay.  I would never have guessed that.

0:42 0:43 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:45 0:47 MALE: Okay not--I mean not--I just don't know anything about communication.

0:45 0:47 FEMALE: Does this mean I have to guess which department you're in then?

0:49 0:50 MALE: No, I'll just tell you.  I'm in geophysics.

0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Oh really?

0:51 0:52 MALE: Yeah.  

0:49 0:50 FEMALE: Huh.

0:52 0:53 MALE: 'Cause it would take forever.  It would be impossible.

0:51 0:52 FEMALE: Yeah I wouldn't have gotten there.

0:54 0:59 MALE: So uh I'll--I can guess from your accent where you're from.  That'll be the next game we--

0:57 0:58 FEMALE: Okay.  Can you?

1:00 1:01 MALE: No.

0:59 1:00 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:02 1:03 MALE: Uh I would say Ohio.

1:00 1:01 FEMALE: No.

1:03 1:04 MALE: Okay, where?

1:02 1:04 FEMALE: I'm from Texas.  And I actually--

1:05 1:07 MALE: I never would've guessed that.

1:05 1:07 FEMALE: Yeah.  And I get a lot of you don't sound like you're from Texas.

1:09 1:10 MALE: Yeah.

1:07 1:08 FEMALE: Where are you from?

1:10 1:11 MALE: Connecticut.

1:09 1:10 FEMALE: Oh really?

1:12 1:13 MALE: Are you from Austin perhaps?

1:11 1:15 FEMALE: No, but I went to school in Austin.  I grew up in Dallas but I lived in Austin for about eight years, so.

1:17 1:18 MALE: Oh okay.  UT at Austin?

1:15 1:16 FEMALE: I can--yeah.  

1:18 1:20 MALE:  That's nice, nice.

1:16 1:21 FEMALE: I definitely consider Austin--if I were to go back to Texas it would be Austin.

1:23 1:25 MALE: I lived in Austin for about eight months myself.

1:23 1:24 FEMALE: Oh where?

1:26 1:28 MALE: [unintelligible] south. 

1:28 1:29 FEMALE: For fun, for--?

1:30 1:39 MALE: You know, the--all I can tell you is uh there was like, Bee Caves Road, but I don't think I lived on Bee Caves Road.  You know, just to the south.

1:37 1:38 FEMALE: [unintelligible] yeah.

1:40 1:41 MALE: The south side, and.

1:39 1:40 FEMALE: What were you doing in Austin?

1:42 1:48 MALE: Just living after college.  This was about, uh, you know, ten, ten--ish years ago, and like--

1:45 1:46 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:48 1:49 MALE: Undergrad and uh.

1:47 1:48 FEMALE: Where'd you go to undergrad then?

1:50 1:52 MALE: Uh Temple in Philadelphia.

1:50 1:51 FEMALE: Oh okay.

1:53 1:54 MALE: Yeah.  

1:52 1:55 FEMALE: I've spent--I actually, I dated a guy who lived in Philadelphia, so I spent a fair amount of time in Philly.

1:57 1:58 MALE: Oh okay.

1:56 1:57 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:58 1:59 MALE: Well what do you think of Philly?

1:57 1:58 FEMALE: I like it a lot.

2:00 2:01 MALE: Do you?

1:59 2:00 FEMALE: Are you a nameX's or a Gino's guy then?

2:02 2:03 MALE: Excuse me?

2:01 2:03 FEMALE: Are you a nameX's or a Gino's guy, or other?

2:05 2:07 MALE: What is that, I don't even know [laughter].

2:05 2:09 FEMALE: For uh cheesesteaks.  Because there's always a thing that--maybe it was just the group of people I knew from Philadelphia who were very big on--

2:11 2:12 MALE: Well I only spent, like, four years there, but um--

2:10 2:11 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:13 2:15 MALE:  I guess I'm clueless but, you know, whatever.

2:13 2:14 FEMALE: No, it's fine.

2:15 2:17 MALE: Yeah.  I know cheesesteaks, you know.

2:15 2:19 FEMALE: Yeah.  Austin's a fun city.  I enjoy it a lot.

2:21 2:24 MALE: Yeah.  I do, I do like Austin a lot.  I, I would go back there.  It's hell on the allergies though.

2:22 2:23 FEMALE: Yes.

2:25 2:26 MALE: Mine in particular.

2:24 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah.  That's true.  It's funny, this is actually my first year in California, and we got to--we got to kind of March first and I, like, it never got cold, the whole time--

2:34 2:35 MALE: Oh yeah.

2:33 2:34 FEMALE: Over the winter, so.

2:36 2:37 MALE: Right.  

2:35 2:37 FEMALE: I think this might be okay.  This might be a good place to stay.

2:38 2:44 MALE: Yeah.  So you just started at um, um, uh communications PhD.

2:42 2:43 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.  Yep.

2:45 2:46 MALE: Pre-proposal?

2:44 2:46 FEMALE: Pre-proposal [laughter] I'm not quite there yet.  

2:48 2:49 MALE: Oh okay.

2:47 2:52 FEMALE: But I think probably my dissertation will be something on uh, youth political engagement in new media.

2:54 2:56 MALE: Oh okay.  Cool.

2:53 2:57 FEMALE: Something in there.  It's what I did my master's thesis on, so I'll probably just go kind of a step further with it.

2:59 3:01 MALE: Wow.  Cool.  So--

2:59 3:04 FEMALE: So it's a pretty good department.  I'm, you know, we're kind of divided into political communication and HCI.

3:06 3:07 MALE: Right.  

3:04 3:06 FEMALE: And I'm on the poli com side of things.

3:07 3:09 MALE: Okay.  Cool.

3:07 3:08 FEMALE: So.

3:09 3:16 MALE: And then uh you, so you'll be um, uh have you been exploring the area, going to the city, all this stuff?  Monterey?

3:13 3:17 FEMALE: A little bit.  I've got some friends who live up there.  I haven't actually been down to Monterey yet.

3:19 3:20 MALE: Oh you should check it out, it's pretty cool.

3:18 3:19 FEMALE: Yeah?  How long've you been here?

3:22 3:25 MALE: Uh, on and off, uh, six-ish, seven-ish, eight-ish years or something, I don't know.

3:23 3:24 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:26 3:29 MALE: I mean, I got my master's, then I left and came back and--

3:27 3:28 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:30 3:33 MALE: So, so a few years, yeah.  I think--

3:30 3:33 FEMALE: Do you--I guess you like it then or--?

3:35 3:40 MALE: I do.  I like it a lot.  It takes getting used to, I don't know.  You know, how do you like it?

3:39 3:41 FEMALE: I like the area.  I'm having a hard time--

3:43 3:44 MALE: Culturally?

3:41 3:43 FEMALE: --whether or not I like doing a PhD.

3:46 3:48 MALE: Oh just Stanford.  There's a lot of--

3:46 3:49 FEMALE: But, you know, I think everybody in their first year sort of questions whether or not--

3:51 3:55 MALE: The six month blues.  But of course uh, it's a little past that, I guess, or whatever.

3:53 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah, well I'm on the upswing too.

3:57 3:58 MALE: Oh okay, good.

3:56 3:57 FEMALE: So at least I feel like I'm on the upswing a little bit.

3:59 4:02 MALE: Yeah.  Well I definitely uh, I go through that every now and then still, so.

4:00 4:01 FEMALE: Right.  

4:03 4:06 MALE: You know, periods of--well, right now I just want to get out of here, that's true.

4:04 4:07 FEMALE: Are you, are you working on your dissertation now then or--? [horn] 

4:09 4:11 MALE: Well I should be.  [laughter] 

4:09 4:12 FEMALE: Do you live on campus or do you live up in the city or--?

4:14 4:15 MALE: No, I live in Cupertino.

4:13 4:14 FEMALE: Okay.  

4:16 4:19 MALE: Yeah.  So we move and then fill it out?  Okay.  

4:16 4:17 FEMALE: Yeah, I think you move.
