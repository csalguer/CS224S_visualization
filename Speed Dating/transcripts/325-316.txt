0:02:42.2 0:03:01.2 MALE:  [laughter] that's actually- yeah, that's pretty accurate.  Except I take a class on more than just decision sciences, but- but everything is relatively accurate.  No.  I do a little bit more.  Yeah, we do [unintelligible].  One of the guys actually that you'll be meeting in a few minutes I think is- he's actually [unintelligible], so definitely is going to be fulfilling that stereotype.

0:03:15.7 0:03:19.3 MALE:  No, no, we do.  But I mean in terms of like when people come through and say oh, this is what I do.
0:03:41.3 0:03:45.4 FEMALE:  Well certainly if somebody says I'm a solar physicist, they really do know what they're saying.
