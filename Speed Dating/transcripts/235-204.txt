0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

0:05 0:05 MALE:  All right.  

0:05 0:07 FEMALE:  You think that there's so many times that you can get [unintelligible].  

0:07 0:08 MALE:  [laughter] that's right.  

0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  But --  

0:08 0:12 MALE:  But the problem is that I'm still trying to be serious about doing this.  

0:12 0:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, I fluctuate, yeah.  

0:14 0:20 MALE:  [laughter] someone is going to get to the end of these things and they're just going to find smiley faces drawn in.  

0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  Or just like a line through each column.  

0:21 0:25 MALE:  [laughter] so my name is male204.  

0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  Hi I'm female235.  

0:27 0:27 MALE:  female235, nice to meet you.  

0:27 0:30 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  So you're an male204 G. I think there's another male204?  

0:31 0:31 MALE:  Have you met him yet?  

0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  I think so.  

0:32 0:33 MALE:  Oh okay.  

0:33 0:33 FEMALE:  It's okay.  

0:33 0:41 MALE:  Up until this point I haven't run into the people who had met the other male204 yet, so it's always like the -- oh there's another male204.  

0:41 0:46 FEMALE:  I think so, I could be actually making this up. I am pretty like -- poor, everyone is the same.  

0:46 0:51 MALE:  I know -- well okay I can still flip through the names and remember people.  

0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Yeah so far.  

0:52 0:53 MALE:  So far, so far.    

0:53 0:55 FEMALE:  Ask me in one hour, maybe not.  

0:55 0:59 MALE:  [laughter] that's right, so it's a memory task.  So what's your major?  

1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  I'm in the School of Education.  

1:02 1:02 MALE:  School of Education.  

1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  A Masters student.  

1:04 1:04 MALE:  Okay.  

1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Okay you've met --  

1:07 1:11 MALE:  I've met a couple.  I've met a couple, so -- all right my mother's a teacher.  

1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  Oh okay, so is mine.  

1:14 1:20 MALE:  Okay, well she's a special ed, she's actually a special ed chair now at her intermediate school that she teaches at --  

1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Okay.  

1:21 1:23 MALE:  But she was always, always been a special ed teacher --  

1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Okay.  

1:23 1:35 MALE:  -- for as long as I can remember.  So, special ed teachers do a lot of the whole, the whole intelligence testing and the whole like, I don't know, there's a technical name for it that I can't remember, but -  

1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  Okay.  

1:35 1:50 MALE:  -- but speaking of like the whole memory and trying to remember people's names, I just remember, because in order to give these tests, the teachers that give them have to be qualified, they have to go through and they have give all these practice tests and everything like that and so, we used to be guinea pigs, me and my brother.  

1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  [laughter] oh great.  

1:52 1:53 MALE:  And they have like these --  

1:53 1:55 FEMALE:  So you're really good at them now?  

1:55 2:09 MALE:  I'm not so sure, they have these like little binder flip things and they'd show the binder and there'd be like this little squiggle that's drawn on there and then it -- this is blurt, say how to blurt, hi blurt.  This is [unintelligible], say hi to [unintelligible].  

2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  That's hard to say. [laughter]   

2:10 2:22 MALE:  [laughter] Yeah it's hard to say, which one is blurt, that's blurt.  All right, then they go on and on and on to the point where it's just coming up like 40 different cartoon characters to choose from and they're like which one is blurt and you're like --  

2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  I don't know.  

2:24 2:24 MALE:  I don't know.  

2:25 2:27 FEMALE:  That's so funny.  So you're --  

2:27 2:28 MALE:  So I've been a guinea pig.  

2:29 2:33 FEMALE:  So your experience actually -- so I'm having flashbacks right now.  

2:34 2:37 MALE:  No mom, I don't remember who blurt is. [laughter]   

2:38 2:41 FEMALE:  Did you ever make up your own test too now, are you like, so  

2:42 2:42 MALE:  So that's right.  

2:43 2:43 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  

2:43 2:48 MALE:  Actually I should sneak it back into the order and like come sit down to a date that I've already been --  

2:48 2:49 FEMALE:  And you're like, so do you remember my name?  

2:49 2:56 MALE:  Do you remember, what's my name?  All right, pretend I didn't go there.  [laughter]  

2:57 2:58 FEMALE:  So, what department are you in?  

2:59 2:59 MALE:  I'm in electrical engineering.  

3:00 3:04 FEMALE:  Oh EE, okay so do you know the other EE people here, well it's a pretty huge department right?  

3:04 3:06 MALE:  Yeah there are, there other EEs here?  

3:06 3:09 FEMALE:  I have met a couple, like just, you don't know, but --  

3:09 3:11 MALE:  nameX is EE.  

3:12 3:13 FEMALE:  I know nameX.  

3:13 3:15 MALE:  [laughter] I think everyone knows nameX.  

3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Everyone seems to know nameX.  

3:16 3:19 MALE:  [laughter] He's one of those guys.  

3:19 3:21 FEMALE:  I thought I'd see him today, I had this feeling I would see him.  

3:22 3:28 MALE:  [laughter] I didn't.  When he showed up I was like, you know, that makes sense.  

3:28 3:31 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] [laughter] oh yes.  

3:31 3:37 MALE:  You know, in engineering we need as many people like nameX around as we can find.  

3:38 3:38 FEMALE:  And why is that?  

3:39 3:40 MALE:  Because, well, of engineers.  

3:41 3:46 FEMALE:  Right.  I mean, I've heard there are [unintelligible] I just wanted to hear it like from actual EE.  

3:47 3:47 MALE:  Oh.  

3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  Why is that, you know.  

3:49 3:49 MALE:  You should come watch.  

3:50 3:52 FEMALE:  Watch what?  [laughter] 

3:51 3:53 MALE:  [laughter]  

3:53 3:55 FEMALE:  Interactions with the EEs?  

3:54 4:00 MALE:  That's right they're beyond the grunting and pointing phase, but not very far.  

4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  [laughter]  

4:01 4:02 MALE:  All right, well it was nice meeting you.  

4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you [laughter].
