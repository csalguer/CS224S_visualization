0:21 0:21 FEMALE: Good.  
0:21 0:22 MALE: Interesting experience.
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: You having fun?
0:23 0:29 MALE: Sure.  I've had such a busy week, that I was like, "Oh, do I cancel or should I just come" and then I felt like--
0:30 0:33 FEMALE: And then suddenly you feel really busy again, because you have like four minutes to hear something.
0:33 0:36 MALE: Right, and [unintelligible] What are you doing here?  
0:37 0:38 FEMALE: Uh, I'm uh--
0:38 0:39 MALE: Not at speed dating, but--
0:39 0:40 FEMALE: [laughter] What am I doing here?  
0:40 0:41 MALE: What are you doing here? 
0:41 0:48 FEMALE: Why did I come here?  No, um, I'm in the biology department, in a Ph.D. program.  What about you?
0:48 0:50 MALE: I'm in the business school.
0:50 0:50 FEMALE: Okay.
0:51 0:55 MALE: I have three more weeks of freedom, and then back to the real world.
0:56 0:57 FEMALE: So are- are you graduating?
0:57 0:57 MALE: Yes, I am.
0:57 0:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  Where are you headed?
0:59 1:03 MALE: Uh, I'm actually going to be around here.  Um, I'm trying to start a business.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE: Cool.
1:05 1:07 MALE: It's fun and scary and exciting.
1:08 1:10 FEMALE: Yeah, what's- what's it-- what does it do?
1:10 1:13 MALE: Um, it doe-- it helps people to be healthier.
1:14 1:14 FEMALE: Okay.
1:14 1:18 MALE: Basically.  Uh, we're trying to sell it to a company.  We don't, I haven't actually done anything yet, so--
1:18 1:18 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
1:18 1:19 MALE: It's just an idea, but--
1:19 1:19 FEMALE: Sure.
1:19 1:31 MALE: The idea is to create behavioral change interventions in like nutrition and fitness, etc., that try to improve the health risk profile of companies.  
1:31 1:32 FEMALE: Of companies.
1:31 1:35 MALE: You know, by reduce their healthcare costs.  Well, individuals within companies.
1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Okay.
1:36 1:40 MALE: But we think that the employers would be willing to pay for it 'cause they end up paying for the healthcare costs.
1:40 1:43 FEMALE: I see, so- so for companies that act as insurers, that are--
1:44 1:44 MALE: Right, exactly.
1:44 1:44 FEMALE: Okay.
1:45 1:45 MALE: Exactly.
1:46 1:46 FEMALE: I see.
1:46 1:53 MALE: Um, and there's a lot of studies being done now showing how a) preventive care works and b) that it saves money in the long run because of reduced--
1:52 1:53 FEMALE: Yeah, totally.
1:53 1:55 MALE: --treatments are more expensive than prevention.
1:56 1:56 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
1:56 1:57 MALE: An ounce of prevention, right?  
1:57 1:57 FEMALE: [laughter]
1:57 1:59 MALE: Um, so we'll see, it's exciting.  
2:00 2:00 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
2:01 2:02 MALE: Cool mission to be pursuing.
2:03 2:03 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:04 2:15 MALE: I have no experience in healthcare and now I'm just-- it's one of those things where you're just like, "Well, I'm smart enough, I'm sure I'll figure it out along the way," and then everyone's telling me, "You're crazy," and you shouldn't do it, and that kind of fuels you and stuff.
2:15 2:15 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
2:16 2:16 MALE: Where's your [unintelligible]
2:16 2:22 FEMALE: So how do you- how do you push something like that?  Like- Like you just have a program within the company, to get people?
2:22 2:22 MALE: How do you sell it?
2:23 2:23 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:23 2:24 MALE: Or how do you get people to use it?
2:25 2:29 FEMALE: Well, how do you actually do it in the company?  Like get people to- to use this program, or-- ?
2:30 2:38 MALE: Um, the idea would be, a) like well first so you sell it to the employer, and then they-- these-- first they just have to offer it to the employees. Many will probably want to do it.
2:39 2:39 FEMALE: Right.
2:39 2:43 MALE: And you can incentivize them to start it, to take the assessment test, things like that.  Give them--
2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Okay.
2:43 2:45 MALE: Twenty bucks or you know--
2:46 2:46 FEMALE: Right.
2:46 2:50 MALE: Gold star or whatever, you know, you just incentivize them somehow, and they come-- 
2:50 2:52 FEMALE: Or a donut.  Yeah [laughter]
2:51 3:01 MALE: We'll give you a donut, whatever works.  And then they get interested in the results and they're like, "Oh, you know what, you're right, I do need to, you know, lose a couple pounds, or I should quit smoking.  Okay, help me."  
3:01 3:02 FEMALE: Okay.
3:03 3:05 MALE: The idea, it's the hope anyway.
3:05 3:05 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
3:06 3:08 MALE: So what are you studying in biology?  You have a [unintelligible]
3:08 3:12 FEMALE: Uh, I study plant biology.  Um, the- the response of plants to global environmental change.
3:13 3:15 MALE: Oh, interesting, hot topic, I imagine.
3:16 3:20 FEMALE: It's popular these days, yeah, um, which is good for me, so--
3:20 3:21 MALE: There's a lot of global environmental change.
3:21 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
3:22 3:24 MALE: That's cool.  How long have you been in the program?
3:24 3:25 FEMALE: I've been here for two years.
3:25 3:27 MALE: Yeah, so another two or-- ?
3:28 3:29 FEMALE: Three probably.
3:29 3:29 MALE: Three more.  
3:29 3:29 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:30 3:32 MALE: And then, you going to go save the world?  
3:33 3:40 FEMALE: If I can [laughter]  Yeah, I don't know, sometimes the world doesn't seem like it's that excited about being saved, right.
3:41 3:43 MALE: That's sadly, I think it's probably true.  
3:44 3:46 FEMALE: I mean, as someone who's trying to save the world from being fat.
3:45 3:49 MALE: Exactly!  People are way too short term focused.  
3:49 3:50 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
3:50 3:54 MALE: Um, that's- that's a tough one.  So you've been having fun at Stanford?  
3:54 4:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's a- it's a really good place to be.  Yeah, and my department's really awesome.  
3:56 4:00 MALE: Yeah, I think so, too.  You live on campus?  
4:01 4:03 FEMALE: I live in Mountain View.  [horn]  That's why.  
4:04 4:05 MALE: Oh, wow.  That's quick.
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: Yes.
4:08 4:10 MALE: So, they want us to rotate and and then fill this out?
4:10 4:12 FEMALE: Yeah, I think they want you to move and then fill out the--
4:11 4:12 MALE: Alright, nice to meet you.
4:12 4:13 FEMALE: Good to meet you.
