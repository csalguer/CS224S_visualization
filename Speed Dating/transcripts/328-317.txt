0:44 0:44 FEMALE:  Harvard '99.
0:41 0:45 MALE:  '99.  Then I beat you.  I got out first.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, good for you.
0:47 0:47 MALE:  There you go.
0:52 0:53 FEMALE:  Awesome.  So what are you studying here?
0:50 0:52 MALE:  So I'm studying electrical engineering and computer architecture.
0:56 0:59 FEMALE:  Oh interesting.  What--what particular area?
0:56 0:58 MALE:  Um it's multiprocessors--
1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
0:58 0:59 MALE:  --and programming for them.
1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  Cool.
1:00 1:02 MALE:  Yeah.  I--what are you--what are you studying?
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Um I'm getting my MBA.
1:04 1:04 MALE:  Okay.
1:08 1:12 FEMALE:  Um but I'm--I'm suddenly very attuned to electrical engineering because--
1:08 1:08 MALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
1:13 1:17 FEMALE:  --I'm working with this um uh consumer robotics startup.
1:13 1:13 MALE:  Okay.
1:18 1:21 FEMALE:  And we've been talking to a lot of electrical engineers lately.
1:17 1:18 MALE:  Oh really.  Okay.  So you're--
1:22 1:24 FEMALE:  [interposing] That's kind of why my head is in outer space.
1:20 1:21 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
1:25 1:27 FEMALE:  So apologies.  Um I can shy away from the shop talk if you want.
1:24 1:25 MALE:  No, no, no.  No, that's great.  That's great.  So--
1:30 1:34 FEMALE:  [interposing] And I was just back in Boston actually for um last weekend through yesterday.  
1:30 1:30 MALE:  Okay.
1:35 1:41 FEMALE:  Uh there was a robotics conference, and also one of my--one of my best friends from school, she um--she had her birthday, so I went up there--
1:37 1:37 MALE:  [interposing] Oh really.
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  --and hung out.
1:38 1:38 MALE:  Cool.  Okay.
1:43 1:53 FEMALE:  Went clubbing, went to--went to Manray [phonetic] on Saturday, danced with all of the--the gay boys and the boys dressed in skirts, which was quite surprising.
1:48 1:50 MALE:  [laughter].  Did you really?  Okay.
1:55 1:56 FEMALE:  No, we danced with each other.  And there were lots of other people there.
1:52 1:53 MALE:  What did you wear?  What did you wear?
1:58 2:02 FEMALE:  I--it was so cold.  I--if I could have--
1:58 1:58 MALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
2:02 2:10 FEMALE:  --I would have worn, you know, a skirt, heels, like some cute tight--tight little fitted top, but it was Boston in May.
2:07 2:07 MALE:  Oh yeah, yeah.
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  And it was 40 freaking degrees.
2:09 2:12 MALE:  I know.  There's nothing pleasant about Boston now is there?
2:16 2:21 FEMALE:  I know.  So I had to wear--I mean, I wore cute jeans but still, they were jeans.  
2:18 2:18 MALE:  Uh-huh.
2:22 2:26 FEMALE:  And I, you know, I was like all bundled up, but I managed to, you know, wear kind of a cute top, but.
2:23 2:23 MALE:  Uh-huh.
2:28 2:31 FEMALE:  Boston is not a good place to be flirty.  It's impossible with that weather.
2:27 2:31 MALE:  Well no, but it is cold and, you know, people want to warm, you know.
2:35 2:38 FEMALE:  Yes, but you have to figure out how to get to a place where you can be flirty without dying.
2:35 2:39 MALE:  That's right.  That's right.  And in the summer, it's too hot.  In the winter, it's too cold.
2:42 2:44 FEMALE:  Exactly.  Well, I think--
2:40 2:40 MALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
2:45 2:52 FEMALE:  I think that's why there are very delimited meeting periods.  So there's a short window in the spring, a short window in the fall where you can wear cute things.
2:49 2:54 MALE:  That explains the mating season, right.  [laughter].  It's the only time you can go out and not, you know, roast or freeze.
2:58 3:06 FEMALE:  But--but even so, it's May and like--there's just--there--there's going to be no hooking up in Boston this year, because they've missed their window.  There's--they're--they're stuck.
3:03 3:06 MALE:  Yeah, that's right.  [laughter].  That's all right.  They're growing too large anyways.
3:10 3:18 FEMALE:  But they still manage.  They'll manage.  There--there will be a new influx of people.  I--or their standards will just decline and people will just have to learn to hit on folks who are wearing snow boots and uh--
3:15 3:15 MALE:  [interposing] That's right.
3:19 3:19 FEMALE:  --and pants.
3:16 3:16 MALE:  [laughter]. 
3:22 3:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, but--yeah.  I'm so glad to be doing grad school out here.
3:23 3:24 MALE:  That's cool.  So this is your first year here?
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Second year, and I'm--
3:26 3:26 MALE:  [interposing] Second year.
3:30 3:31 FEMALE:  --going to stay out here, so.
3:28 3:30 MALE:  Well that is definitely the place to be, right, right here.
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  I think so.
3:31 3:34 MALE:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Between Harvard and Stanford, Stanford definitely won.
3:38 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No question.  The weather's warmer.  People are friendlier.
3:40 3:40 MALE:  That too.
3:44 3:45 FEMALE:  The clothes are better.
3:42 3:44 MALE:  That's right.  [laughter].
3:48 3:56 FEMALE:  And there's just more to do I think.  I don't know.  Maybe--maybe it's just the difference between who I was, like nose in book as an undergrad and--
3:52 3:56 MALE:  [interposing] Uh part of the MBA degree where it's all about networking, right--
4:01 4:01 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh, come on.
3:57 3:58 MALE:  --and meeting people.
4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  It's not--
3:58 3:58 MALE:  [laughter].
4:03 4:05 FEMALE:  And what about EE?  What do you do for fun?
4:02 4:05 MALE:  We put our noses in books [laughter] and computers, right.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  And you get out occasionally at things.
4:07 4:09 MALE:  Well [unintelligible] so.  Well nice meeting you.
4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  Very nice to have met you male317.
