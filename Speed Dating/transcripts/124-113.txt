3:42 3:51 MALE:  [unintelligible] at all.  And like, everywhere you look, there's another company that you hear about in the news all the time.  It was really exciting when I first got here.  And then, like, everything went down hill.

4:27 4:27 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
4:34 4:40 MALE:  Is it kind of different, like, the teaching a high school student versus teaching someone--you have to like be a different kind of person?
4:36 4:42 FEMALE:  Oh definitely.  I mean, like with my kindergarteners, I just try to keep them from getting paint all over their face.  And like--
4:47 4:48 MALE:  Oh okay.  Yeah.

5:30 5:30 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
5:27 5:31 FEMALE:  Um, but, yeah. In several different [unintelligible].
5:36 5:52 MALE:  Yeah.  It--okay, so when I was in high school, I taught like--I was the assistant teacher for like the summer school.  And they were like eight to ten years old.  And like, they were just out of control, and like, I didn't know what to do.  I was maybe, like, 15 at the time.
5:48 5:48 FEMALE:  Oh.
5:53 5:59 MALE:  And then, it just made me really mad, so I'm like, okay.  Everyone's doing sit ups now.  And then I had the whole class do sit ups.  And I was like--
5:55 5:55 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
6:00 6:05 MALE:  Yep.  It was like, they learn all kinds of like math and English, and stuff.  But--

6:05 6:05 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]--
6:11 6:11 MALE:  They were just out of control.
6:08 6:08 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
6:13 6:13 MALE:  They did it.
6:08 6:09 FEMALE:  Really?
6:15 6:23 MALE:  But it was actually, um, well it was kind of weird, 'cause it was also run joint with like a martial arts school.  So maybe that was part of it.
6:20 6:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.
6:27 6:27 MALE:  So.
6:22 6:25 FEMALE:  So what do you think you're going to do after [unintelligible]?
