00:10  00:14	FEMALE:  It's a Hebrew name.
00:15  00:17	MALE: Okay, are you from Israel or you from the states?
00:18  00:23	FEMALE:  No, no.  It's an Israeli name, but my parents just liked it.  So, my sister is nameX and my brother is nameX.  There's no --
00:24  00:25	MALE:  You got -- you got the Hebrew name.
00:25  00:31	FEMALE:  I get the I don't know, so [laughter].  Lucky first born or whatever.
00:32  00:32	MALE:  Yeah.  
00:33  00:35	FEMALE:  So what do you do around here?
00:36  00:37	MALE:  Um, I'm doing engineering.
00:37  00:38	FEMALE:  Okay, what kind of --
00:39  00:51	MALE:  I'm doing a program in electrical engineering,, but what I want to do afterwards is make medical devices like biotech type stuff and so that's my plan.  I'm going to internship over the summer, so I'm like [unintelligible] right now.
00:52  00:52	FEMALE:  Nice
00:53  00:53	MALE:  How about you?
00:53  00:54	FEMALE:  I study education.
00:54  00:56	MALE:  Right on.  So you're obligated to be here.
00:57  01:04	FEMALE:  I don't know, that would be pushing it [laughter].  I'm not sure how this study connects education.
01:05  01:08	MALE:  Do you have a School of Ed people that are here like actually have significant others and they are just told to be here?
01:09  01:16	FEMALE:  Half of them?  I don't know.  I know that some of them do.  But, I don't know all of them [laughter].
01:17  01:35	MALE:  Um, I heard that they did a speed dating in Raines or Ryman or something like that and of course it's like graduate schools so there was trouble getting girls.  So what do they do?   I think the girl who was running it got all her female friends who are dating people to do it.  So like most of the girls that were there actually were just like faking it.
01:36  01:36	FEMALE:  Oh, that's terrible.  
01:37  01:37	MALE:  Yeah it is.
01:38  01:40	FEMALE:  Especially like, not, like I mean when it's not set up --
01:41  01:45	MALE:  Because I mean some people are probably pretty shy to come out to something like this.  And like it's like, you know.
01:46  01:47	FEMALE:  Yeah, so it would be well actually.
01:47  01:54	MALE:  Well, actually you know you like told this person that maybe you like them and then you got trashed because they have somebody already.
01:55  01:57	FEMALE:  Yeah, it was all fake [laughter].  Yeah
01:58  01:59	MALE:   That's crap right there --
02:00  02:06	FEMALE:  Yeah, no, I think we probably got more emails about this than like other people on campus.  But, I don't know if there were any real like [unintelligible].
02:07  02:10	MALE:  So it wasn't like you guys you have to come and do speed dating it's required or nothing like that. 
02:11  02:45	FEMALE:  Yeah, no there was none of that.  I think we just got like the emails like they probably sent it to like the engineering school and cc'd it to us.  So it was like we flash in front of their eyes enough times they'll finally respond kind of thing.  So, you know we hear about it, but.  And then you get the other -- you get the like quarter people of the school who are like grumbling about whether it's like really worthy some head school like attention.  Like you have a [unintelligible] sociology professor of the school of education.  So there's like people who are like --
02:46  02:46	MALE:  People like [unintelligible].
02:46  02:54	FEMALE:  Oh, it's not like that, but people being like I don't know.  We're suppose to be studying education here, like what you know [laughter].  People get obviously --
02:55  02:56	MALE:  Research, everything is like cross disciplinarian.
02:56  03:00	FEMALE:  Everybody can research what they want.  But I definitely heard some people think like I don't know what --
03:01  03:02	MALE:  Keep in mind that he's going to listen to every word we're saying right now.
03:02  03:03	FEMALE:  I know, I know.  But, you know --
03:04  03:04	MALE:  Hi nameX.
03:05  03:10	FEMALE:  How's it going?  Right [laughter].  You know if he cares, we'll worry about that later.
03:11  03:12	MALE:  Sure, maybe he's not a sensitive guy, I don't know.
03:12  03:18	FEMALE:  I'm sure he's heard crap for it.  But yeah, so have you been out in California a while or?
03:19  03:26	MALE:  Yeah I have.  This is my fourth year of school.  So, yeah I like California a lot, I think I'll stay in California.  What about you?
