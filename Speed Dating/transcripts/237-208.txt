00:18  01:01	FEMALE:  What am I passionate about?  That's a really good question.  Um, well, like my roommate would say when I'm trying to procrastinate is that I pay way too much attention to gymnastics.  Like I was a gymnast back in the day.  So I know way too much about [laughter] about gymnastics.  But what I am -- but in terms of being passionate about something, wow, this sounds really dumb, like I know I have interests but it's [laughter] like not that phrasing.  It's like I don't know.

03:46  03:47	FEMALE:  Anywhere and everywhere?
03:47  04:05	MALE:  I kind of go everywhere.  Ah, I'm from Australia, so when people leave Australia to live off wherever else you can stay away for a long time.  So I went backpacking around the world for a year.  A while ago, I've studied in Canada, lived in China and a few other places.  I'm going to go to Africa over the summer I think.
04:06  04:07	FEMALE:  Where you going to go?
