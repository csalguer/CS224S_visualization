00:21  00:23	MALE:  I mean their like, dude you're one over 169 you can not go in there.
00:24  00:30	FEMALE:  The service area will not allow it.  I mean I don't know how they measure sort of capacity issues.
00:31  00:32	MALE:  This doesn't tell you anything about their weight or like how much they ate --
00:33  00:34	FEMALE:  Right, [unintelligible] [laughter].  
00:36  00:37	MALE:  Or anything you know.

00:40  00:41	MALE:  Can't be accurate, it can't be accurate.
00:41  00:47	FEMALE:  Right and I also like that they distinguish between lounge and assembly.  So if you're all sprawled out, like.
00:48  00:49	MALE:  Yeah, you can only be in one or the other.
00:50  00:52	FEMALE:  Right, there's never any mixing.

01:07  01:11	MALE:  So, I don't want to ask you the standard questions but, maybe it's not time for that.
01:12  01:14	FEMALE:  You can ask me a non-standard one if you have a pile of those ready to go.
01:15  01:15	MALE:  What kind of car do you drive?
01:16  01:17	FEMALE:  What kind of car, Honda Civic.
01:17  01:18	MALE:  I'm very shallow.  I like women with nice [unintelligible] cars [laughter].
01:19  01:22	FEMALE:  Well, yeah, the blue Honda Civic is probably not going to meet your needs.
01:23  01:29	MALE:   Well, you won't like my '85 Ford Impala, Chevy Tracker there.

01:44  01:44	FEMALE:  But it fits.
01:45  01:48	MALE:  It's perfect.  We have no bad blood either.
01:49  01:49	FEMALE:  That's true --
01:50  01:50	MALE:  Other wise I'd be like --

02:12  02:13	MALE:  How did you like Portland?
02:13  02:14	FEMALE:  It's an awesome city to live in.
02:15  02:18	MALE:   A lot of my friends think that Portland is nice.  At least the ones I have in Portland.
02:19  02:25	FEMALE:  So the deal with Portland, I think, is that it's a fabulous city to live in, it's a terrible city to try and find a job in.
02:26  02:26	MALE:  Oh, okay.
02:27  02:28	FEMALE:  So, like people flock there because it's a great city to live in.
02:29  02:30	MALE:  Why is it so fun to live in?  What --
02:31  02:35	FEMALE:  It's a great mix of like cool -- great outdoor stuff right?  Like you're an hour from the coast and an hour from the mountains.
02:36  02:36	MALE:  Okay.
02:37  02:40	FEMALE:  It's got awesome like sort of -- there's a good like sort of intellectual life, like good bookstores, you know --
02:41  02:42	MALE:  Right, right, right [unintelligible].
02:42  02:42	FEMALE:  That's Powell's [phonetic].
02:43  02:44	MALE:  The Powell's, Powell's, my bad.
02:44  02:45	FEMALE:  Powell's which is like huge.
02:46  02:46	MALE:  A huge one, right.
02:47  02:50	FEMALE:  It's amazing and you've got -- you see that sort of the culture they bring a lot of authors to town.  You've got a pool downtown.
02:51  02:51	MALE:  The grunge bands.
02:52  03:01	FEMALE:  The grunge bands.  You've got some music.  You've got good food.  Like there's a lot of good food in that town.  Group pub type movie theaters I think are actually the secret.
03:02  03:02	MALE:  What is it?
03:03  03:04	FEMALE:  Group pub movie theaters.  So this is like a Portland phenomenon.
03:05  03:05	MALE:  Okay.
03:06  03:06	FEMALE:  Is that --
03:07  03:07	MALE:  You can drink at a theater.
03:08  03:41	FEMALE:  Well, basically there are all these movie theaters that are like -- I don't even know if it's second run.  They are a little delayed from the first run.  But basically, it's like the movies is three bucks and they've got -- and then it's a theater.  So there's like a McMenamins [phonetic] like dynasty which are these two brothers who just bought cool property.  So the Bagdad is this old theater like sort of real theater, but like you know with a balcony and everything that they've turned into a movie theater.  The Kennedy School was an elementary school they've turned into a hotel, bar, like cool place.  So like they've got that.  There is this other place called the Laurelhurst which has like multiple screens and all different micro-brew, so a big micro-brew town, lots of different companies.
03:42  03:44	MALE:  This is the place to hang out then.
03:45  03:46	FEMALE:  It's where you hang out, it gives you stuff to do.
03:47  03:48	MALE:  I hadn't heard about that that is cool.
03:48  03:51	FEMALE:  I'm really convinced, like it's this Portland thing and I don't know why other cities don't do it.
03:52  03:53	MALE:  So you drink before and after.
03:54  04:04	FEMALE:  You can do whatever, yeah.  I mean it's like the movie theaters have um, they usually have some sort of table structure, like sort of like you've got seats and some sort of table, something to put your drink down on basically.
04:06  04:07	MALE:  So, it's not like normal seating, seating then.
04:07  04:18	FEMALE:  Um, it's depending on the theater, there are some like so the [horn] that was an old theater, like they took out some rows of seats to put in tables in between and stuff like that.  But, a good time.
04:19  04:20	MALE:  I've only heard good things about Portland myself.
04:21  04:21	FEMALE:  Well, you know.
04:22  04:22	MALE:  Nice meeting you.
