0:00 0:01 MALE: Ow. 
0:02 0:03 FEMALE: That's a bad noise, isn't it. 
0:03 0:05 MALE: Yeah, this time, it's good.  It was, like, dimmer. 
0:06 0:07 FEMALE: I'm female335. 
0:07 0:08 MALE: male306. 
0:08 0:08 FEMALE: It's nice to meet you. 
0:08 0:11 MALE: Nice to meet you, too.  What do you do here?
0:11 0:13 FEMALE: Um, I'm getting my PhD in Biology. 
0:14 0:16 MALE: Okay.  Lots of smart people.
0:16 0:17 FEMALE: Oh, gosh. 
0:18 0:20 MALE: [unintelligible], but never good. 
0:20 0:30 FEMALE: Actually, I was a math major, so I also don't know much biology.  [laughter] But I study, uh, modeling, so really, we just do computer science-type stuff. 
0:31 0:33 MALE: [unintelligible] I don't understand [unintelligible]. 
0:34 0:35 FEMALE: What do you do?
0:35 0:39 MALE: I do a bunch of BS here.  I'm in Management Science and Engineering. 
0:39 0:39 FEMALE: Okay. 
0:41 0:42 MALE: So it's fun.  So--
0:42 0:53 FEMALE: Yeah.  MS and E is interesting.  And you, like--so I had to take some--I went to college here.  I had to take some classes in it as an under grad on, like, optimization theory and [unintelligible] processes and stuff. 
0:54 0:59 MALE: No, I, I don't take--I'm not in that division.  I'm, like, one step in B school, one step in school of engineering. 
1:00 1:00 FEMALE: Okay. 
1:01 1:02 MALE: That's why I said, "A bunch of BS."
1:02 1:08 FEMALE: Oh, I don't believe that.  How do you like it?
1:08 1:13 MALE: It's fun.  It's very different from what I was doing earlier.  I'm a CS [phonetic] under grad major. 
1:13 1:15 FEMALE: Okay.  You didn't like that so much?
1:16 1:21 MALE: I did, but I figured I would not--never--you know, better off sitting there in programs [unintelligible]. 
1:22 1:34 FEMALE: Yeah, I know.  I was talking to someone about that today, that, um, programing is the one thing that I can do for a really, really long time because I hate it so much.  Like I just want it to get done.  But other things just--I get distracted and I kind of can't sit for a very long time and do. 
1:34 1:40 MALE: Yeah.  True, I mean, if I really have to do it, in my under grad, we spent four years programing, so--
1:40 1:41 FEMALE: Right. 
1:41 1:44 MALE: But, yeah, [unintelligible] I'm not going to do it for the next 40 years of my life. 
1:44 1:54 FEMALE: Um hm.  Yeah, I know a lot of my friends, when we came to Stanford, um, it was right when the .com bubble was about to burst, but it hadn't yet, and so-- 
1:54 1:55 MALE:  Everybody down the hallways. 
1:55 2:09 FEMALE: Everybody wanted to study--yeah, because everybody was a CS major because everybody wanted to retire when they were 30 and be millionaires.  And now, all my friends, like, my guy friends are all engineers and kind of like, "Oh, we have to program our whole lives.  It's gonna be really awful."
2:10 2:10 MALE: Yeah. 
2:10 2:14 FEMALE: But that's why I got out of that.  So--
2:14 2:18 MALE: So what brought you here to this [unintelligible]--
2:17 2:26 FEMALE: Oh, um, actually, a good friend of mine is here as well.  Two of my friends, and, uh, we just thought it would be fun, you know?  It hard to meet new people, I think. 
2:27 2:30 MALE: I, I agree.  Especially when--in Stanford, it's just too much work all the time. 
2:30 2:38 FEMALE: Yeah, and everything's really isolated.  I mean, I live on campus, and even then, I don't really talk to people in my building very much, so, um--
2:38 2:42 MALE: And of course in my bunch of friends, it's, like, everybody's taken, hooked up. 
2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Yeah?
2:44 2:47 MALE: So they never go to any places.  I do hang around with them a lot. 
2:47 2:52 FEMALE: Yeah.  No, I know what you mean.  I'm also, like, one of the few single people in my program. [laughter] 
2:52 2:55 MALE: Yeah, it's difficult to meet single people [unintelligible]. 
2:55 2:55 FEMALE: It's true. 
2:56 2:57 MALE: So what do you do for fun?  Hang around?
2:58 3:00 FEMALE: Right now I work a lot, but, um--
3:00 3:01 MALE: Apart from working a lot.
3:01 3:19 FEMALE: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I just like to talk a lot, so I like to eat out and go to movies and drive around.  I mean, I'm from California, and so there's lots of fun places nearby to go hiking and stuff.  I like to do that.  And I hate running, but I do it.  Like CS.  So what about you?
3:20 3:28 MALE: Me, I'm not really--apart from hiking and going to the beach and just hanging out with my friends.  I, I love to rally drive.  I mean, I just love cars. 
3:28 3:29 FEMALE: Oh, wow. 
3:29 3:31 MALE: Yeah.  Unfortunately, I don't have a car here. 
3:31 3:33 FEMALE: So where do you go to fulfil this?
3:34 3:40 MALE: Nothing.  I haven't done it since, like--I've been here for, like, seven months now.  [unintelligible] seven months and [unintelligible]. 
3:41 3:44 FEMALE: I'm sure you could find, uh, somewhere you could at least watch race cars.
3:43 3:44 MALE: Oh, watching's not a problem. 
3:45 3:45 FEMALE: Okay. 
3:45 3:48 MALE: Yeah, there's no, no fun in watching anymore. 
3:48 3:56 FEMALE: Really?  So do you do the kind of thing where you, like, drive across the country in, like, stages and stuff like that?  That's kind of illegal I think. 
3:52 4:05 MALE: No, this is--you can do that here, but what I used to do in India a lot, uh, we have dirt tracks and stuff.  [unintelligible]. 
4:05 4:08 FEMALE: Yeah.  Oh, that's neat.  Well, it was nice to meet you.
4:07 4:08 MALE: It was good to meet you.
