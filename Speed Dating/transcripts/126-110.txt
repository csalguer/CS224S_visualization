01:28  	01:30  	FEMALE:  She emailed me and said do you want to sign up?

01:30  	01:30  	MALE:  Oh, okay.

01:31  	01:33  	FEMALE:  I later heard about it from two different emails.

01:33  	01:33  	MALE:  Right.

01:35  	01:37  	FEMALE:  But, yeah.  How about you?

01:37  	01:57  	MALE:  Um, well I got an email from on the [unintelligible] mailing list and um, I'm like I'm pretty opened minded, like I could do this, like why not [laughter].  So it's kind of fun, I like the experience.  [unintelligible] so [laughter].

01:57  	02:00  	FEMALE:  So tell me something that haven't said to anyone else tonight?

02:01  	02:02  	MALE:  Ah, like what kind of thing?

02:02  	02:09  	FEMALE:  Something about you -- or I don't know, some interesting fact that you know, I'm sure there are a lot of things that you've said yet tonight.

02:09  	02:21  	MALE:  Uh, yeah absolutely.  Um, like what area, like what interests you like my personal life or my passionate life or something I like to do for fun?

02:21  	02:22  	FEMALE:  Yeah, what do you like to do for fun?

02:23  	02:27  	MALE:  What do I like to do for fun?  Um, you know I've been asked that before [laughter].

02:28  	02:32  	FEMALE:  Well then tell me about your favorite color have you told anyone that?

02:32  	02:48  	MALE:  Oh, no I haven't.  I don't have -- I have two favorite colors, red and blue.  Red when you know really you know passionate about something and then blue I like to cool off.  Probably [unintelligible].

02:49  	02:51  	FEMALE:  Ah-huh, so hot and cold colors.

02:51  	02:52  	MALE:  Yeah how about you?

02:52  	03:27  	FEMALE:  I'm more of cool person.  I -- when I was little I loved purples.  I had these purple corduroy pants and it was really hard to pull me out of them because I loved them so much but then I went through a blue phase.  I'm thinking maybe because purple was such a girly color and I was in sports and I didn't want to be you know, viewed as you know, girly person.  I wanted to compete on a level with the guys.  So I think sort of subconsciously I started moving towards blue because I thought it was more masculine color.  

03:27	03:27	MALE:  Awesome.

03:28	03:29	FEMALE:  But everyone tells me that blue does not look good on me.

03:29  	03:29  	MALE:  Really.

03:30  	03:32  	FEMALE:   So I can't tell what color like what clothes look good on me.

03:33  	03:33  	MALE:  Right.

03:34  	03:37  	FEMALE:  And lots of people say you look good in purple and I thought you know I used like purple, maybe I'll go back to purple again. 

03:36	03:37	MALE:  Oh, okay.

03:37	03:57	FEMALE:  But there's this fondness in my heart for blue, but I'm adopting purple and I enjoy purple you know?  But it's got that feminine connotation to it.  Blue's a little more neutral.  Like blue can be feminine or masculine but purple is girly.

03:58  	03:58  	MALE:  Really [laughter].

03:59  	04:01  	FEMALE:  I mean I'm interesting in purple yet [horn].

04:01  	04:04  	MALE:  Yeah, I mean I hear you.

04:04  	04:05  	FEMALE:  Red and blue are very good neutral color.

04:06  	04:11  	MALE:  Well, red could be -- well, I guess you're right. 

04:10  	04:15  	FEMALE:  If you lighten it, it's pink or something.  Bright red you could be masculine.

04:16  	04:20  	MALE:  Yeah, and it's so funny because purple is the combination of the two.  Well, it's good to meet you [laughter].

04:21  	04:22  	FEMALE:  [laughter].
