0:32 0:34 FEMALE: It's okay.  It's--
0:34 0:35 MALE: It's okay.  It's not the best?
0:35 0:36 FEMALE: --kind of very [unintelligible].
0:36 0:37 MALE: It is kind of bizarre, isn't it?  Nice to meet you, by the way.
0:37 0:37 FEMALE: Yeah.  My brain is [unintelligible].
0:39 0:40 MALE: I see you've got a high tech microphone also.
0:40 0:41 FEMALE: Yes.  We all do.
0:41 0:41 MALE: I think [unintelligible] with these sort of low, you know--
0:45 0:45 FEMALE: Oh my.
0:46 0:48 MALE: --low technology [laughter].  I [unintelligible] what you have to say is more interesting.
0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Perhaps.
0:49 0:53 MALE: It's already a gender biased study.  I'm going to file a formal protest.
0:53 0:54 FEMALE: Well at least [unintelligible].  It's being run by a woman.
0:54 0:57 MALE: You should take that up with Senela [unintelligible] afterwards.
0:57 0:57 FEMALE: If I do it, I want one of the cool ones.
0:57 1:00 MALE: Yeah.  I want a cool--like, [unintelligible] that little--what is that?
1:00 1:02 FEMALE: Little mic.  I don't know.
1:03 1:12 MALE: I'm concerned that I'm operating in conditions of sub-optimal [laughter], uh, microphone pick up [laughter].  Yeah.  So yeah, this is pretty bizarre.  I've never done this before.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE: No, me neither.
1:13 1:14 MALE: This is your first stake at it?
1:14 1:14 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:15 1:17 MALE: How did--did you just get linked in through--
1:18 1:18 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:18 1:19 MALE: --email?  Or do you know someone who's running it or?  
1:20 1:20 FEMALE: Um, email.
1:21 1:21 MALE: Yeah.
1:21 1:24 FEMALE: So it's like, need more engineering women.  I was like, oh.  Okay.
1:24 1:24 MALE: Need more--
1:24 1:25 FEMALE: Why not [laughter].
1:26 1:27 MALE: What are you doing in engineering?
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: Uh, material science.
1:29 1:29 MALE: That's hard.
1:30 1:30 FEMALE: Um--
1:31 1:31 MALE: Yeah.
1:32 1:32 FEMALE: I mean--
1:32 1:35 MALE: What do you want to do with that?  Do you have any idea?  Do you want to teach?
1:36 1:42 FEMALE: Uh, teaching is a possibility.  Um, I'm actually in the master's program.  So I could [unintelligible] PhD if I wanted do anything with that.
1:42 1:44 MALE: So you might go to work afterwards, then.
1:44 1:48 FEMALE: Um, I actually just interviewed at Google this morning for a marketing position.
1:48 1:49 MALE: Oh cool.  That's different.
1:49 1:53 FEMALE: Which is nothing at all in engineering.  But kind of nice to try something else.
1:53 1:54 MALE: Is that like a summer or permanent?
1:54 1:55 FEMALE: Permanent.  
1:57 1:58 MALE: Wouldn't be a bad company to join.
1:58 2:00 FEMALE: I know.  It's a really good opportunity.
2:01 2:01 MALE: Yeah.
2:01 2:04 FEMALE: They're kind of doing like a training thing, so you don't have to know what you're doing, necessarily.
2:04 2:06 MALE: Oh nice.  And would you live down here?  Would you live in the city?
2:07 2:07 FEMALE: Um, it's in Mountain View.
2:08 2:09 MALE: But I mean, would you commute or--
2:10 2:11 FEMALE: No.  I mean, I'd probably stay here.
2:11 2:12 MALE: You like it down here?
2:12 2:14 FEMALE: Yeah.  I do.  Yeah.
2:14 2:16 MALE: Better than the city?  Have you lived in the city?
2:16 2:17 FEMALE: I do like the city too.  Well I--
2:17 2:18 MALE: Oh the city's fun.
2:18 2:21 FEMALE: I went to school in Boston, so I kind of got a lot of city.  And now I'm back here and it's kind of--
2:21 2:21 MALE: Yeah.
2:22 2:24 FEMALE: And I also, I horseback ride.  So--
2:24 2:25 MALE: Oh my mom's a three day eventer.
2:26 2:27 FEMALE: Really?
2:27 2:27 MALE: Yes.
2:27 2:29 FEMALE: Oh my goodness.  That's what I do [laughter].
2:29 2:36 MALE: And I survived.  That's what you do?  Come on.  Oh my god.  I've been to all--I've been to [unintelligible], I've been to--wait--
2:36 2:37 FEMALE: Oh my goodness [laughter].
2:37 2:42 MALE: What's that [unintelligible]?  What's the one that starts with a G?  Groden [phonetic] House?  I've been to Radner [phonetic].
2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Louis?
2:44 2:44 MALE: What?
2:44 2:44 FEMALE: Louis?  In Kentucky?
2:46 2:53 MALE: I have not--no.  She's gone to that, but I haven't been to that event.  I mean, have you heard of the [unintelligible] trials?  I'm from upstate New York.  I'm from Rochester. 
2:53 2:53 FEMALE: Wow.
2:54 2:59 MALE: So I grew up with the Stewarts, the woman who started that.  God, horse riding. 
2:59 2:59 FEMALE: Do you ride?
2:59 3:01 MALE: I don't.  My brother was a rider, but--
3:02 3:02 FEMALE: Why not [laughter]?
3:04 3:12 MALE: You know what?  I was always like the, uh, the younger brother who had to sit in the car on Saturday mornings while he went to pony club.  So I think I was scarred as a child.
3:12 3:13 FEMALE: Well you could have gone too.
3:13 3:16 MALE: Well my mom is really into it.  She has a horse that still does it and...
3:17 3:19 FEMALE: What does she ride?  What kind?  A thoroughbred?
3:20 3:23 MALE: Uh [laughter] Okay.  Wait.  Um.
3:23 3:24 FEMALE: You don't know what [unintelligible].
3:24 3:26 MALE: All I know is like there's prelims and there's--
3:27 3:27 FEMALE: Novice.
3:28 3:28 MALE: Novice.
3:28 3:29 FEMALE: Training.
3:29 3:31 MALE: Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  She's pretty into it.
3:32 3:32 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:32 3:37 MALE: My brother was a really good rider.  Actually, in his, um, [unintelligible], his horse had an aneurism in the cross country course. 
3:38 3:38 FEMALE: Oh no.
3:38 3:49 MALE: And died right before a fence, and went through--you know, the horse died.  He got thrown off the fence.  And was like 16.  He was a really good rider.  He just like got out of the sport.
3:50 3:50 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
3:51 3:52 MALE: Broke his collar bone, and was like, you know what? It just left a bad taste in his mouth.
3:52 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's hard.
3:54 3:57 MALE: And my mom then, when he went to college, picked it up. And--
3:57 3:58 FEMALE: Oh wow, that's very strange.  Yeah.
3:58 3:59 MALE: But she's silly into it.  I mean, she's like--
3:59 4:00 FEMALE: There's mom.  Don't die.
4:00 4:01 MALE: Well no, but she was a rider growing up. 
4:01 4:02 FEMALE: Oh okay.
4:02 4:04 MALE: So she was like his, uh, groom?  Is that what you call it?
4:05  4:06 FEMALE: When you kind of brush out your horse?
4:06  4:07 MALE: Yeah.  Like she, you know--
4:07 4:07 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
4:08 4:09 MALE: took care--you know, helped him and all this stuff at all the events and-- 
4:09 4:10 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:10 4:21 MALE: The big watch--you know, I remember all these things.  And his, uh, the vest that he used to wear [unintelligible] you know, piece together childhood memories of going to horsing events.  
4:21 4:21 FEMALE: That you can try to forget right?  [laughter] Really.
4:21 4:27 MALE: The videos of the--of their--you know.  So you do three [unintelligible]?
4:27 4:28 FEMALE: Oh my goodness.  Yeah, I would like to start.
4:28 4:34 MALE: Out here?  Oh my god.  That's a crazy sport; it's the sport of kings.  It's expensive.  [unintelligible] here.
4:35 4:39 FEMALE: Yeah. I mean, I don't have a horse.  So I just ride someone else's in competitions.
4:39 4:40 MALE: Oh [unintelligible] and they'll have to deal with it.
4:40 4:40 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:41 4:41 MALE: Well it was nice to meet you.
