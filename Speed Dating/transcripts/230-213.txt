0:01 0:02 FEMALE: Hi.

0:03 0:04 MALE: Hey female230.

0:02 0:04 FEMALE: I'm female230.  Nice to meet you.

0:04 0:06 MALE: I'm male213.  Nice to meet you too.

0:04 0:13 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  I just realized I made a mistake, like, you know where it says one to ten, and I got it--I got it sort of confused, so I'm going to have to do the explaining [unintelligible].  What do you do?

0:14 0:18 MALE: Okay.  Well, you're not really going to have to explain it to anybody, so.

0:16 0:27 FEMALE: That is true, that is true.  But I'll feel bad by screwing up the, you know, you know how it is when you're trying to do a research experiment and this one, like, weird case that is clustered, all the results are clustered to that.  I don't know.  Maybe I might [unintelligible].

0:28 0:30 MALE: Are you saying that you said bad things about nameX?

0:28 0:36 FEMALE: No, that's the thing, I--I mean all, I said all cluster, like, towards, like, one end, so I got it confused.  I thought one was a lot and, like, [unintelligible].

0:38 0:39 MALE: Oh.

0:37 0:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:39 0:40 MALE: I'm sure it's fine.

0:38 0:39 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:40 0:41 MALE: Oh okay, yeah, they might want to know about that.  That's backwards. 

0:41 0:42 FEMALE: But uh--

0:44 0:47 MALE: So what do you like to do?  Who are you?  All that stuff.

0:45 0:48 FEMALE: Well I'm MS and E.  I'm in--I'm a master student.

0:50 0:51 MALE: Cool.

0:48 1:00 FEMALE: I quite like my classes, so I have to mention that.  Uh I like, I don't know.  I like traveling actually.  Um, my father's a pilot so we've always had the privilege of being--once a year we get those free tickets that they give as part of the benefits.

1:02 1:04 MALE: Oh no kidding.  Where are you from?

1:02 1:03 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore.  

1:05 1:06 MALE: Okay.  

1:03 1:10 FEMALE: So he works for Singapore Airlines, so every year we'd make a point of like a family holiday together, so I like to travel to different places.  I like music and art [unintelligible].

1:12 1:14 MALE: What kind of music do you like?

1:12 1:13 FEMALE: I actually play the piano and I sing, so--

1:15 1:16 MALE: Oh awesome.

1:14 1:34 FEMALE: When I sang at college I sang a cappella, so that's kind of what I--that was my latest fad that I like a lot.  But when I play piano I'm definitely stuck in a classical era.  Classical, romantic is as far as I go.  But uh, what else, anything artsy-fartsy like books or that kind of thing, [unintelligible] and [unintelligible].

1:36 1:39 MALE: Anything artsy-fartsy.  So female230 is artsy-fartsy and outdoors.  I'll keep that in mind.

1:38 1:41 FEMALE: If she--if she could be classified that easily, but uh, how about you.

1:44 2:00 MALE: I know, I'm sure not.  Um well, my music, my music is sadly not really happening anymore.  I played cello like most of my life.  And um that was my--that, that had always been my artistic outlet, and I'm doing improv theater right now for fun.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: That's awesome.

2:01 2:05 MALE: And actually it has the main thing I didn't like about playing the cello, which--

2:03 2:04 FEMALE: [unintelligible]?

2:06 2:21 MALE: Yeah.  Exactly.  It's that, you know, I kind of felt--there was a time when I thought that I should've been a musician, but the thing that finally, like, really just turned me is just talking that I would be training my entire life to play somebody else's music.

2:19 2:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:22 2:23 MALE: And play it really well, so--

2:21 2:22 FEMALE: Did you try writing your own music?

2:25 2:30 MALE: I didn't because I didn't have enough theory background to be able to do that, you know, to feel like I could do a fair shot at it.

2:28 2:31 FEMALE: Maybe someday, after retirement or something.  It's my--

2:33 2:34 MALE: Yeah.  

2:31 2:35 FEMALE: --my ambition to be, like, write my own music and my own book.  Maybe yourself, because you could develop that training.

2:37 2:44 MALE: Yeah.  Writing a book, that's, that's a tempting idea.  I mean what makes a person [unintelligible] book.

2:41 2:42 FEMALE: What do you do now by the way?

2:44 2:45 MALE: I do um--

2:42 2:45 FEMALE: Yeah, that's true, that is true, but you have two sides standards, you know.  

2:47 2:48 MALE: Sorry? 

2:45 2:53 FEMALE: Sometimes books are just meant as artistic expression of your own personality, whether or not you want it to sell can be another issue altogether.  But uh, what do you do now?

2:55 3:01 MALE: I'm doing electrical engineering and I want to do--I plan to do medical devices when I'm out of school.

2:59 3:00 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:01 3:03 MALE: And I just got a medical devices internship.

3:01 3:07 FEMALE: I swear, I just met another guy who said the same thing as you.  EE and he's interested in medical devices.  There's some other--there's definitely [unintelligible].

3:10 3:12 MALE: Some guy listened to me and, like--

3:09 3:10 FEMALE: No, no.  

3:12 3:13 MALE: Is being me for tonight.

3:10 3:12 FEMALE: No, but uh, no.

3:15 3:18 MALE: Well it's a good field to do, I can understand that other people want to do it, not just me.

3:16 3:18 FEMALE: Are you a master's or PhD?

3:20 3:21 MALE: PhD.

3:19 3:20 FEMALE: So you, you'll [unintelligible].

3:22 3:23 MALE: What do you want to do when you're out of school?

3:22 3:24 FEMALE: Well I don't really have a choice.

3:26 3:28 MALE: Oh are you obligated to, okay, yeah.

3:25 3:29 FEMALE: The Singapore government paid for my, yeah.  Do you have Singapore friends in the same situation?

3:31 3:36 MALE: Um I've met--I've met a bunch of people who, who've said things like that.  Yeah.  I know, I know an undergrad guy named nameX..

3:34 3:35 FEMALE: nameX or--?

3:37 3:38 MALE: nameX.

3:36 3:37 FEMALE: nameX, oh.  [unintelligible].

3:39 3:44 MALE: Okay.  I don't remember what he studies either, but uh, nice guy if you ever meet him.

3:40 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah, so they pay us and we have to work for them after that, so.  Which is fine, I mean, for me I don't pity myself that much because I went in there actually having some interest in working for government.  I might even, if it works out, you know, if I find that the bureaucracy doesn't kill me or anything [horn] I might consider that for a long-term career.  'Cause I'm quite interested in that.

3:59 4:02 MALE: For, sort of, for like, your lifetime job?

3:59 4:03 FEMALE: Yeah.  [unintelligible] and you, probably academics or you're not sure?

4:06 4:07 MALE: No, I, I really want to do something.

4:05 4:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  

4:07 4:10 MALE: Like I want to make something, like some real kind of device.

4:07 4:11 FEMALE: I know.  But I'm sorry, yeah.  It's nice to meet you.  We're always like [unintelligible].

4:13 4:16 MALE: Yeah.  Nice to meet you too.  Thanks.
