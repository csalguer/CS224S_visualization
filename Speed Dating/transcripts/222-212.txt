1:02 1:03 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Cool.  [laughter].

1:05 1:13 MALE: It was interesting.  So I mean in my spare time I do, you know, various things, you know -- traditional music concerts, theater, and like this quarter I'm doing French cooking lessons every other Thursday.

1:13 1:15 FEMALE: Oh, that's really interesting. 

1:16 1:16 MALE: Yeah.

1:15 1:17 FEMALE: You're - like a wide variety of interests -

1:17 1:17 MALE: Yeah, I mean -

1:18 1:19 FEMALE: - to keep yourself busy.  That's cool.

1:18 1:22 MALE: - and I get credit for it, you know, not quite Master's degree credit.

1:22 1:24 FEMALE: [laughter].  Yeah.  Cool, so you like to cook?

1:27 1:31 MALE: More and more, I guess, I -- I really didn't have a lot of skills when I started out this year.

1:30 1:30 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

1:33 1:41 MALE: It's developed pretty well.  I have my little George Foreman grill and I just like -- I slap the fish on and I open the fridge and find a random sauce and -  

1:40 1:40 FEMALE: I see.

1:41 1:46 1:04 MALE: - spray it on.  But the pastry stuff is helping, I mean, this Thursday we're doing 'eclairs.

1:45 1:45 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

1:48 1:51 MALE: We did like truffles, and -

1:50 1:51 FEMALE: Wow.  That's hard -- that hardcore.

1:52 1:53 MALE: It is.

1:52 1:52 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:52 1:53 MALE: You'll have to do it in your next quarter.

1:54 1:54 FEMALE: [laughter].  Oh, it's here?

1:56 1:59 MALE: Yeah, yeah, it's at -- there's like a French dorm on Mayfield Avenue or something -

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Really?  I had no idea.

1:59 2:00 MALE: Oh, yeah, yeah.

2:00 2:00 FEMALE: Oh.

2:02 2:04 MALE: And they do wine-tasting and cooking, and like French cinema and -

2:04 2:10 FEMALE: Wow.  Cool.  So -- I'm so sad.  I'm like -- I'm leaving, and I didn't even know about this.

2:11 2:12 MALE: You're leaving?  Oh.

2:10 2:13 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  You just started your program here, or -

2:14 2:17 MALE: Yeah, well I started and finished.  I mean, it's only a one-year program, so - 

2:19 2:20 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Yeah, me too.  So I'm like, oh it's almost, like, over.

2:23 2:28 MALE: Yeah, I mean we just got here, and just when you get the systems down, like the bus lines and everything, it's time to pack up and leave.

2:29 2:31 FEMALE: That's true.  Do you want to stick around the area, or...?

2:32 2:43 MALE: Sort of, but not really.  I mean it's sort of a little too expensive for me, like the cost of living and actually like getting ahead and things, but uh - I really like maybe a little back in the Midwest where I'm from, or -

2:43 2:44 FEMALE: Oh, where are you - 

2:44 2:46 MALE: - sort of Middle Atlantic, or like Florida would be pretty cool.

2:46 2:47 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  So you -- so you're not from California?

2:47 2:49 MALE: No, are you or...?

2:49 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm from California.  I love the place.  [laughter].  Yeah. 

2:54 2:55 MALE: NorCal or SoCal?

2:53 2:57 FEMALE: I'm proudly SoCal, but I lived in NorCal almost the same amount of time -

2:58 2:58 MALE: Oh, really?

2:58 2:59 FEMALE: - as I did in South -- SoCal, so...

3:00 3:02 MALE: So, do you like it better up here, or...?

3:02 3:06 FEMALE: Um... I like the environment up here, but my family's down South, so...

3:03 3:03 MALE:  Right.

3:07 3:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So -- I mean, I like both equally, I guess.

3:11 3:16 MALE: Yeah, like once graduation comes around, I'm going to, you know, like fulfill the commercial and go down to Disneyland, I think.

3:16 3:18 FEMALE: Yes, you should, that's on their 50th anniversary.

3:20 3:25 MALE: Exactly, yeah.  Yeah, so I hope to like for Disney someday, like I've sent in applications and stuff.  

3:23 3:25 FEMALE: Oh, really?  In doing like what kind of -  

3:25 3:29 MALE: Engineering, like -- 

3:26 3:27 FEMALE: Oh, okay.

3:28 3:30 MALE: - either that or like sort of communications, guest relations-type stuff, so...

3:30 3:34 FEMALE: Cool.  That's really fun.  Yeah, one of my friends just started her job at Disney.

3:33 3:34 MALE: Oh, really?

3:34 3:39  FEMALE: Yeah, um, she was -- I think she was in Communications, and um, yeah, so she likes it a lot, yeah.

3:41 3:46 MALE: It sounds like a cool program, if I can only get like a "yes" letter -- I haven't been quite as successful as I wanted to.

3:46 3:47 FEMALE: Okay.  Cool.

3:48 3:59 MALE: Is there any other things you recommend doing in the Los Angeles area?  You've got like the Walt Disney concert hall, and -

3:53 4:05 FEMALE: Uh, food, restaurants.  Lots of restaurants there. [laughter].  Um, yeah, I guess, I don't know, Hollywood, if you're into that.  But yeah.  Well, it was nice meeting you.

4:07 4:10 MALE: I'll have to find a French, you know, pastry restaurant or something and we can compare techniques.

4:09 4:12 FEMALE: [laughter].  Yeah, you should.  That would be really cool.  [laughter].  All right, have fun.

4:13 4:15 MALE: All right.  Take care, nice meeting you.
