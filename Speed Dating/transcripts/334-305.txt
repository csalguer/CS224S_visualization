0:18 0:19 MALE: Okay. 
0:26 0:31 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's, um, um--see, I think it would be, like, uh, pharmaceutical consultant. 
0:24 0:24 MALE: Um huh.
0:31 0:38 FEMALE: Trying to help them with investing and that sort of thing, what discoveries to invest in and what to, just, completely ignore. 
0:32 0:35 MALE: Very interesting.  I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering. 
0:42 0:42 FEMALE: Double-E.  All right. 
0:36 0:39 MALE: Double-E.  So it's, uh--we are not all that [unintelligible].  
0:46 0:47 FEMALE: Have you got past your quals yet?
0:40 0:42 MALE: No, not yet.  So I'm a first year. 
0:48 0:49 FEMALE: I came for the, uh--
0:43 0:49 MALE: Right, right.  It's pretty tough, and actually, I had been in the industry for several years.  So I decided to take my quals my second year. 
0:56 1:05 FEMALE: Oh, I--yeah.  I, uh, I have a friend who's doing chemical engineering.  Not here, but at Cal Tech, and she's like, "It's very competitive, very tough."  You guys--
0:59 1:10 MALE: Right.  It's, it's pretty tough.  Actually, the, the thing is, that it's a set of--there, there are, like, the first 70 people who pass, and the rest are just out.  And that's how it works.  It's not--
1:17 1:19 FEMALE: So it's a lot of studying?
1:12 1:13 MALE: Yeah, it's a lot of studying.
1:19 1:20 FEMALE: The first couple of years, and then-- 
1:13 1:18 MALE: Yeah.  And, uh, and then, uh, we'll see.  But, uh, it's pretty interesting.  I am, uh--

1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Oh, okay. 
1:35 1:37 MALE: So what were you doing in Oviedo?
1:43 1:44 FEMALE: I was studying there.

1:44 1:48 FEMALE: For six weeks in a program at [unintelligible]. 
1:41 1:56 MALE: Okay.  I was in, uh--I, I am originally from Nevarre, which is east of Oviedo.  So you have Oviedo--I mean, actually Asturias, uh, [unintelligible] the Basque country in Nevarre.  So it's, it's in the--
2:01 2:03 FEMALE: Right.  Okay.  Okay.  Right. Yes.
1:56 1:58 MALE: It's in the border with France, basically.  
2:04 2:04 FEMALE: Right. 
1:59 2:04 MALE: Uh, that's where I'm originally from, and then I've been in the United States for--this is my fifth year in the Bay area.
2:10 2:13 FEMALE: Fifth year.  So were you at an undergrad here?
2:06 2:10 MALE: Uh, no, no, no.  I came, uh--I was--I came to work for Hewlett-Packard.  
2:17 2:17 FEMALE: Oh, yeah. 
2:11 2:27 MALE: In [unintelligible].  So I began to work with HP in Spain, and then I move here four years ago.  Then, uh, after four years ago of working, I was a bit tired of, uh, everything.  I decided to apply, and, uh, that's why I'm--that's why I'm here.  This is my first year as Double-E student.
2:34 2:36 FEMALE: So how do you like Stanford?
2:30 2:30 MALE: Great. 
2:37 2:37 FEMALE: Yeah?
2:30 2:34 MALE: I mean, I like--okay.  First of all, I like Silicon Valley a lot.
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: Um hm. 
2:34 2:45 MALE: So I am a fanatic of Silicon Valley, and I like Stanford a lot.  So that's, uh--it's a--it's a really nice university.  Sure, it has --I mean, not--nothing is perfect, right? 
2:53 2:54 FEMALE: Well, what don't you like?
2:48 2:51 MALE: Uh, sometimes things go truly fast. 
2:59 2:59 FEMALE: Go really fast?
2:53 2:56 MALE: I mean, the, the, the pace a person in the Double-E department-- 
3:01 3:06 FEMALE: Mm.  Is that--is that a characteristic of Stanford or the United States?
3:00 3:01 MALE: Uh, no.  Stanford. 
3:08 3:09 FEMALE: Stanford?  Definitely?
3:02 3:08 MALE: Right, it was--definitely.  I mean, Silicon Valley, maybe it goes also fast, but I mean, like, the course work, it goes truly fast. 
3:14 3:17 FEMALE: Oh, yeah.  Course work, even ours, it's just like--
3:11 3:12 MALE: [Makes noise]
3:19 3:19 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:13 3:17 MALE: Uh, but I mean, it's just to give [unintelligible] something because I really like Stanford.  I mean, it's not--
3:25 3:26 FEMALE: It's, it's beautiful. 
3:19 3:20 MALE: It's beautiful.
3:26 3:28 FEMALE: The campus is absolutely beautiful. 
3:21 3:22 MALE: Uh, the people are really nice.  
3:29 3:29 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:23 3:30 MALE: It's very interesting people--and I have met a lot of interesting people.  Everything is nice, so it's really--I really like this university a lot.

3:33 3:34 MALE: Right. 
3:41 3:43 FEMALE: I haven't done my quals yet.  Actually, those are in July.
3:37 3:37 MALE: Okay. 
3:43 3:45 FEMALE: But we all pass. 
3:38 3:40 MALE: [laughter] It's not the same type of quals. 
3:46 3:49 FEMALE: No, it's not.  We have guaranteed funding, so it's different. 
3:42 3:42 MALE: Okay. 
3:50 3:52 FEMALE: Um, over in the medical school, but, uh--
3:45 3:48 MALE: Okay.  But, it's, it's mostly, like, [unintelligible]?
3:55 3:58 FEMALE: The entrance is a l--is pretty selective.  Um, but--
3:51 3:59 MALE: You know, the, the, the entrance of the Double-E's also pretty selective, but it's, it's just that they really do this.  I mean, they are admit a bunch of student for both Master's and PhDs. 
4:06 4:08 FEMALE: We only admit, like, ten people. 
4:01 4:03 MALE: Oh, okay.  No, it's no that selective. 
4:09 4:11 FEMALE: Yeah.  Well, it's good to meet you, male305. 
4:04 4:07 MALE: Good to meet you, and, uh, good luck with everything.
