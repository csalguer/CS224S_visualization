FILE NAME: 323_301


0:55 0:58 MALE: Like who like initiates the date and then, like, talks the most or something?
0:05 0:05 FEMALE: I guess, yeah.
1:01 1:01 MALE: That would be assertive?
0:06 0:13 FEMALE: Or if they, like, squeeze your hand real hard.  male301, are you having fun?
1:08 1:09 MALE: So far, so good.  Yeah.
0:17 0:19 FEMALE: You get two of the cutest ladies right back to back. [laughter]
1:11 1:15 MALE: I know, right?  Back to back. Shoot. I don't know.
0:21 0:23 FEMALE: You get stood up the next day though.
1:19 1:28 MALE: Oh.  That's, that's rough I start with one person then I have two friends and then I have a blankie. People will be worn out by the time I get there, by the time I ever actually even go on a date.
0:35 0:43 FEMALE: They've already-- I think they've already met their ideal match. I like date number four.  You missed your opportunity.
1:32 1:39 MALE: [laughter] Yeah.  I'm out. Shoot.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE: Did nameX warn about not eating Oreos?
1:44 1:46 MALE: No because of the trans fatty?
0:53 0:53 FEMALE: What?
1:47 1:47 MALE: Why?
0:54 0:58 FEMALE: Not because of the trans fatty because you've got Oreo stuff in your teeth. [laughter]
1:54 1:54 MALE: But you're also no garlic.
1:01 1:11 FEMALE: Yes, no garlic. Actually to me it's just as ridiculous to be eating Teddy Grahams on an adult date. But I guess it's a risk for dental blemishes isn't quite as high.
2:04 2:17 MALE: The one I went to at ED, it was in that house that's right up at the end of Escondido.  And they have roses and rose petals everywhere.  And there is wine and they have lots of drinks.  Halfway through that intermission and they brought in, um...
1:24 1:24 FEMALE: A band?
2:19 2:23 MALE: They brought in dancers, like swing dancers. They did a couple of little swing dances and then that's--
1:30 1:30 FEMALE: Well leave it to the school of Ed to do all the cheap.
2:25 2:30 MALE: I know, right.  So I guess where ever it ends up.
1:38 1:45 FEMALE: I don't like talking about my life very much, you know?  I'm just so exhausted by it right now that it's just I don't want to talk about teaching.
2:39 2:43 MALE: Yeah. I know say I'm a teacher and tell them about the exciting cookies you baked today or something.
1:50 1:53 FEMALE: Or I made myself sick on cookies right before I came here.
2:48 2:53 MALE: You got to have something new.  I feel like you don't have to have the same shpiel for everyone.
1:59 1:59 FEMALE: No.
2:54 3:00 MALE: You got to talk about a different portion of it.  Maybe yet you don't have your best shpiel for the best person but at least it's interesting for you.
2:07 2:16 FEMALE: Well the other advantage is that you can try out a bunch of different shpiels and if you hit one you like you can repeat for the best person.  Then it's like you actually already practiced.
3:10 3:12 MALE: That's true, that's true. You figured it out.
2:19 2:19 FEMALE: Yup.
3:13 3:13 MALE: Let me try one.
2:22 2:22 FEMALE: Okay.
3:17 3:17 MALE: Um, female323, is that right?
2:24 2:24 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:18 3:19 MALE: Have you ever dated a guy with facial hair before?
2:26 2:28 FEMALE: Yeah. I didn't work out though.
3:21 3:24 MALE: Oh. Would you be willing to give it another try. Just asking you to keep an open mind, that's all I'm really asking.
2:33 2:36 FEMALE: If he keeps it nice and trim, perhaps. If it gets all scraggly.
3:30 3:31 MALE: Sometimes I get scraggly.
2:39 2:39 FEMALE: It's not going to work for me.
3:34 3:35 MALE: You don't like whisker burn?
2:41 2:51 FEMALE: No. I don't like whisker burn. I actually can't think of any kind of burn I like. [laughter] I pretty much uniformly dislike burn.
3:44 3:45 MALE: Disliking the burn.
2:56 2:56 FEMALE: So are you--
3:51 3:52 MALE: I promise never to burn.
3:00 3:10 FEMALE: Well thank you. That's more than most people can ever promise. So you go to Melissa-- no you're going to the eight game tomorrow night.
4:04 4:06 MALE: I'm going to the A's game tomorrow. Why don't you guys want to go to that?
3:14 3:21 FEMALE: I don't know. I don't want to socialize with STEP people right now, you know?
4:12 4:22 MALE: Oh. You don't? The last time I had gone it's just been really fun. Like, no one talks about jobs anymore or things like that.
3:28 3:28 FEMALE: Yeah?
4:23 4:23 MALE: No one talks about STEPs.
3:31 3:31 FEMALE: Yeah? Where have you gone recently?
4:25 4:31 MALE: I had just gone last weekend. I went with nameX and his friend and nameX and all those guys. You guys are going to the warren thing on Saturday, right?
3:39 3:40 FEMALE: I wasn't invited.
4:34 4:37 MALE: No one was invited. If you come, just kind of just pass that along.
3:44 3:45 FEMALE: All right. Well I'm going anyway.
4:40 4:40 MALE: Yeah. You should come.
3:48 3:49 FEMALE: But I like saying that I wasn't invited.
4:42 4:46 MALE: Yeah. He didn't invite anyone. He invited, like, two STEP people and then everybody had to like word of mouth.
3:54 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm going. Is it in the afternoon or what?
4:49 4:50 MALE: Yeah. It's afternoon until whenever.
3:58 4:01 FEMALE: Do you know what? I may have to work from 4:00 to 8:00
4:56 4:58 MALE: Oh yeah? At least come for food even if you can't come for drinks.
4:06 4:08 FEMALE: I'll come before and after. What time does it start?
5:01 5:01 MALE: Like, 1:00.
4:10 4:12 FEMALE: Yeah. I'll come then.
5:03 5:03 MALE: Yeah.
4:13 4:13 FEMALE: Bye male301.
5:03 5:04 MALE: Bye. Good to meet you.
4:14 4:14 FEMALE: Thanks.
