00:01  	00:02  	MALE:  [horn] Hi, [unintelligible].

00:02  	00:05  	FEMALE:  I'm female125, nice to meet you.

00:05  	00:06  	MALE:  Nice to meet you again [laughter].

00:08  	00:09  	FEMALE:  So what are you doing here at Stanford?

00:10  	00:12	MALE:  What am I doing here at Stanford?  I came back to get my Masters.

00:12  	00:12  	FEMALE:  Okay.

00:13  	00:19  	MALE:  I got tired of working and decided I needed a Masters to do what I wanted to do and here I am?

00:19  	00:20  	FEMALE:  That sounds like me.

00:20  	00:22  	MALE:  Right on.  What did you do before?

00:22  	00:30  	FEMALE:  Um, I did various things in education.  I did lot of different jobs in the education department and then I'm getting a Master's in student politics?  

00:30  	00:30  	MALE:  Nice.

00:31  	00:31  	FEMALE:  How about you?

00:32  	00:41  	MALE:  I did a lot of work in working -- working in a factory and doing engineering at factories.  So now mostly computer stuff now I wanted to do, mechanical stuff and see stuff move.

00:41  	00:42  	FEMALE:  Do you build things?

00:43  	00:51  	MALE:  Yes.  Put together little robots for all my projects.  I think I've gotten to the point where I don't ever have to do another problem set or final.  I just need to build stuff, which is really great. 

00:51  	00:59  	FEMALE:  That's impressive.  I'd just be so awful at that.  I'm geometrical challenged.  

00:59  	00:59	MALE:  [laughter]

00:59  	01:12  	FEMALE:  One of my roommates is actually an aero/asto engineer.  Um, so she's constantly like, [unintelligible].  My other roommate who is also in education too and I just look at it and we're like, why is your entire book in Greek [laughter]?

01:12  	01:12  	MALE:  [laughter]

01:13  	01:18  	FEMALE:  We don't understand that.  We're not [unintelligible].

01:18  	01:19  	MALE:  Pull it out and it's like it looks the same as [unintelligible].  That's all the difference.

01:20	01:29	FEMALE:  Yeah [unintelligible].  No, seriously, it's a foreign language.  Although I'm sure [unintelligible].

01:29  	01:42  	MALE:  Yeah.  I talked to my roommate who's got Greek composition. He has PhD music major.  And he -- I'll understand him for about 30 seconds and then he goes off and I'm sitting there nodding.  And I'm going I have no idea what you're talking about. 

01:43  	02:06  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Music was another world.  I used to sing -- I sang in an a cappella group in college.  I was just -- [unintelligible] like to sing, I don't know really know anything bout music.  But there are some people who really knew what they were doing.  I figure I must have [unintelligible].  I was like well, go for it.  I won't know the difference.

02:07  	02:14  	MALE:  I've always been a supporter of saying the louder the radio is the better I can sing.  So, totally believe in that.

02:15  	02:16  	FEMALE:  That works.

02:16  	02:27  	MALE:  I love sing, but I've actually been told by my sister before, who sings this song?  And I'll answer and she'll say let's keep it that way [laughter].

02:27  	02:28  	FEMALE:  That's funny.  

02:29  	02:31  	MALE:  That's my sister.  Do you have any siblings?

02:31	02:32	FEMALE:  I have a brother, a younger brother.

02:33	02:33	MALE:  How much younger?

02:35	02:52	FEMALE:  He's three years younger than I am.  But he is -- he travels around the world for a while after college.  And then searched for a job for a little while and now he's working in New York, doing Media Buying.  Which I don't really know what it is, but he gets to go out to fancy dinners a lot and he gets free tickets to all sorts of things.

02:52	02:52	MALE:  Not bad.

02:52	02:54	FEMALE:  It's like I need to visit you.

02:55	02:56	MALE:  Education, media buy

02:56	02:56	FEMALE:  Yeah.

02:57	02:58	MALE:  What do you want to with education?

02:58	03:13	FEMALE:  Um, I actually thought I would like to do research for a couple of years.  [unintelligible] and parts of various [unintelligible].  After that I'm not sure, beyond that PhD, maybe [unintelligible].

03:13  	03:27  	MALE:  I have a really good friend of mine who just finished her PhD in education.  And I helped her proofread her thesis and I learned more about longitudinal studies assessment instruments for elementary school reading levels than I ever wanted to.

03:27  	03:42  	FEMALE:  I couldn't imagine.  That's a very select audience.  I mean, I would be interested in reading it [laughter].  But I can't imagine that someone who's really psyched about building robots would necessarily be thrilled about reading assessments.

03:43  	03:49  	MALE:  It was interesting but I have to read several times before I even understood what she was talking about.  But, I don't know.

03:50 	03:53  	FEMALE:  Well, that's cool that you helped her out.   You're a good friend to do that.

03:54  	04:05  	MALE:  Yeah, well, she's helped me out on a lot of proofing.  I can't write.  I can build something; I can solve math problems.  I can't spell and I can't write [horn].  So.  That way?

04:04  	04:06  	FEMALE:  Okay.  It was nice to meet you.  So yeah, you're going clockwise.  So yeah, that's the way the clock goes right?

04:11  	04:11  	MALE:  Thanks.
