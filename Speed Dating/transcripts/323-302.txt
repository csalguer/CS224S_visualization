0:17 0:17 MALE: Two years now.
0:17 0:17 FEMALE: Just for school?
0:18 0:21 MALE: No, no, no. Actually I'm in post-doc here.
0:21 0:21 FEMALE: Okay.
0:22 0:28 MALE: So I don't need to be a regular student to come here but I'm in the post doc.
0:27 0:30 FEMALE: Oh. So I see.  So are you doing teaching? What do you do?
0:30 0:35 MALE: No, no, no. I do research, which is cool. I don't really like teaching.
0:36 0:36 FEMALE: Okay. So what did you--
0:37 0:37 MALE: Solar physics.
0:39 0:39 FEMALE: Physics?
0:41 0:41 MALE: Yeah. Solar from the sun.
0:41 0:43 FEMALE: Solar physics. Wow. That's exciting.
0:43 0:43 MALE: And you, what are you doing?
0:44 0:48 FEMALE: I'm, uh, finishing my masters in education to be a high school teacher.
0:48 0:48 MALE: Oh. So you go to the school of education.
0:51 0:51 FEMALE: Yes.
0:52 0:53 MALE: There's a lot of people from the school of education.
0:52 0:53 FEMALE: Yeah. They're running the fuddies so...
0:55 0:55 MALE: Okay.
0:57 0:57 FEMALE: I like to support my peers when I can.
0:56 0:57 MALE: What, what?
0:58 1:00 FEMALE: I like to support the school of ed fuddies when I can.
1:00 1:03 MALE: What specific field of education?
1:04 1:05 FEMALE: High school math education.
1:06 1:08 MALE: Okay. So you'll be teaching math.
1:09 1:09 FEMALE: Yes. I plan to teach math.
1:12 1:13 MALE: How long is your program?
1:13 1:15 FEMALE: It's one year so I'll be done in two or three weeks.
1:14 1:19 MALE: Oh. It's not two years for a Masters in the U.S.
1:19 1:31 FEMALE: It is usually two years but this program is four quarters. So it's a calendar year but it's still four quarters. So we started last June. We started June 20th, 2004 so I'll be done June 12th 2005.
1:32 1:35 MALE: Okay. And I guess you have a lot of work compacted?
1:36 1:39 FEMALE: Well, yeah. I teach full time in the day and then I take classes in the afternoons.
1:38 1:40 MALE: Oh. You're already a teacher.
1:41 1:44 FEMALE: Well the teacher I was working with is going on maternity leave so I teach her class.
1:44 1:50 MALE: So it was because you wanted it or it's because it's part of your studies that you have to teach during.
1:50 1:58 FEMALE: Well we teach for the whole year.  And most people only teach one class but I'm teaching three so.
1:58 2:00 MALE: And why did you want to become a teacher?
2:01 2:08 FEMALE: I just think it's an important job. And I really like math and I think that math is very boring and stupid the way it's taught in school.
2:07 2:07 MALE: [laughter]
2:08 2:13 FEMALE: And I'd like to try not teaching in a boring, silly way.
2:14 2:18 MALE: I've been told that you have to keep the face to be a teacher in the U.S.
2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Keep your face?
2:20 2:23 MALE: Yeah. Because the job is difficult and it's not well paid.
2:23 2:35 FEMALE: The job is difficult and it's not well paid.  But it's fun. I mean, I really like being-- I like young people. I think that they're funny; I think schools are amusing places.
2:36 2:39 MALE: And you want to teach-- I mean, you can choose where you want to teach or?
2:41 2:46 FEMALE: Well I have a license to teach in California now. I'm actually going to teach at San Lorenzo High School next year.
2:47 2:47 MALE: Okay.
2:48 2:50 FEMALE: Which is right off 92 on the, uh, east side.
2:51 2:51 MALE: You need a license?
2:52 2:55 FEMALE: You need a license to teach, it's to go along with the credential.
2:54 2:56 MALE: So you can not teach in Nevada for instance?
2:57 3:07 FEMALE: Well some states I can teach in straight away. And some states I have to take another exam. But it is state by state so it's kind of ridiculous.
3:07 3:09 MALE: Yeah. It's like with the lawyers.
3:10 3:20 FEMALE: Right. Exactly. But some states like New York and New Jersey, they honor California license but I still have to take some test that knows I know something about math.
3:21 3:24 MALE: Well yeah. I guess it's the same in Europe.
3:24 3:24 FEMALE: Is it?
3:24 3:31 MALE: Well I mean if you are a teacher in France and you want to teach in Germany, for instance. You have to take classes.
3:32 3:36 FEMALE: At least that's a different country. It would be like you're teaching in Leon and you want to go teach in Paris and it's a new exam. [laughter]
3:36 3:38 MALE: Yeah. Okay. But it's...
3:40 3:40 FEMALE: Geographically condensed?
3:41 3:53 MALE: Yeah. And it's in the European Union so it's getting more and more like the U.S. Even though the big difference that German and French don't speak the same language but otherwise it's...
3:55 3:58 FEMALE: Otherwise it's kind of-- [horn] That always scares me.  
3:58 3:59 MALE: That is fast.
4:00 4:00 FEMALE: That is very fast. 
4:01 4:01 MALE: Nice to meet you.
4:01 4:03 FEMALE: Thank you. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.
