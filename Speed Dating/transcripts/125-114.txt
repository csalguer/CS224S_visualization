04:22  	04:30  	FEMALE:  So I'm hanging around here for the summer at least and then hopefully staying around for longer.  Looking for jobs right now

04:31  	04:32  	FEMALE:  And I'm looking in the area, but we'll see.

04:32  	04:38  	MALE:  Yeah, I see.  Is it difficult to find a job that you know?

04:38  	04:48 	FEMALE:  It depends on what you want to do.  I'm hoping it's not going to be too difficult for me to find a job, but it's so much -- it's all about who you know.  It's all about networking.

04:48  	04:48  	MALE:  Right.  I see.

04:49  	04:51  	FEMALE:  Um, it's just -- its' a pain.

04:52  	04:55  	MALE:  Right, so do you think Stanford is any help in building that sort of thing?

04:56  	05:09  	FEMALE:  Definitely.  It's if you sell -- yeah, I mean my advisor knows everyone, so -- and he's really willing to help people out, send emails, pass my resume along, which  is really, really helpful.

05:10  	05:11  	MALE:  That's very good.  That's good.

05:12  	05:17  	FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm lucky.  So you'll be looking in academia in a couple of years, huh?

05:18  	05:32  	MALE:  Uh, I have no idea to be honest, I prefer not to think about it right now and -- but mostly likely yeah.  At the moment it seems like I'd like to stay in academia, for at least a few more years, after I finish my PhD [horn] and then we'll see.

05:32  	05:37  	FEMALE:  The Masters program for academia jobs and [unintelligible] about jobs.  It was so interesting to hear that.
