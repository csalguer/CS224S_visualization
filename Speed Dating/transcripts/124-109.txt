0:01:00.8 0:01:06.2 MALE:  Oh it was fun.  Uh, something new that I've never tried before.  
0:01:00.9 0:01:03.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  You and me both.  I've never tried this before.  [laughter] 
0:01:09.5 0:01:14.7 MALE:  Uh, so what's your, uh, academic- uh, what's your school in Stanford?
0:01:09.3 0:01:10.3 FEMALE:  The school of education.
0:01:15.8 0:01:16.9 MALE:  The school of education.  
0:01:10.9 0:01:12.0 FEMALE:  Yeah, what about you?
0:01:17.1 0:01:19.7 MALE:  Uh, I'm in electrical engineering. 
0:01:13.9 0:01:14.5 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:20.0 0:01:20.8 MALE:  Second year.  
0:01:15.1 0:01:17.2 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  I met somebody else here that was-
0:01:23.1 0:01:26.8 MALE:  Yeah, there is actually some of these students, but E is such a big department, so.
0:01:21.0 0:01:22.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  How many people?
0:01:28.0 0:01:32.4 MALE:  Uh, I think- I believe [unintelligible] have over two hundred students.
0:01:26.7 0:01:30.6 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  The thing kind of fell down.  [laughter] 
0:01:34.5 0:01:35.9 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:01:31.0 0:01:32.3 FEMALE:  So how many students?
0:01:38.1 0:01:40.6 MALE:  I think at least we have over two hundred.
0:01:34.8 0:01:36.0 FEMALE:  Oh okay.
0:01:41.8 0:01:45.2 MALE:  And maybe more.  Like, I haven't really kept up with the whole department.
0:01:38.2 0:01:40.2 FEMALE:  That's pretty big.
0:01:46.0 0:01:51.0 MALE:  It's a big department.  Uh, and I have met a lot of people, so [unintelligible].
0:01:45.5 0:01:47.7 FEMALE:  Good.  So how long have you been here at Stanford?
0:01:53.1 0:01:55.6 MALE:  Uh, two years.  What about you?
0:01:50.4 0:01:51.8 FEMALE:  I've- this is my 5th year.
0:01:58.1 0:02:02.0 MALE:  I see.  So are you affiliated with any dance clubs at Stanford?
0:01:56.6 0:02:11.1 FEMALE:  Yeah. I'm- dance for a student dance company here.  And, um, I dance with one of the- he- he's a choreographer in San Francisco.  He has a company over there.  But he teaches classes here.  So I'm working with him on an individual project.
0:02:16.9 0:02:20.9 MALE:  You know, that's interesting, you know.  Like I just started into dancing like two months ago.
0:02:15.5 0:02:16.8 FEMALE:  In what type of dance?
0:02:21.7 0:02:22.4 MALE:  Social dancing.
0:02:16.7 0:02:17.3 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:22.9 0:02:32.6 MALE:  Uh, and my friend is both into social dancing and performance dancing.  So I want- she's- uh, she- she's taking a class at Mission College, a jazz dance, which I saw before.  
0:02:27.3 0:02:27.7 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:33.4 0:02:34.9 MALE:  I thought it was quite interesting.  
0:02:29.5 0:02:30.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:35.0 0:02:37.9 MALE:  Uh, but I'm just curious how you say that you're not into social dancing?
0:02:32.7 0:02:33.4 FEMALE:  No.
0:02:38.4 0:02:42.0 MALE:  I thought social dancing was so much more fun than performance dancing, right?
0:02:36.6 0:02:40.9 FEMALE:  Um, I don't- I don't really know.  I just- I- I really don't know why.
0:02:45.3 0:02:46.3 MALE:  Have you ever tried it?
0:02:41.0 0:02:47.1 FEMALE:  I- yeah, I've tried.  I just can't follow.  I guess that's just reflective of like--
0:02:51.3 0:02:52.2 MALE:  Oh I see.
0:02:46.8 0:02:55.3 FEMALE:  --me in life, I'm not a follower.  So, um, I- I just really don't like the concept of doing what somebody else is--
0:03:01.1 0:03:01.8 MALE:  That makes sense.
0:02:56.7 0:02:58.2 FEMALE:  --telling me to do and--
0:03:04.3 0:03:05.3 MALE:  Actually, when I--
0:02:58.1 0:03:00.6 FEMALE:  I- I'm just- step all over their feet.
0:03:05.7 0:03:10.3 MALE:  When I first went to the, uh, the dance club, uh, it's just like a beginner class.
0:03:04.6 0:03:05.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:10.3 0:03:13.7 MALE:  I was surprised that they used the term leader and follower.
0:03:08.5 0:03:09.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:14.1 0:03:20.7 MALE:  I never even- I mean, that's a term that people used for like leadership and everything else.  And I was so surprised that they used that term. 
0:03:15.7 0:03:16.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:21.0 0:03:23.1 MALE:  And apparently, they use it universally--
0:03:17.7 0:03:19.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, oh, they do.  Yeah.
0:03:23.8 0:03:27.6 MALE:  --like, and then as I realized, like in one week afterwards--
0:03:21.2 0:03:21.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:27.7 0:03:28.5 MALE:  That sounds weird.
0:03:22.2 0:03:24.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, so it's not really like a social- 
0:03:29.4 0:03:29.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:24.2 0:03:42.7 FEMALE:  Well I mean, I guess you could say it's kind of like a social term.  I don't know.  But, um, yeah I think it's more for pragmatic reasons so you know exactly what you're doing and what the other person is doing when you're dancing with them.  But yeah, I've- I tried salsa dancing and I mean, I can probably dance well on my own-
0:03:47.7 0:03:48.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:42.5 0:03:45.7 FEMALE:  -salsa dancing.  But with someone else not so much.
0:03:50.5 0:03:54.8 MALE:  Why- why did you practice [unintelligible] become the leader?  You always become the leader, right?
0:03:49.9 0:03:54.7 FEMALE:  I could.  I don't think very many men are comfortable with that. [laughter] 
0:03:59.2 0:03:59.8 [horn]
0:04:00.1 0:04:00.8 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:03:56.4 0:03:59.0 FEMALE:  But, yeah.  Well it was nice meeting you.
0:04:03.9 0:04:04.8 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
0:03:59.0 0:04:00.9 FEMALE:  Good luck with the social dancing.
0:04:05.7 0:04:06.6 MALE:  Oh yeah.  
0:04:01.4 0:04:02.2 FEMALE:  [laughter]
