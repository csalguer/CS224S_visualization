0:01 0:03 MALE:  Okay.  So, I'm male308.

0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  I'm female337, nice to meet you.

0:08 0:12 MALE:  female337, good to meet you.  So, what are you studying?

0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  I study bacteria in the department of developmental [unintelligible].

0:13 0:14 MALE:  That's a great area, yeah, everybody is like, well, biology and I study bac--I like that.

0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  That's what I heard.

0:15 0:17 MALE:  So, I am going to presume you're a Ph.D.?

0:20 0:20 FEMALE:  I am actually done with my Ph.D.  I'm a post doc.

0:20 0:21 MALE:  Holly Molly that's really cool.  How long is your post doc program?

0:22 0:25 FEMALE:  Well, the program is pretty arbitrary.  It's not like a [unintelligible] program that you have [unintelligible].  So--well on average people finish their post doc in three to five years depending on where you want to go.  If you want to become a professor, usually it's longer.  But I'm not--

0:30 0:33 MALE:  This is an opportunity to like a little bit and--

0:34 0:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's just research--focus on research and no--no--no more classes, no more committing [unintelligible].

0:38 0:40 MALE:  Do you teach at all or you're just in the lab?

0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  I'm just in the lab most of the time.

0:41 0:47 MALE:  That's--oh, well hopefully, very cool.  I mean, assuming you're studying something that you like.  And actually it's pretty interesting.

0:47 0:54 FEMALE:  Well, actually, uh, I think, uh--well, I think well I would like to go out a little bit that's why I'm here just meeting people.  Because usually I'm stuck in--on the floor and just get to meet people on the floor so.

0:54 0:56 MALE:  It's got to be a little--a little lonely--

0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:57 0:57 MALE:  --and a little--

0:58 1:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, just like, uh-huh, I like to meet other people outside the field a little bit yeah.

1:01 1:05 MALE:  It is refreshing.  I'm in the law school.  I just finished up my second year, so I'm [unintelligible].

1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  So, one more year to go?

1:06 1:21 MALE:  One more year to go.  It's gone by so quick.  But, I mean, it's the same situation, you know, we've got a big program, but I don't really meet many people outside of it.  And the actual practice is pretty--unless, you're in like, you know, certain areas of practice for the most part you're in your office heads down doing work, you know.

1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  I see.

1:22 1:26 MALE:  So, it's--yeah.  It's one of those things where you need to get a work like balance, I guess, to survive.

1:26 1:37 FEMALE:  Yup.  I guess in grad school I figured out I spent too much time in the lab, so at the post doc I think--I'll consider I'm being a lot lazier than what I--what I used to be.  But just like as you said, I need to balance my life and work a little bit more.

1:38 1:39 MALE:  You totally do.  Where were you for your Ph.D.?

1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  Michigan--University of Michigan.

1:41 1:44 MALE:  How did you like that?  I've never been to Ann Arbor, but people say it's fabulous.

1:45 1:50 FEMALE:  Well, it's a pretty campus, but weather, I don't miss it at all.  That's why I'm here in California.

1:50 1:50 MALE:  Where were you before?

1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  Before, I was in Wisconsin for my under grad.

1:53 1:54 MALE:  Oh, so you're used to that weather.

1:55 1:56 FEMALE:  But before that I was in Hong Kong.  I grew up in Hong Kong.

1:56 1:58 MALE:  Well, that must have been great.  I've never been to Hong Kong.

1:58 2:07 FEMALE:  It was quite a big shock, yeah, so, like, snow--the first--the first snow I was pretty excited like the very first time I saw snow [unintelligible] I called my mom and said, mom it's snowing.  But after a few days, it's like, oh no this is not for me.

2:07 2:09 MALE:  This is not going to go away any time--this is not a novelty.

2:10 2:14 FEMALE:  No, so, yeah, and I'm pretty sick of the West that's why I moved to California.

2:14 2:17 MALE:  Really good out here.  Dodo you make a bad [unintelligible]?  Is your family still over there?

2:17 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, my--my mom and my sister now live back in Hong Kong.  So, usually I go home once a year.

2:22 2:26 MALE:  That must be tough on you.  I mean, I don't know, I mean, you sound like you're close to your family and so.

2:25 2:28 FEMALE:  I am--I am--I'm--I'm--yeah, I'm okay with it, so they come over a lot.

2:28 2:29 MALE:  Oh, that's really nice.

2:28 2:33 FEMALE:  My sister used to live in Sacramento for a long time.  She went there for school and then for--she just moved back because her boyfriend lives there.

2:34 2:38 MALE:  Darn good reason.  Yeah, well, and this is the great aspect about living in the Bay Area people want to come visit you.  

2:39 2:39 FEMALE:  That's true.  

2:39 2:42 MALE:  I grew up in--in Tennessee, which is like nobody would want to go see you there so.

2:43 2:48 FEMALE:  It's not like a transit area.  Because in California people are like in and out of the country, so I'll be stopping by San Francisco for a day--

2:48 2:48 MALE:  Perfect.

2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  --would you like to come and [unintelligible].

2:50 2:53 MALE:  No one stops by Memphis?  And if they were going to, I'd advise them against it.  [laughter].

2:53 3:00 FEMALE:  And Michigan.  It's like nobody--I was in Michigan for six years, my best friend never came up and visited me.  Usually I go up to visit her in Toronto.  She's like I'm not coming down, there's nothing there.

3:00 3:03 MALE:  That's absurd, although I have heard Toronto is a great city.

3:04 3:10 FEMALE:  I love going there just because I miss food 'cause I--I love Asian food and there's not great Asian food in Michigan.

3:11 3:13 MALE:  I am not terribly surprised to hear that.

3:13 3:18 FEMALE:  So, I'll show up there for the weekend just to hang out with my best friend and just have [unintelligible] ate, and ate, and ate.

3:18 3:21 MALE:  What are your--what's your favorite restaurant around here in that sort of broad Asian jondra [phonetic]?

3:22 3:25 FEMALE:  Asian, like for Cantonese I'll say the one in Milpitas, ABC.  

3:25 3:26 MALE:  Never been there.  Hmm.

3:27 3:30 FEMALE:  It's a pretty good Chinese restaurant, but I just like so many good restaurants [unintelligible].

3:30 3:37 MALE:  I will now look that up.  That's a really recommendation.  Do you ever think about going back like either--like Hong Kong or Mainland China?

3:37 3:52 FEMALE:  Well--not Mainland China for sure.  It will be either Hong Kong or just stay here because I--I--I do--I do like it here and that's why I'm--I'm going to--I'm looking for a job right now, so I think--I'll transfer [unintelligible] here first and I might move back.  I never rule out that possibility, but it's not on the top, top of my list right now.

3:53 3:54 MALE:  What's it's like when--I'm sorry.  

3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  No. 

3:55 3:58 MALE:  What's it like when you interview for a job do you have to give a sample lecture and they ask you about your research?

3:58 4:03 FEMALE:  Usually I think you have to it depends on like if you work for a research scientist you definitely have to give it like an hour talk.  But--

4:03 4:05 MALE:  It's a daunting interview my goodness.

4:05 4:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's long.  It's a whole day.  It's a whole day process.  Well, nice to meet you [unintelligible].

4:09 4:10 MALE:  It was really nice to meet you, female337.

4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  Good luck.

4:12 4:13 MALE:  Thank you.  You too.  

4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  I'm Station Q.
