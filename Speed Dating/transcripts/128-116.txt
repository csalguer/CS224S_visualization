FILE NAME: Male Speaker 116 -- Female Speaker 128

0:00 0:01 MALE:  Just one second.  I'm so--
0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Take your time.  [background conversation]
0:13 0:15 MALE:  So, how is this going? 
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  It's going all right.  How about for you?
0:18 0:19 MALE:  I'm pretty tired to be honest.
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  I know, I'm starting to get a little bleary-eyed.  
0:21 0:27 MALE:  I didn't sleep well last night, so I'm just like kind of--I'm not like dosing off but I'm not like very energetic.  
0:29 0:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, I [unintelligible] like, yeah, hearing myself say the same things over, and over, and over again. 
0:34 0:38 MALE:  Programmed, and you've been having this conversation with people too?  
0:38 0:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:39 0:39 MALE:  How is it going?  
0:40 0:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's [unintelligible] just conversating [unintelligible].  We're getting into new territory here.  
0:45 0:47 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  So, the obligatory question--what program are you in?
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  I'm in geophysics.  What about yourself?
0:50 0:52 MALE:  I don't think I've ever met anyone in geophysics.
0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  Really?  I mean there's not a lot.  
0:54 0:54 MALE:  How many?
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  Our department--well, there's 60 people. 
0:57 0:57 MALE:  Total?
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Yeah.
0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  PhD.
1:00 1:07 MALE:  Okay, yeah, all right, I'm in poli sci, which is roughly the same size.  There are about 10 of us entering and maybe 80 people total.  
1:07 1:08 FEMALE:  PhD or Masters?
1:08 1:12 MALE:  Yeah, there's no Master's.  I mean I guess you could get one if you leave. 
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:13 1:16 MALE:  But it's not like a very good career move to get a Masters. 
1:18 1:20 FEMALE:  So, what kind of stuff do you study?
1:20 1:29 MALE:  So, I'm a first-year, so I'm pretty broad.  I mean you're taking classes and kind of thinking about stuff.  I mean I'm interesting in American politics.
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:30 1:34 MALE:  Hopefully, I'll get more specified.  How about you?  What year are you? 
1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  I'm in my second year.
1:35 1:39 MALE:  Okay, and so do you hang around here for the summer and do research?
1:39 1:39 FEMALE:  Yes, I do.  
1:40 1:40 MALE:  Okay.  
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  What about you?
1:41 1:43 MALE:  I'm going to go to D.C. and do some work.  
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Okay, [unintelligible].
1:44 1:56 MALE:  They're pretty--one nice thing about Stanford is they'll give you money for the summer regardless of what you do even if you just like sit on your ass, which is nice.  A lot of places don't.  They make you work for it.  
1:56 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, they don't in all departments.  
2:00 2:00 MALE:  No?
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Some departments [unintelligible]. 
2:02 2:02 MALE:  Interesting.  
2:03 2:06 FEMALE:  I don't think [unintelligible].  
2:07 2:07 MALE:  Okay.  
2:08 2:10 FEMALE:  I guess here [unintelligible].
2:10 2:15 MALE: Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.  I thought they'd make us work for it.  So, you know. 
2:16 2:18 FEMALE:  So, what did you get [unintelligible]?
2:18 2:26 MALE:  I was in New Zealand last year traveling and researching, and before that I worked for a Senator.  And then I worked at the Democratic National Committee.  
2:26 2:30 FEMALE: Okay, what were you doing in New Zealand?  What kind of research were you doing?
2:31 2:38 MALE:  They have like a different electoral system than we do.  It allows small parties to come in.  So, they have seven parties in their parliament.  
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:39 3:01 MALE:  So, I was kind of doing very qualitative, very soft research on how small parties within government operate like a big party in government.  So, I was mostly talking to people and reading news accounts and stuff.  It was good.  I loved it.  It's a great country.  I mean the only bad part is it's expensive to fly there.  It's $2,000.  
3:01 3:02 FEMALE: Yeah, hard to get there.  
3:02 3:06 MALE:  But other than that it was really nice.  I mean clean.  It's great.  
3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible].  
3:08 3:21 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, although they're tired of those jokes.  I'll warn you of that.  They say that they used to have 70,000 [unintelligible], and now they're down to 60 million.  And they used to have 3 million people, and now they have 4 million.  So, the ratio is--
3:22 3:23 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
3:23 3:25 MALE:  Yeah, I guess they have a lot more cattle now.  
3:27 3:27 FEMALE:  Whereabouts are you from?
3:28 3:29 MALE:  Illinois.  
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Illinois?  Okay.  
3:30 3:30 MALE:  How about you?  
3:31 3:32 FEMALE:  I'm from Canada.
3:33 3:35 MALE:  Whereabouts, that's what I was wondering, yeah.  
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  Do I have a Canadian accent?  
3:37 3:40 MALE:  Not--I didn't think you did, but--
3:40 3:45 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
3:45 3:48 MALE:  About, [unintelligible].  What part of Canada?
3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  I'm from Vancouver. 
3:51 3:54 MALE:  I've heard that's a beautiful, beautiful--I'm sure you've been to Whistler.  
3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
3:54 3:54 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:55 3:56 FEMALE:  I've done a lot of skiing up there.  
3:56 3:58 MALE:  I heard it was a bad season, but I'm going to go next year.
