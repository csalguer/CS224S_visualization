3:04 3:16 MALE: Yes more or less I actually--just another year, um a last year of study but it's a bit different now, I will be in the industry to, for my last year.

3:16 3:19 FEMALE: Okay.  Are you excited about that?

3:19 3:20 MALE: Excuse me?

3:20 3:21 FEMALE: Are you excited about that?

3:29 3:30 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:30 3:32 MALE: So uh it's, it's a good moment I think.

3:35 3:44 FEMALE: That's cool.  Yeah.  I've got--I'm in a PhD program, so I've got another at least three, maybe four years before I'm done, so.

3:44 3:45 MALE: Ah yes, very long one.

3:46 3:47 FEMALE: I just started, yeah.

3:47 3:48 MALE: And do you like it?

3:48 3:52 FEMALE: Yeah.  I like California.  I'd been living in Washington, in DC.

3:52 3:53 MALE: Oh yeah.

3:52 3:53 FEMALE: Before coming here.

3:53 3:54 MALE: Okay.    

3:53 4:19 FEMALE: And I was there for about three years, which I liked but people were very uptight, so I kind of enjoy that people know how to relax in California.  Um and I was sort of--I, you know, intentionally came back to school, so I had taken some time off in between finishing my undergraduate degree before I came back for my graduate degree.  So.  So I like it.  It's pretty.  So.  Do you like the people in the college of engineering?

4:20 4:24  MALE: Um, yes 'cause the people in my lab are really uh nice with me.

4:24 4:27 FEMALE: Okay.  What does your lab do?

4:28 4:34 MALE: Uh I'm studying um shariology [phonetic].  Uh I think you won't know what it means.

4:51 4:52 FEMALE: Okay.  

4:52 5:01 MALE: And she provide me to um, two subjects of internship in the chemical engineering department, so I didn't really know what it was.

5:01 5:02 FEMALE: Okay.  [horn]
