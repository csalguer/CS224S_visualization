0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female134.

0:05 0:06 MALE:  female134, nice to meet you.

0:07 0:09 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you too.  Yeah I see they got your name wrong.

0:09 0:15 MALE:  Well they--they put down my most--my, uh, name is male102 but most people just call me male102 so.

0:15 0:15 FEMALE:  Right.  

0:17 0:17 MALE:  So what program are you in?

0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Uh, I'm in law school.  What about you?

0:20 0:21 MALE:  Uh, in the ed school, uh--

0:22 0:22 FEMALE:  Oh, really?

0:22 0:24 MALE:  Yeah, a second year doctoral student in philosophy of ed.

0:25 0:27 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:26 0:27 MALE:  Oh really.

0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] yeah, I [unintelligible] 

0:30 0:30 MALE:  Cool.

0:31 0:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:31 0:32 MALE:  How did you like it?

0:32 0:36 FEMALE:  Oh, I loved it.  I [unintelligible] yeah.

0:36 0:39 MALE:  What--what decided to make you got into law--

0:39 0:54 FEMALE:  It was really hard because [unintelligible] I mean my, um, [unintelligible] education like my curriculum [unintelligible] and it was really [unintelligible] parameters [unintelligible] so like really expressive, um, and I'd meet the kids [unintelligible] 

0:54 0:54 MALE:  Yeah.

0:54 0:59 FEMALE:  --[unintelligible] I thought about getting [unintelligible] 

0:59 0:59 MALE:  Uh-huh.

0:59 1:05 FEMALE:  But [unintelligible].  Like what's your focus [unintelligible] 

1:05 1:35 MALE:  I, uh, I actually do more like the philosophy of education research.  So I study, uh, I study how people study education.  I think about, uh, how different disciplines like economics and sociology or psychology, um, uh, have a certain disciplinary lens, how compatible those different disciplinary lenses are to understanding education.  And in particular how the roles of values and beliefs and politics affect research and education in particular.

1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  Cool.

1:36 1:46 MALE:  And--and also I guess, uh, to some extent how, uh, how research, uh, is used or not used in making politics.  [unintelligible] 

1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Okay.  And what are you finding in--

1:49 2:06 MALE:  Uh, well I'm--I'm at the point where I'm trying to think about, uh, I'm trying to understand science enough to be able to say, uh, in what ways, uh, scientific theories can have room for those sorts of value judgments and what ways they sort of rule them out.  So to what--

2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:07 2:33 MALE:  --objectivity and subjectivity in science is--is one aspect of it.  Some, I mean you see some very obvious things just looking around.  You know there are--there are faculty in the school of ed who have clear sort of--they're--they're advocates of teacher preparation and they--they feel like all teachers need to go through a--a four or a five year training program to be certified.  And as it happens, all the research they do confirms that finding.  So they're sort of issues there--

2:32 2:33 FEMALE:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.

2:33 2:34 MALE:  --about how scientific that is if--

2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  Right.

2:35 2:38 MALE:  --if you can have everything you do ends up just confirming sort of the--

2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  What you already believe.

2:38 2:39 MALE:  --hypothesis you already believe.

2:40 2:48 FEMALE:  Right.  You're [unintelligible] happen anyway, like [unintelligible] 

2:49 2:58 MALE:  Well you--you have to look at, uh, how you frame something scientifically.  One way--one of the distinguishing features of science is to frame it in such a way that it could be falsified.  That you could--

2:58 2:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:59 2:59 MALE:  --disprove it.

2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:00 3:14 MALE:  And to the extent that you're--you're presenting research that--that doesn't do that, uh, and isn't presented in that sort of way, uh, or that sort of misrepresents things or doesn't really take a--a full account of all of the different issues, um, that's--that's problematic.

3:15 3:15 FEMALE:  Okay.

3:15 3:22 MALE:  So part of it is looking at what the standards for good research would be that would help to, uh, mitigate those--

3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  Right.

3:22 3:36 MALE:  --issues.  Um, but there's also legitimate ways in which values can--can shape things.  But a lot of times you get the feeling that people are just talking past each other.  And sometimes they're talking past each other because they have different values, sometimes they're talking past each other because they're talking from totally different [unintelligible] so--

3:36 3:39 FEMALE:  Okay.  Interesting.  No, it was really interesting.

3:40 3:44 MALE:  Yeah.  Sure, that's [unintelligible] how law school is going, but--

3:45 3:48 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] some of my friends are here.  You can ask them.

3:48 3:50 MALE:  [laughter]  All right.  Have fun.
