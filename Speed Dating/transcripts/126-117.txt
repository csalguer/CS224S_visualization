00:01  	00:01  	MALE:  [horn]

00:03  	00:04  	FEMALE:  Oh.

00:05  	00:05  	MALE:  Hey.  I'm male117.

00:06  	00:06  	FEMALE:  female126.

00:07  	00:07  	MALE:  female126, nice to meet you.

00:08  	00:17  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] feel very like my legs are just sticking out too far.  I feel like I'm sideways, I'm going to try and face you.

00:17  	00:19  	MALE:  [laughter] Okay or I could just turn.

00:20  	00:29  	FEMALE:  So, [unintelligible] I just really think I'm kicking people so --.  How are you doing tonight?

00:30  	00:31  	MALE:  Doing well pretty well.  How about you?

00:31 	00:34  	FEMALE:  Getting warmed up.  Date number nine I'm [unintelligible].

00:36  	00:39  	MALE:  Yeah I think there's probably a point where you become a pro and then you start to get like a bit too much.

00:40  	00:57  	FEMALE:  And you see I did the [unintelligible] keeping the right point.  So, what do you think the date is the right place to [unintelligible] at the last one?  Because then how do I know it's the next guys down and not the one I want to [unintelligible]. 

00:57  	01:00  	MALE:  Right [laughter].

01:00  	01:01  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] training involved.

01:01  	01:02  	MALE:  I don't know I'm not sure.

01:03  	01:11  	FEMALE:  Its an interesting combination of sprinting and endurance sprint for the four minutes and then you've got to keep the spring going for like two hours.

01:11  	01:13  	MALE:  Yeah I was -- I was a sprinter, so.  That's it for me.

01:14  	01:21  	FEMALE:  I was like barely a sprinter.  I did pole vaulting.  I mean how much running is that eight feet.  

01:22  	01:22  	MALE:  Yeah. 

01:23  	01:29  	FEMALE:  Yeah, I did long jump to pole jump but not intense speeds.  I did the 100 hurdles. 

01:30	01:30	MALE: Okay.

01:31	01:41	FEMALE:  And like I thought that was a long run, 100 meters.  And so I was really upset when they -- the coaches their rule was you do the even we tell you.  And there were other girls who did the 300 hurdles [unintelligible] --

01:42  	01:43  	MALE:  [unintelligible] that is the worst event.

01:44  	01:48  	FEMALE:  Well, I know I can crawl under the hurdles faster than I cold run on [unintelligible].

01:48  	01:53  	MALE:   Especially at the end, it's so funny to watch people get over that last one bar and they're so tired.  Like wobbling. 

01:53  	01:55  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So what else did you do?

01:55 	01:59  	MALE:  I did the 100, 200, long jump and stuff. 

01:59  	02:01  	FEMALE:  All the fast ones.

02:01  	02:04  	MALE:  Basic sprints, you know.  As short as possible.

02:05  	02:11  	FEMALE:  Yeah, but you really don't get the feel of [unintelligible]. 

02:13  	02:15  	MALE:  Yeah.  It's kind of sad [unintelligible].

02:15  	02:22  	FEMALE:  I think [unintelligible] be a great shot putter, discus thrower and I was terrible.

02:22  	02:32  	MALE:  Oh really.  Its technique, you just got that technique down.  [unintelligible] people are really strong that just couldn't do it and then other people small and [unintelligible].

02:33  	02:36  	FEMALE:  And basically I was stubborn which is why I was reasonable at pool vaulting.

02:36  	02:42  	MALE:  Yeah.  Well, so where did you grow up?

02:42  	02:43  	FEMALE:  I grew up near Poughkeepsie, New York.  

02:44  	02:46  	MALE:  Poughkeepsie?

02:46  	02:46  	FEMALE:  It's a little north of New York City.

02:47  	02:47  	MALE:  Okay.

02:47  	02:55  	FEMALE:  I say that and it's like an hour or so away.  But in the grand scheme of things, it's not Buffalo or Albany and certainly [unintelligible].

02:55  	02:58  	MALE:  And why did you come out here?

02:59  	03:06  	FEMALE:  Well, I have to admit I strongly disliked California before I came here.  But I absolutely came to Stanford for the academics.

03:07  	03:08  	MALE:  Disliked California, why?

03:09  	03:25  	FEMALE:  A large part of it was bitterness because I moved in high school.  Not a good time to move for a girl.  And I feel like the kids in the military because they move a lot, they're sort of -- their a little unhappy.  But one move in high school I was so unhappy.

03:26  	03:27  	MALE:  I see.  Why did you have to move?

03:27  	03:32  	FEMALE:  My dad's job moved us out here.  And I feel like if I had moved at a younger age or my parents had moved after I graduated from high school I would have no problems with California.  But high school, it's the worse time to move.

03:33  	03:34 	MALE:  Yeah that is a bad time.

03:35	03:48	FEMALE:  And watch, I'm not going to be able to avoid it, I'm going to move my kids all when they're in high school and they'll all hate me and hate where we move, so.

03:48	03:49	MALE:  You better learn from that.

03:49  	03:50  	FEMALE:  So where did you grow up?

03:51  	03:56  	MALE:  Ah the Chicago area.  Yeah, I went to the University if Illinois.  So wait where did you go as an undergrad, where did you go?

03:56  	03:58  	FEMALE:  University of Virginia.

03:58  	03:59  	MALE:  So then you went out -- [horn]

04:00  	04:02  	FEMALE:  Oh, I got out of California as soon as I could.

04:03  	04:04  	MALE:  Right.  Just far away as possible.

04:05  	04:05  	FEMALE:  You didn't leave too far. 

04:06  	04:07  	MALE:  No.  Well good to meet you.

04:08  	04:09  	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
