0:14 0:14 MALE:  Oh, you do?
0:15 0:18 FEMALE:  I don't really know their names right now though, but I know I know in Step.  I know two people in Step.
0:18 0:18 MALE:  From this year?
0:19 0:30 FEMALE:  From this year.  Uh one was my--my friends roommate April.  And then some other person is stuck [phonetic].  I don't remember the second person.  But anyways, how do you like it?
0:31 0:34 MALE:  I really like it.  I feel like I'm learning a lot, and I feel like I'm in uh--
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  [interposing] I know, nameX nameX.
0:36 0:37 MALE:  Oh, nameX nameX--nameX R., yup.  That's great.
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Okay, cool.
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Yeah.
0:39 0:41 FEMALE:  I was who do I know that's a teacher.  Okay.  Cool.
0:42 0:43 MALE:  Do you live right in those--you must live right there then.
0:43 0:46 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.  I live right next to that, so.  Yeah, so that's how I know them.
0:46 0:46 MALE:  Cool.
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  You?
0:49 0:50 MALE:  They're in [unintelligible] for second.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  No, no, no.  Do you live around there?
0:52 0:57 MALE:  Oh, no, no, no.  I--I live uh--I used to live in Raines, but now I live in UV, which is like--I live right behind there in GCB [phonetic].
0:57 0:59 FEMALE:  Oh, so you're here for longer than a year?
0:59 1:02 MALE:  No, I--that's the summer.  See, I moved in and--
1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  [interposing] Summer?
1:02 1:04 MALE:  Yeah, they gave me a summer assignment--
1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
1:04 1:04 MALE: --and then they switched me. 
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  They do switch.
1:05 1:07 MALE:  And then--'cause they switched all the addresses, too.
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:07 1:10 MALE:  So one of the things I was looking forward to when I was coming here so I'll be in the same place for a year.
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, I know you were.
1:11 1:15 MALE:  I don't have to deal with that stuff.  I had three addresses the first five months that I was there.
1:14 1:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
1:16 1:16 MALE:  It was ridiculous.  I was so bummed.
1:17 1:19 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  What are you going to do when you graduate?
1:19 1:21 MALE:  I'm going to have a job lined up for next year teaching in the city.
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Here?
1:22 1:22 MALE:  Yeah, teaching in uh San Francisco.
1:23 1:25 FEMALE:  In the city?  Awesome.  What's the city--or what's the--the school?
1:26 1:34 MALE:  It's um--it's a charter school.  It's called Excel Academy.  It's like it will be in the third year next year [unintelligible].  It's cool.  It's really--I'm really excited about it.  Like their mission is environmental leadership and the--they really--
1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  [interposing] Really?
1:35 1:38 MALE:  Yeah, like it's bringing these kind of philosophies to urban kids, and it's green.
1:39 1:39 FEMALE:  Wow.
1:40 1:40 MALE:  It's a small public school.
1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  Do they do the garden thing?
1:42 1:43 MALE:  They don't have anything set up.
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  What grade are these people?
1:44 1:44 MALE:  They're high school.
1:45 1:45 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:45 1:50 MALE:  But they're going to be--because they move around, too.  They've been in three different sites in those three years.
1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:51 1:51 MALE:  So it's kind of final.
1:52 1:54 FEMALE:  Tell me, how are they different from regular school?  What's environmental mean?
1:55 1:56 MALE:  Um well it's different--at charter schools are--
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah, they're--they're okay.
1:57 1:59 MALE:  --small public schools where kids apply to, right, and so it's really small.
1:59 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
2:00 2:13 MALE:  And then what they do--they have a couple of different things.  Like one, they have like an intersession section in January where kids go out and do like um one group did like a week-long backpacking trip.  One week they like--one group did like a college exploration trip. 
2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:13 2:15 MALE:  And one did driver's ed.  So they have like some extra things.
2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:16 2:32 MALE:  And they--they have--they just try to focus a lot of their classes on um community resources, I mean like environmental justice issues, right.  A lot of these kids come from really poor neighborhoods where there's like asthma problems, and it's like what--why is there a higher rate of asthma in urban population?  Where does that come from?
2:32 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:33 2:34 MALE:  And why does it happen among poor minority people?
2:35 2:36 FEMALE:  Oh.  That's interesting.
2:36 2:37 MALE:  And a lot of their stuff is kind of coming from there.
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  That's kind of cool.
2:38 2:41 MALE:  Yeah, it's really cool.  So what about you?  What do you do these days?
2:41 2:42 FEMALE:  I'm a product design student.
2:42 2:43 MALE:  Product design, nice.
2:43 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So I make things.
2:45 2:45 MALE:  So you make things.
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Very much.
2:46 2:46 MALE:  Oh.
2:46 2:49 FEMALE:  I am currently a seamstress, a glorified seamstress.  I make skirts.
2:50 2:50 MALE:  You make skirts.
2:50 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's my current job.
2:52 2:52 MALE:  Oh, great.  So--
2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  [interposing] For the next five weeks.
2:54 2:56 MALE:  --you--but you're designing them, so it's not just like you're cut them out and--
2:56 3:00 FEMALE:  [interposing] No.  Yeah, I'm making--I'm designing and I'm making them.  So I'm doing a lot of sewing.
3:00 3:01 MALE:  Is that a masters program or?
3:01 3:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's a masters program.  It's a two-year program.  I'm in my second year, but I am actually going to stick around next year for a couple more classes 'cause I don't really want to work yet 'cause I'm a lazy bum.
3:09 3:10 MALE:  [laughter].
3:10 3:13 FEMALE:  And so I will work part time and go to school part time next year.
3:14 3:14 MALE:  Oh, great.  
3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So it will be pretty cool.
3:17 3:18 MALE:  Yeah, that will be really fun.
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Where you from originally?
3:20 3:20 MALE:  Uh I grew up in Portland, Oregon.
3:21 3:22 FEMALE:  Oh.  How is Oregon?
3:23 3:23 MALE:  I love it.
3:23 3:25 FEMALE:  Yeah?  How's the city Portland like?
3:25 3:26 MALE:  It's--Portland's great.  Like it's--
3:26 3:26 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah?
3:27 3:34 MALE:  Yeah.  It's got like a--it's a really laid back town.  It's really friendly.  Everyone you meet there is really great.  It's only like an hour and-a-half from the coast.  It's an hour and-a-half from the mountains.  
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:34 3:39 MALE:  It's like--it's got lots of good [unintelligible].  It's got awesome music.  It's, you know--I really liked it at the time.
3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:44 3:45 MALE:  So I'm going to stay around here.

3:50 3:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'd always like to visit.  I didn't know if it's like a--is it like a city city or is it kind of just like a very large town?
3:56 3:57 MALE:  It's a pretty big city.
3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  It's a pretty big city?
