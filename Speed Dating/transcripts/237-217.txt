02:49  02:50	FEMALE:  Do you want to stay in the U.S. or?
02:51  03:29	MALE:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, I mean like, yeah definitely because of the job, right?  It involves -- it's like you know like Mexico doesn't have like a big aerospace industry.  So there is no income compared to what the U.S. has right?  So the best way is to stick around and--.  And I like it here.  I don't feel like I'm in a foreign country at all.  I really click into the culture.  I've made tons of friends, American friends form all over the place.  I'm I like -- I get along really well with the American people.  You know I don't feel -- I don't have that culture shock like [unintelligible] people feel like awkward or out of place.  No way.

03:39  03:39	FEMALE:  Really?
03:40  03:49	MALE:  Yeah.  I started as a dishwasher.  I washed dishes, I cleaned floors, I cleaned tables.  I became a waiter and I became a bartender in this restaurant in San Francisco.
03:50  03:51	FEMALE:  So you were in San Francisco [unintelligible].
03:52  04:05	MALE:  Before -- I came here -- I worked there because the restaurant belongs to a relative of my mom.  So they kind of give me job.  And I was working kind of like under the table, you know you're not supposed to tell anyone you included.
04:05  04:06	FEMALE:  Oh, see I don't feel sorry for you now [laughter].
04:06  04:26	MALE:  I studied there for one year and at the end of my stay I worked at a start up company [unintelligible] that was really cool.  Yeah, I would say I had a great time [unintelligible] coming here.  The only thing is that company went into bankruptcy.
04:27  04:28	FEMALE:  Oh [laughter] that's really good.
04:29  04:31	MALE:  I hope [unintelligible] go into bankruptcy.
