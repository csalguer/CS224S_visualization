0:01 0:03 MALE: Alright.  female332, I'm male315.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:05 0:09 MALE: Pleasure to meet you.  Um, why don't you tell me a little bit about you and then I'll tell you about me.
0:10 0:12 FEMALE: That seems a little bit scripted.  [laughter]
0:12 0:15 MALE: [laughter] Well, I hate to tell you, at this stage in the game--
0:15 0:16 FEMALE: You don't have anything else.
0:16 0:17 MALE: I don't have anything else.  [laughter]
0:19 0:22 FEMALE: [laughter]  No, it gets really easy to like, get into the pattern, doesn't it?
0:22 0:22 MALE: That's right.  
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:23 0:29 MALE: Well, I- I've learned more about myself tonight than I have, you know, in a long time, so you'll get the best of what there is to say. 
0:29 0:31 FEMALE: Oh.  So, what have you learned about yourself?
0:31 0:38 MALE: Well, no-no-no-no-no, I- I admire your attempts to steer this in your direction, but um that's very good for assertive, but I asked you about you first.
0:40 0:41 FEMALE: That's a bit aggressive, even.
0:42 0:44 MALE: Well, I've been accused of that before.
0:44 0:47 FEMALE: I see.  So what do you want to know about?
0:48 0:54 MALE: So, I'd like to know where you went to school, where you're from, what you do now, what you do at Stanford, what your interests are, and uh, and then we'll go for me.
0:55 0:57 FEMALE: That's quite a biography.  Um, I grew up in Oregon.
0:58 0:58 MALE: Whereabouts?
0:59 0:59 FEMALE: Corvalis.
1:00 1:03 MALE: Okay.  My great-great grandfather founded Bend, Oregon, so--
1:03 1:04 FEMALE: You're kidding.
1:04 1:05 MALE: I'm sort of a celebrity up there.
1:07 1:08 FEMALE: Are you ... serious?
1:08 1:12 MALE: Yeah, they- they have tickertape parades for me when I go up.  I'm kind of a legend in the area.
1:15 1:15 FEMALE: Sure.
1:15 1:21 MALE: It's true.  Next time we have a male315 Stats [phonetic] day in Bend, I will invite you down.
1:22 1:24 FEMALE: [laughter]  Alright.  Yeah, let me know.
1:24 1:34 MALE: You can sit up, you can sit up on the bandstand with me.  It's great to get the high school marching band out there, and then the big old Cadillacs, you know, with the mayor and everything. It's great.
1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Everyone waves.
1:36 1:43 MALE: Everyone waves.  [laughter]  So, okay, Corvalis, I don't-- I feel like I'm distracting you here, and I'm keeping you from your main mission.
1:43 1:44 FEMALE: Oh, no, but I'm on a mission here.
1:44 1:44 MALE: Right.  
1:45 1:47 FEMALE: Um, went to college at the University of Chicago.  
1:48 1:51 MALE: And, and so the University of Chicago, in what subject, may I ask?
1:52 1:52 FEMALE: Math.
1:53 1:58 MALE: Math.  Sort of like econ, so you're probably very free markets and very like hardcore numbers and everything can be--
1:58 2:00 FEMALE: I'm pretty anti-free market, actually.
2:00 2:03 MALE: Oh really?  Well, you've come to the right school, let me tell you.
2:03 2:04 FEMALE: [laughter]  
2:04 2:09 MALE: [laughter]  Alright?  Okay, so, we got you to Chicago, now--
2:09 2:09 FEMALE: Right.
2:10 2:10 MALE: What's the big leap? 
2:11 2:12 FEMALE: What big leap?
2:12 2:13 MALE: To California.
2:14 2:17 FEMALE: To California, but you're not asking about the leap from Oregon to Chicago.  
2:17 2:20 MALE: Well, we kind of like did that already.  
2:20 2:21 FEMALE: Oh, did we?  
2:21 2:27 MALE: I presumed-- what about Chicago attracted you, and so that you flew away from Oregon?
2:28 2:30 FEMALE: It was different.  Go to the big city.
2:31 2:33 MALE: 'Cause a lot of other places are similar to Oregon.
2:34 2:35 FEMALE: Well, I mean--
2:35 2:37 MALE: Alright, no, I'm giving you too hard of a time.
2:37 2:40 FEMALE: A small, I grew up in a small college town, Chicago is not a small college town.
2:40 2:48 MALE: No, it's not.  No, it's not.  So you went in and did your mathematics work at the University of Chicago.  Any particular emphasis?
2:50 2:53 FEMALE: I double majored in physics, if you could call that-- 
2:53 2:53 MALE: There you go.
2:54 2:54 FEMALE: --emphasis.  
2:55 2:56 MALE: So what's your favorite distribution?
2:58 3:02 FEMALE: Favorite distribution.  I like the coissant [phonetic].
3:03 3:08 MALE: Yes.  Which is very apt for this sort of-- this arrivals process, isn't it?
3:08 3:13 FEMALE: [laughter] Except that you have a pretty rigid time that you're expected to get here.
3:14 3:28 MALE: I know, but it has a certain [unintelligible] of zero, it's true.  [laughter]  Well, okay, it's okay.  Uh, so, uh so statistics and- and math.  And then you're in what department out here at Stanford?
3:28 3:28 FEMALE: Biology.
3:29 3:30 MALE: That's so logical!
3:31 3:31 FEMALE: Is it?  
3:32 3:35 MALE: Uh, is it statistics that you like biology, or what's the um-- ?
3:36 3:37 FEMALE: Um--
3:37 3:39 MALE: Or are you teaching monkeys like math or something, or--?
3:39 3:48 FEMALE: [laughter]  No, um, I'm just really excited about how living organisms interact.  [horn]  Um, and the math is a bit tangential to that.  
3:49 3:51 MALE: I can understand that.  Do you get to use it at all?
3:51 3:52 FEMALE: Oh, absolutely.
3:52 3:54 MALE: Oh, that's good.  Well, female332, it was a pleasure meeting you.
3:55 3:56 FEMALE: Didn't get to find out anything about you.
3:56 3:58 MALE: Well, that's because you- you dilly-dallied basically.
3:59 4:00 FEMALE: Wasting time.
4:02 4:02 MALE: Maybe next time.
