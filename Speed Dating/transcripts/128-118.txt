0:02 0:04 MALE:  Hi.  [laughter] 
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  How are you?
0:05 0:07 MALE:  I'm doing well.  How are you doing?
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  I'm female128.
0:08 0:09 MALE:  My name is male118.  
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:12 0:16 MALE:  Nice to meet you too.  So, what, uh, what's your major here at Stanford?
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  I'm a geophysicist.
0:18 0:20 MALE:  Geophysicist, wow.
0:24 0:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, how about you?
0:22 0:26 MALE:  I am in aeronautics and astronauting in the engineering department, yeah.
0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  Yeah?
0:26 0:26 MALE:  Yeah.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  How is that going for you?
0:28 0:34 MALE:  It's going.  I don't know.  I did it in undergrad and came straight here, so...
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  Where was that at?
0:36 0:50 MALE:  Perdue University in Indiana.  It's like two hours away from [unintelligible], from my hometown, which is in Illinois, outside of Chicago.  So, it was convenient, a good engineering school.  So, it worked for me.  What about you.  
0:54 0:57 FEMALE:  Uhm, I went to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
0:54 0:56 MALE:  Oh, wow.  Is that where you grew up?
1:00 1:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  In fact, people ask me [unintelligible].
1:00 1:02 MALE:  [laughter]  That is very convenient.
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Very convenient.  
1:03 1:06 MALE: Did you live at home, or did you live on the university?
1:09 1:14 FEMALE:  At home for the first year and a half, and then I got a scholarship and went to the campus.
1:11 1:14 MALE:  All right, so you got the full college experience then?
1:18 1:21 FEMALE:  You know, I never--I don't--no, not really.  I never [unintelligible].  
1:18 1:24 MALE:  Ah, never had to live two people to one small room?
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  No, I never had to share back then. 
1:26 1:36 MALE:  Well, yeah, I think most universities like freshman year you are like kind of forced into that.  So, yeah, I had to do that.  It didn't go over too well.  Yeah.  
1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  I had [unintelligible] past time on these. 
1:38 1:55 MALE:  Yeah, because I don't know you basically both have to be doing like the same thing.  Otherwise, it doesn't really work because it's just one room, and there's no separators or anything.  So, yeah, you definitely did not miss anything by not having that experience.  
1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, the program [unintelligible].  
1:57 1:59 MALE:  So, how did you end up coming down to Stanford then?
2:03 2:11 FEMALE:  I worked [unintelligible].  I gave my [unintelligible].  
2:08 2:08 MALE:  Oh.  
2:13 2:15 FEMALE:  Hey, if you ever want to do your [unintelligible], just call.  
2:13 2:14 MALE:  Sounds like fun.  
2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  Give me my PhD.  
2:16 2:21 MALE:  Oh, really.  Do most people in that department do PhD, or?  
2:25 2:26 FEMALE:  There are two Master's students.  
2:24 2:25 MALE:  Yeah, mostly PhD.  
2:28 2:30 FEMALE:  What about yours?
2:27 2:32 MALE:  I don't know.  We all start at the Master's level, and then you can decide if you want to like go on or not.  
2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  So, what are you doing you think?
2:34 2:36 MALE:  I think I am not going to do that.
2:40 2:42 FEMALE:  Are you going to get your PhD somewhere else?
2:39 2:43 MALE:  No, I think I am going to just get a job somewhere, and...
2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  Where do you want to work?  
2:45 3:04 MALE:  I don't know.  I'm not that particular.  I'd like to work for one of the more well-known, larger aerospace companies just cause I think they work on like cooler projects and have more money, and they just generally do better, cooler stuff and I'd be more excited about the work that I'd be doing if I was working with them. 
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  Huh.  
3:05 3:08 MALE:  But I don't have a job lined up yet.  So...
3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  When do you graduate?
3:10 3:14 MALE:  I'm graduating in seven weeks or however much is left.  So...
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  Are you excited?  
3:17 3:28 MALE:  I'm excited, yeah.  Also, not that excited just cause I don't know now I'll have to like shift focus and actually do like real world things and....
3:31 3:33 FEMALE:  You have to [unintelligible].  I think it's exciting.
3:31 3:35 MALE:  Yeah, it's exciting while at the same time kind of like, ah.
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Ah, being a student is so nice.  
3:36 3:42 MALE:  Yeah, it is.  Be a professional student.  That is where it's at.  [laughter]  
3:45 3:49 FEMALE:  That's pretty much what I feel like.  Where are you going to [unintelligible]?
3:46 4:01 MALE:  I don't--I'm not that particular either about that, but most of the larger aerospace engineering centers are in LA or like right around there.  So, I wouldn't mind living down there, but it's just as nice there as it is here.
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:03 4:04 MALE:  All right, well it was nice talking to you.  
4:08 4:08 FEMALE:  Same to you.  
4:05 4:05 MALE:  Yeah.
