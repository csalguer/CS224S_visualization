0:00:02.7 0:00:03.2 MALE:  I'm male113. 
0:00:01.9 0:00:03.2 FEMALE:  Hi.  female138.
0:00:04.8 0:00:05.8 MALE:  And what department are you in? 
0:00:05.3 0:00:05.9 FEMALE:  Electrical.
0:00:06.8 0:00:07.5 MALE:  Oh really?
0:00:06.9 0:00:07.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:07.7 0:00:08.9 MALE:  Same here actually.
0:00:08.9 0:00:09.7 FEMALE:  That's nice.
0:00:09.9 0:00:12.3 MALE:  Are you- you're a master's student.
0:00:12.1 0:00:14.1 FEMALE:  Uh, I'm not sure yet.  I came here--
0:00:14.2 0:00:14.7 MALE:  Okay.
0:00:13.8 0:00:15.1 FEMALE:  -for a PhD but--
0:00:15.7 0:00:16.5 MALE:  Okay.
0:00:15.4 0:00:16.8 FEMALE:  -I'm having doubts.  [laughter]
0:00:16.9 0:00:19.1 MALE:  Yeah, I know how it is.  Yeah.
0:00:17.8 0:00:18.5 FEMALE:  What year are you?
0:00:19.8 0:00:20.8 MALE:  [unintelligible] year.
0:00:20.0 0:00:21.8 FEMALE:  So you're done?  Maybe. 
0:00:21.8 0:00:28.4 MALE:  Yeah.  I'm done with all that- well, we'll see.  It'll probably take me six overall.  But- 
0:00:27.4 0:00:28.9 FEMALE:  So you had doubts in the beginning?
0:00:29.6 0:00:34.1 MALE:  No.  I- I mean I knew I wanted to do research and, you know, I had a pretty- 
0:00:32.8 0:00:34.8 FEMALE:  For teaching wise or you want to be a professor?
0:00:35.1 0:00:37.2 MALE:  I don't- no, I think I just like doing research.  
0:00:36.5 0:00:37.0 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:00:37.6 0:00:52.2 MALE:  I think that's the kind of job I want and, um- and I've always been interested in like technology and doing science and it's- I don't know.  Ever since I was little- I guess it was kind of like pretty straightforward my whole life.  It's just one step leading to the next. 
0:00:51.8 0:00:55.8 FEMALE:  That's good.  I have been going around in circles trying to find my way.
0:00:55.6 0:00:56.1 MALE:  Oh really?
0:00:56.3 0:01:00.2 FEMALE:  Yeah because like when I was small I was really, really interested in, uh, music and art.
0:01:00.9 0:01:01.4 MALE:  Okay.
0:01:00.4 0:01:04.0 FEMALE:  So I did a lot of painting, a lot of performing arts.
0:01:04.8 0:01:05.6 MALE:  Oh yeah, yeah.
0:01:04.7 0:01:12.6 FEMALE:  And then I went to college and I was [unintelligible] dotcom.  And my parents said like you better, you know, make money to like feed yourself somehow.  Being an artist you might not-- you know you-
0:01:12.8 0:01:13.8 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:01:12.3 0:01:21.9 FEMALE:  -have to eat sometime.  So I said, okay, let's just try to dotcom my way through because before I started college my friend- he- before he took his final, um, final-
0:01:22.7 0:01:23.1 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:21.9 0:01:28.6 FEMALE:  -before he graduated as a senior, he already had like five hundred thousand dollars in stock options.  And I was like, that's gonna be me. 
0:01:27.9 0:01:28.4 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:28.6 0:01:29.7 FEMALE:  That is so me.
0:01:29.6 0:01:34.8 MALE:  I have friends like that.  Well my friend, my old roommate, he's- he's like number- employee three hundred like at Google.
0:01:34.1 0:01:34.7 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.
0:01:35.3 0:01:38.5 MALE:  So he's worth like five- ten million dollars now.
0:01:38.0 0:01:39.0 FEMALE:  Nice car and- 
0:01:39.0 0:01:47.5 MALE:  [unintelligible] yeah, he was shopping for a car the other day.  And we- people got to there and he's like yeah, I'll pay for it.  And we're like, yeah, you better pay for it. 
0:01:46.7 0:01:47.7 FEMALE:  Wow.  That's nice.
0:01:47.2 0:01:55.4 MALE:  [laughter] But, yeah, it was an exciting time actually when I first got to Stanford.  The dotcom was still going.
0:01:54.7 0:01:56.6 FEMALE:  Okay.  So that was '00 right?
0:01:56.6 0:01:57.9 MALE:  It was like 2000.  Yeah.
0:01:56.7 0:01:57.3 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:58.1 0:02:04.0 MALE:  And yeah, just to see all the different companies- it- it was a really like dynamic environment- 
0:02:03.3 0:02:08.1 FEMALE:  But did it make you feel like strange like why am I doing research when everyone else is like raking in money?
0:02:09.2 0:02:15.6 MALE:  I don't know.  Well, 'cause, you know, at the same time like, uh- like say professors not- they're not left out of it right even though they have like-
0:02:14.2 0:02:15.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, they had their share of funds. 
0:02:15.7 0:02:22.1 MALE:  -their PhD and stuff.  Right.  So- but I figured it would last longer, right?  Like when I get out of school it'll still be going on and stuff.
0:02:20.7 0:02:21.2 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:22.2 0:02:34.0 MALE:  And then like a year later it all crashed.  And everybody like- so all my friends had- you know before they had crazy ideas for a website this and website that.  And it was all so na"ive.  But-  
0:02:33.1 0:02:36.2 FEMALE:  But I mean like you can still be like Sergey and Larry- 
0:02:36.7 0:02:37.1 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:36.1 0:02:40.3 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] you could just take your lab idea and like try to commercialize it.
0:02:40.8 0:02:42.9 MALE:  Yeah.  It- it's a one out of a million thing.
0:02:42.9 0:02:43.7 FEMALE:  What are you working on? 
0:02:44.2 0:02:56.2 MALE:  Um, I do like lasers and optics.  My professor he's mainly- he's not really into doing something that's mainstream popular use, he's more like, uh, making things that are for scientists to use.  
0:02:55.4 0:02:57.0 FEMALE:  Okay.  The good old-fashioned science. 
0:02:57.6 0:03:06.9 MALE:  Yeah, so-- well it's like he- we're developing a technology that like, um, will enable future experiments.  'Cause like- say, um, making a better particle accelerator. 
0:03:06.2 0:03:06.7 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:07.2 0:03:13.9 MALE:  Or a gravitational wave sensor.  So we do like the- the engineering back end of scientific experiments basically. 
0:03:13.5 0:03:13.9 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:14.3 0:03:23.2 MALE:  Uh, and my parents they kind of don't see as much value in that 'cause they're like if it's not like a better VCR or a better computer.
0:03:22.6 0:03:23.1 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.
0:03:23.6 0:03:27.0 MALE:  You know?  It needs to be something in everyday use.  But I-
0:03:25.7 0:03:28.3 FEMALE:  Okay.  So they're more like business practical people.
0:03:28.3 0:03:30.5 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  But- you know- 
0:03:29.3 0:03:33.8 FEMALE:  But so were they okay with your PhD [unintelligible] you know, as a career choice? 
0:03:33.2 0:03:44.7 MALE:  Well, yeah, they pretty much let me do whatever I want.  But it's they- they just don't see things the same way- you know we don't value the same things, I think.  So-
0:03:44.3 0:03:47.7 FEMALE:  So like I think my mom still kind of hopes that I will go to business school one day.
0:03:48.1 0:03:48.7 MALE:  Oh really.
0:03:47.8 0:03:58.1 FEMALE:  And for me it's like I haven't crossed it off my list.  I still like- you know I'm still wondering what- what if I want to be a lawyer, a business person, you know an artist [laughter] I still have dreams of going back to art school.
0:03:58.5 0:03:59.3 MALE:  Oh yeah.
0:03:58.7 0:03:59.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:59.5 0:04:00.3 MALE:  Wow.
0:04:00.0 0:04:02.5 FEMALE:  So like I really haven't like picked my major yet.
0:04:00.6 0:04:11.6 MALE:  [unintelligible] That's a tough place to be.  Yeah.  It's like- 'cause probably you see a lot of other people, they seem to know exactly what they want to do, a lot of your classmates. 
0:04:10.6 0:04:11.4 [horn]
0:04:11.1 0:04:14.4 FEMALE:  Or they're sort of like you, they've only had one life- love in their life, you know. 
0:04:14.0 0:04:18.8 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, was that the bell or-
0:04:18.2 0:04:20.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Well it was nice to you.  
0:04:20.6 0:04:22.1 MALE:  It was good meeting you, female138 was it or-
0:04:21.5 0:04:21.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:04:22.6 0:04:24.5 MALE:  Okay.  See you later.
