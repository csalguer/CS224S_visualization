0:04 0:04 MALE:  Hi, my name's male118.
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  male118, yeah female122.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:07 0:10 FEMALE:  Yeah, good to meet you.  I cheated a little bit because I overhead.
0:10 0:16 MALE:  I know.  This is terrible for me because I'm always next to the [unintelligible].  So everyone's always going to be able to hear.
0:17 0:19 FEMALE:  But that's okay.  I mean I overheard you run?
0:19 0:20 MALE:  Yeah.
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  Where do you like to run on campus?
0:22 0:27 MALE:  Well when I run by myself out of convenience, I usually just run campus loop.
0:27 0:27 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:28 0:30 MALE:  But then on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I run with a running club.
0:31 0:31 FEMALE:  Oh really?
0:32 0:35 MALE:  So whatever they have up for the day, I'm good for.
0:35 0:36 FEMALE:  How far does the running club run?
0:37 1:05 MALE:  Well they say they have a three mile and a six mile run everyday, but from my experiences, there's like two or three guys who are like really good who run six miles and just like blow everyone away, and everyone else is like slower and just runs three.  So I mean I would prefer to run six, but I can't keep up with the other guys and I don't know where I'm going so I just stick to the three with everyone else.
1:06 1:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, so what is that like?  I just started running again and I try to make it up to the dish so I run halfway.
1:13 1:16 MALE:  Oh, the dish is terrible, though.  I went out there.  The hills are just nuts.
1:17 1:24 FEMALE:  I don't run the hill, but I run to the dish and then I walk up.  You know great view.
1:25 1:36 MALE:  Okay.  But supposedly like one of the best like running loops are like, at least like famous kind of, but the hills are too much.  I can't even, it's so hard.
1:37 1:40 FEMALE:  But it's worth it for the view so I do that.
1:40 1:41 MALE:  Yeah.  I mean I've been up there.  It's really nice up there.
1:42 1:48 FEMALE:  So I like that.  But just this morning, I discovered the trail beside the lake, too, so that was pretty.
1:49 1:50 MALE:  By the lake?
1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, the lake because there was water in it.
1:53 1:55 MALE:  Yeah, where you could see like the grass sticking up from bottom.
1:56 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] in there.
2:00 2:15 MALE:  It was actually I guess really nice like the past couple of months or something.  It had like a lot of water out there which is I guess uncharacteristic of it.  But it's normally like a dried up patch of ground, or so I've heard.
2:16 2:19 FEMALE:  I would expect so, [unintelligible].  What year are you?
2:20 2:22 MALE:  Well this is my first year at grad school.
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Your first year, me, too.
2:23 2:24 MALE:  Yeah.  What department?
2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  I'm in Genetics.
2:25 2:33 MALE:  Genetics?  I know almost nothing about that as far as a major goes.  So what is that like?
2:34 2:46 FEMALE:  Well it's actually a very diverse program.  So some people do [unintelligible] which is working with human [unintelligible] animals [unintelligible].  A lot of [unintelligible] stuff.
2:47 2:47 MALE:  Yeah.
2:48 2:58 FEMALE:  You have to be able to research it and be really careful like where the gene, how did the genes get turned on.  And I'm really interested in that, gene regulation.  What turns on the gene and stuff like that.
2:58 2:59 MALE:  Alright.
2:59 3:11 FEMALE:  Other people do the typical mutant.  Right now I'm in a group fly lab where we're taking mutants from a setting.  You know the biological pathways [unintelligible].
3:12 3:13 MALE:  That's pretty interesting.
3:14 3:15 FEMALE:  So a lot of different stuff, yeah.  [unintelligible].
3:23 3:26 MALE:  Is that like a program that's setup more towards Masters or geared towards Ph.D.?
3:27 3:28 FEMALE:  Actually it's all Ph.D.
3:29 3:29 MALE:  All Ph.D.
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  They don't have a Masters program.
3:31 3:38 MALE:  And what do most of the people do when they come out of that program?  Work in industry or is it more of like academic?
3:39 3:44 FEMALE:  I think it tends to be more towards academic.  That's at least what I want to do.  I think I want to be a professor when I get done with this.
3:45 3:46 MALE:  Oh.
3:46 3:54 FEMALE:  Most people go on and do post op.  So do the research and you can get a job later.  That's kind of where we stand.
3:54 3:55 MALE:  Sounds like fun.
3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, but I overheard you're in --
3:58 3:59 MALE:  [unintelligible] in the Engineering school.
3:59 4:02 FEMALE:  Okay.  Oh boy.
4:05 4:06 MALE:  It was nice talking to you.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, good to meet you.
