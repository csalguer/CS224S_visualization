0:00 0:05 FEMALE: Oh geez.
0:05 0:05 MALE: [unintelligible].
0:05 0:10 FEMALE: I know.  I have to go back and catch up and I'm never gonna remember it.  That's fine.
0:10 0:10 MALE:  I'm male200.
0:11 0:16 FEMALE:  female227, nice to meet you.  So -
0:16 0:16 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Uh, go ahead. 
0:18 0:18 MALE:  Oh, no, no.
0:18 0:28 FEMALE:  I'm a business host student so I'm used to interviewing lately, so all I do is like preempt questions so I can tell them what I know and don't have to admit what I don't know. 
0:28 0:29 MALE:  That's always a good strategy to have.
0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:30 0:30 MALE: You [unintelligible] business [unintelligible]?
0:30 0:31 FEMALE: Yeah, uh-mm.
0:31 0:33 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm an engineering student.
0:33 0:33 FEMALE:    Cool.
0:33 0:35 MALE:    [unintelligible].
0:35 0:35 FEMALE:   Ah, interesting. 
0:35 0:39 MALE: Yeah, I always been interested in space, ever since a kid.
0:39 0:39 FEMALE: Yeah, cool.
0:40 0:40 MALE: I like to build stuff.
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:42 0:43 MALE:  But how 'bout yourself?
0:43 0:58 FEMALE:  Um, so I'm in a business school, I'm in a non-profit management, um, program there.  So probably going to work for a non-profit and make much less money then my classmates [laughter].
0:58 0:58 MALE:  As long as you enjoy it.
0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:00 1:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] non-profits did you have any minors you might want to try [unintelligible]?
1:02 1:09 FEMALE:   That's currently my issue.  I can't really decide what -- where I want to be, what I want to do, so -
1:09 1:09 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:10 1:17 FEMALE:   Yeah, I think the problem is I like all of them, so I can't narrow you know what I want to do.  I'll do anything so.
1:17 1:17 MALE:    Yeah [unintelligible]. 
1:18 1:23 FEMALE:  Not that good, but not helpful right now in my interviewing life.
1:23 1:25 MALE:  Yeah, it's a little hard to narrow down [unintelligible] yourself.
1:26 1:29 FEMALE:  Why do you want to do this?  Well, it sounded good, you know.
1:29 1:30 MALE:  Felt like a good idea at the time.
1:30 1:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  Not so sure now that you're asking me all these questions, but kind of how I felt lately.  So are you in -- how many years is your program?
1:38 1:48 MALE:  Um, well let's see, if I get an engineers degree, finally completed just in December and so [unintelligible] a good three, four years or so.
1:49 1:49 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:49 1:49 MALE:  And -
1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  Okay.   
1:51 1:54 MALE:  It probably normally doesn't take that long, but kind of like as you said, I didn't know what [unintelligible].
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:55 1:58 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  I can understand that.
1:59 2:02 MALE:  Till one day I got tired of it and said -
2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  Okay, this needs to be done now.
2:03 2:06 MALE:  [unintelligible] should of decided this a while ago.  
2:07 2:10 FEMALE:  Well, that's good.  I guess you're just not an over achiever on it.  
2:10 2:12 MALE:  I guess now.  I just didn't know better, I guess.
2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  So you're done now?
2:14 2:17 MALE:  I just finished up, I graduate in Janu -- I mean in June.
2:17 2:18 FEMALE:  Okay, great.
2:18 2:20 MALE:  So finally, relaxing, the pressure's off.
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:22 2:22 MALE:  Enjoying life a little more.
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Nice.  That's a good thing to do around here, definitely.
2:24 2:31 MALE:  Now you heard about myself [unintelligible].
2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.
2:31 2:33 MALE:  Middle of nowhere, right next to the [unintelligible].
2:33 2:33 FEMALE:  Oh, I love Colorado, yeah.
2:34 2:39 MALE:  [unintelligible] eastern plains area where there's usually less to see but mountains [unintelligible].
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:41 2:45 MALE:  We had our [unintelligible], we had our one stoplight, Barney Fife and everything.
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  God.
2:46 2:49 MALE:  How 'bout yourself?
2:49 2:53 FEMALE:  Um, I grew up in Minnesota, but not on a farm.  
2:53 2:53 MALE:  That's awesome, okay.
2:54 2:56 FEMALE:  There are -- our coast was on where pink farm used to be.
2:56 2:56 MALE:  Okay.
2:57 3:00 FEMALE:  But not when I was there.  It was a subdivision by the time I got there.
3:00 3:02 MALE:  More of a laid back life in a sense.
3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:03 3:05 MALE:  [unintelligible] hustle and bustle, yeah.  Yeah.
3:06 3:10 FEMALE:  We spent -- I spent like half of my childhood I feel like in Colorado, 'cause every summer we'd drive out from Minnesota to Colorado and -
3:11 3:15 MALE:  [unintelligible] summer time is when [unintelligible].
3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:17 3:17 MALE:  The lakes and stuff.
3:17 3:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And it's just like it's one of those things when you're a kid I think, it just seems like one of those things that everyone did.  Just drive to Colorado or wherever and camp and -
3:29 3:29 MALE:  It was enjoyable times.
3:30 3:31 FEMALE:  Oh, that's -- I love it, yeah.
3:31 3:33 MALE:  [unintelligible] mountains and all [unintelligible].
3:33 3:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Oh, that, we did all that and when I moved out here from D.C., which is where I lived before this, and we drove through Colorado, I drove across country into Colorado.
3:46 3:50 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:51 3:56 FEMALE:  I don't know what we took anymore.  It was last year, so you know, it's all kind of a blur now.
3:56 4:00 MALE:  It's kind of a blur, the first three states they all just start blurring together.
4:00 4:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So do you think you want to go back to Colorado?
4:03 4:05 MALE:  Eventually.  Yeah.  [unintelligible].
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
