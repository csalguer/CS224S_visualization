00:07  	00:07  	MALE:  female125, nice to meet you.

00:08  	00:08  	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.

00:10  	00:12  	MALE:  So, I'm a mechanical engineering student here.

00:13  	00:13  	FEMALE:  Okay.

00:13  	00:15  	MALE:  So, it's my fifth year, so I've been here for a little while.

00:16  	00:16  	FEMALE:  Fifth year, yeah.

00:17  	00:24  	MALE:  Yeah.  I'm in the PhD Program.   And I'm originally from LA.  Um, did my undergrad on the east coast and came back. 

00:24  	00:26  	FEMALE:  Where on the east coast?

00:26  	00:28  	MALE:  I was at Princeton, so spent a little time in Jersey.

00:28  	00:29  	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  I went to Williams.

00:29  	00:34  	MALE:  You did, okay.  Okay, that's in Boston, Massachusetts right?

00:35  	00:39  	FEMALE:  It's in Massachusetts.  It's like actually two and half hours from Boston, but it's like the closest city.

00:38  	00:43	MALE:  Yeah, you have like white and purple cow print is you're --.  I do a lot of cycling I've raced on the east coast and we would --

00:44  	00:44  	FEMALE:  Okay.

00:45  	00:50  	MALE:  Track out there and race in the snow, it's definitely different than out here.  So what program are you in?

00:50  	00:55  	FEMALE:  I'm in Education actually, doing education policy.  Um, doing my Masters.

00:55  	00:56  	MALE:  One year?  You're here for a year?

00:56  	00:58  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Just for a year.

00:59  	00:59  	MALE:  So what are you doing after that?

01:00  	01:03  	FEMALE:  I'm not sure yet actually interview on Tuesday, so.

01:03  	01:04  	MALE:  You looking to stay here or go wherever?

01:05  	01:19  	FEMALE:  Um, I'd rather stay here I think.  I'll probably look for that on both coasts just to be safe.  But hoping to stay here for a little while longer, because I don't really feel like -- I've only been here for a year and I don't really feel like -- and having it be grad school. 

01:19  	01:19  	MALE:  Hard to get rooted I would imagine.

01:20  	01:23  	FEMALE:  Exactly.  You don't feel like you've really live here.  So I feel like I --

01:23  	01:23  	MALE:  It's a nice place to explore.

01:24  	01:29  	FEMALE:  Exactly.  It's a really nice place.  I mean the weather is so fantastic and having grown up in Rochester, New York --

01:30 	01:31  	MALE:  Oh, okay, yeah.

01:33  	01:35  	FEMALE:  I'm like never okay, I'm never moving back.

01:35  	01:43  	MALE:   Yeah, I was -- yeah I know how the summer is -- kind of in that area.  I was out on Brookhaven on Long Island one year and oh man, it's a challenge.

01:44  	01:44  	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.

01:45  	01:49  	MALE:  So what have you been able to do here when you've not been working and stuff.

01:49  	01:57  	FEMALE:  I've been trying to get outside as much as possible.  And just [unintelligible].  I haven't done any like real serious hiking, but just kind of like doing something --

01:58  	01:58  	MALE:  Just to get out?

01:59  	02:07  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Every weekend I mean if it's only taking a walk in the [unintelligible], sometimes that's all I have time for, but, you know it's better than nothing.  Just walk that at least.

02:08  	02:09  	MALE:  That's pretty intense first year, like one year program.

02:11  	02:12  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  How about you?

02:13  	02:21  	MALE:  I do a lot of cycling as I said.  And I was actually just late because I was running buying some cycling stuff, but um, I'm racing for Stanford.

02:21  	02:21  	FEMALE:  Oh.

02:22  	02:24  	MALE:  It's a club sport.  And undergrads and grads can race together.

02:24  	02:26  	FEMALE:  That's too cool.

02:26  	02:34  	MALE:  It's a lot of fun.  You get to compete and you know, just have fun with it, travel and riding a bike you get to go around places.

02:34  	02:34  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

02:35  	02:43  	MALE:  So, it's really fantastic.  It takes a lot of time though, definitely.  My advisors probably [unintelligible], but yeah, so.

02:43  	02:56  	FEMALE:  That's funny.  But what a beautiful place to do it.  I feel like I talk about it like I've been here all the time, but I'm just like this is nice living in someplace that isn't covered in snow half the time.

02:56  	02:59 	MALE:  I guess you can drive through the snow.  Do you like to ski or anything like that?

03:00  	03:08 	FEMALE:  Yeah, well I used did used to ski.  I did used to ski a lot when I was growing up and then [unintelligible] for many years.  I didn't have the money when I was college to go skiing.  So I went up to Tahoe this winter [unintelligible] it was fantastic.  

03:15	03:15	MALE:  It was a good winter to do it.

03:15 	03:26  	FEMALE:  Yeah it was beautiful and it was nice -- you know comparing the east coast skiing experience.  I've been skiing once in Colorado in high school and it was so nice.

03:27  	03:31  	MALE:  I've been skiing once on the east coast.  That's my comparison.

03:32  	03:32  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

03:32  	03:35  	MALE:  It's a little bit challenging getting the [unintelligible] sliding up.

03:36  	03:41  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  My little brother managed to break his femur in one of those [unintelligible], so --

03:43 	03:43  	MALE:  Oh really. I mean that's serious.

03:44  	03:56  	FEMALE:  Oh, he's fine, he's fine.  He was like eight at the time, so.  Yeah, he was a little kid, like the next year he was like I'm ready to go skiing again.  I'm like are you crazy [laughter]?  No.

03:56  	03:59  	MALE:  So what -- [horn] what do you want to do after - I mean what do you do at college like do you teach or?

04:00  	04:06  	FEMALE:  I actually [unintelligible] research, the short term class anyway.  

04:07  	04:07  	MALE:  So nice to meet you.

04:08  	04:09  	FEMALE:  It was nice to meet you too.

04:09	04:09	MALE:  It was so short.
