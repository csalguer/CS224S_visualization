0:58 0:58 MALE:  Yeah.   
0:58 1:01 FEMALE:  Whether, like, you want to do it or not, like, everybody deals with language all the time. 
1:02 1:02 MALE:  Right, right.  
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  So everybody has some opinions.  
1:04 1:05 MALE:  In socio-linguistics, I mean my--

1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  Cool. 
1:22 1:25 MALE:  --that's the thing you always do, like hmm, that's too bad of a career path, sit there and listen to music all the time.

2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  What were you doing? 
2:24 2:27 MALE:  Um, it was with the rotary, so it was like teaching English for two-thirds of the time.

2:35 2:35 FEMALE:  Did you like it? D you have a good time? 
2:36 2:37 MALE:  Yeah.  I wish I knew more Japanese.  I knew like 20 words--
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Yes. 
2:39 2:40 MALE:  --know I now like 40 words now.  But it's still not enough to--
2:41 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, I didn't know anything when I went either and I really wished that I had known more.  It got a lot more fun once I was able to talk to people and like--
2:47 2:48 MALE:  Right. 
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  --interact, yeah.  
2:49 2:49 MALE:  So were you in like a large city then or? 
2:50 2:58 FEMALE:  I was in a city of about 3:00,000.  That was kind of in the middle of, like, a rural place, so down on the Southeast Coast of Kyushu, like down where there's palm trees and like, stuff.
2:59 2:59 MALE:  Oh really?  Wow. 
2:59 3:08 FEMALE:  So it was, it was pretty nice.  Yeah, it was a pretty good location, it was, it was a little boring, it could have been more exciting.  I used to, like, I used to go to, like, Goka which is the bigger city on the island-- 
3:09 3:09 MALE:  Oh yeah, exactly. 
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  --to go play sometimes because there was more stuff to do.  But--

3:16 3:17 FEMALE:  Oh really?  Okay.  
3:18 3:22 MALE:  Thought about going there.  There's like a, a volcano on the island, like Oto or something--
3:22 3:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, I went there like three times [laughter].  Yeah.  
3:26 3:30 MALE:  I had an option, I was either going to go to that volcano or there's like a cave system, like Shohoto [phonetic] Cave or something. 
3:31 3:32 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah, I don't know. 
3:32 3:33 MALE:  It's sort of north of Yuni [phonetic].   
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Uh huh. 
3:34 3:35 MALE:  We wound up going there, it was cool. 
3:36 3:36 FEMALE:  Okay. 
3:37 3:41 MALE:  It was cool, like you go out on the landscape, and it looked just like New Zealand or something.  It's like all the rocks jutting out in the grassland.
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  Oh yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of beautiful stuff--
3:43 3:45 MALE:  I'm like that could be Lord of the Rings.  
3:46 3:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love that country.  I fell in love with it when I was there and, and unfortunately, like it took me too long to get good enough at Japanese that I really, like felt that feeling--
3:55 3:55 MALE:  Right. 
3:55 3:56 FEMALE:  --and I'd already applied to grad school--
3:57 3:58 MALE:  Oh yeah.
