0:02 0:03 FEMALE: I'm female323.	
0:03 0:04 MALE: I'm male313.
0:04 0:08 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, male313. That scares me every time.
0:08 0:10 MALE: Yeah. You're really close to it, too.
0:10 0:11 FEMALE: I should get used to it.
0:12 0:16 MALE: No, no. [unintelligible] blasting you. You're like, that wasn't part of the bargain.
0:16 0:20 FEMALE: This is probably the most rigorous social event I've ever been to. It's very serious.
0:21 0:25 MALE: Keeping the time, down to the minutes is somewhat awkward I guess. So how's it going?
0:26 0:28 FEMALE: Good. Are you enjoying yourself?
0:28 0:30 MALE: Yeah. It's kind of interesting.
0:30 0:31 FEMALE: Do you know anybody? Did you come with any friends?
0:32 0:37 MALE: I came with a friend actually. The girl over there I used to date so it's kind of awkward.
0:38 0:39 FEMALE: Which one? The small girl.
0:39 0:40 MALE: No the one in the blue right there.
0:41 0:42 FEMALE: Oh. That is kind of awkward.
0:42 0:44 MALE: So we've been ignoring each other. Hey what's going on?
0:45 0:47 FEMALE: You had to sit there and talk to her for four minutes? Did it end badly?
0:48 0:51 MALE: No, it was okay.
0:51 0:53 FEMALE: That's not so bad. No, not the date but the relationship.
0:54 0:56 MALE: No, not really. We're on good terms. What about you?
0:56 1:04 FEMALE: [laughter] It's like I got to go to the bathroom. Yeah. My best friend nameX, you just met her.
1:04 1:06 MALE: Yeah. I just met her. So you're actually in education, then?
1:06 1:09 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. We actually teach in the same classroom right now, we're co-teachers.
1:11 1:12 MALE: Is that at Berkeley? She was talking about Berkeley High.
1:12 1:18 FEMALE: She is going there next year. Right now we're finishing our intern here but she is going to teach at Berkeley and I'm going to teach at San Lorenzo.
1:21 1:21 MALE: Sweet.
1:20 1:20 FEMALE: So it's exciting.
1:25 1:25 MALE: Sounds good.
1:22 1:25 FEMALE: It's nice to have a job and we have the summer off.
1:26 1:36 MALE: Yeah. I know. I did an internship last summer in Iowa, I was telling nameX about it. And it's so nice to come home from work and not have homework. It's like wow. I work eight hours but I'm free until tomorrow morning. 
1:35 1:42 FEMALE: You're done. Teaching doesn't really have that so much because you have to grade all their homework but it's okay. But what are you studying?
1:44 1:44 MALE: CS.
1:43 1:44 FEMALE: Okay. Are you doing your Masters or...?
1:45 1:47 MALE: No, PhD.	
1:47 1:48 FEMALE: Okay.
1:49 1:49 MALE: I'm in my third year so.
1:48 1:49 FEMALE: Out of?
1:50 1:58 MALE: Six maybe, I don't know. I [unintelligible] six, yeah. Go Class of 2008. I figure if I can graduate when the [unintelligible] freshman do then I'm doing well.
1:57 2:00 FEMALE: That's really intense. Did you come right from undergrad here?
2:01 2:16 MALE: I actually worked for a year, which was really good. I worked doing something related to what I'm doing now, which is verification. That was pretty good just to get the experience. You're not sort of ivory tower mindset, you actually have to do a job and do something that peopel are willing to pay for.
2:15 2:17 FEMALE: So where did you do undergrad work?
2:18 2:20 MALE: University of Texas in Austin.
2:20 2:20 FEMALE: That is longhorn?
2:21 2:21 MALE: Yeah, definitely. 
2:22 2:22 FEMALE: Did I get it right, this one?
2:25 2:26 MALE: It's like, uh huh. What about you?
2:25 2:26 FEMALE: I went to Carnegie Melon.
2:27 2:30 MALE: Oh cool. I almost went there for grad school actually.
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: Oh really?
2:32 2:34 MALE: Yeah. It was like my second choice. How was Pittsburgh?
2:33 2:39 FEMALE: It was okay. You made the better choice in terms of the weather and quality of life. Six years in Pittsburgh would be rough.
2:40 2:47 MALE: They were telling us about it and I felt like they were trying too hard. They were like, no really Pittsburgh doesn't suck.
2:46 3:01 FEMALE: Pittsburgh doesn't suck, it's actually really fun. I prefer the weather here, but I think Pittsburgh people are very wholesome. And it's just a great town to go to school in. I don't know if I'd want to stay there for six years, though.
3:02 3:02 MALE: So you were there for four, I guess?
3:03 3:10 FEMALE: Yeah. I grew up in New Jersey and I went to Pittsburgh for school. But I don't know. They have a great computer science school, though.
3:11 3:13 MALE: Yeah. They really do. They have a school of computer science, not just a department a school.
3:13 3:18 FEMALE: I know. It's an amazing program. I had a lot of friends who did it.
3:20 3:20 MALE: What was your undergrad?
3:19 3:21 FEMALE: Business sort of.
3:22 3:25 MALE: Not education? Can you use the business stuff at all?
3:24 3:28 FEMALE: No, of course not. Who gets a degree in business and uses it?
3:29 3:31 MALE: I don't know you may be able to [unintelligible].
3:30 3:45 FEMALE: Find a person some day who gets a degree in business and uses it. No, it's fine. Actually, it is useful; I learned a lot about-- it's always the things you learn that you don't think are going to be useful that turn out to be useful. But you're right, you have to do a lot of public speaking...
3:47 3:48 MALE: That's important.
3:46 4:01 FEMALE: ...and a lot of professional writing. And all those things really serve you well as a teacher. They are going to blow this thing and scare me to death again. But I don't know. I did really [unintelligible], it's just sort of...you made a better choice.
4:00 4:01 MALE: So you think I made a better choice.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE: [horn] Oh. That was tolerable. Oh.
4:04 4:06 MALE: Great. Well it was nice to meet you.
4:05 4:06 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, male313.
4:06 4:07 MALE: Good luck.
4:07 4:08 FEMALE: Thank you.
