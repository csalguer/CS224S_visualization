4:00 4:02 MALE: Oh. That's very cool.
3:47 3:50 FEMALE: What kind of area of law are you doing?

4:05 4:07 FEMALE: That's good. Well we need good prosecutors, right?
4:26 4:34 MALE: Yeah, that's right. A good ethical, yeah. And then my goal is to be a trial judge way, way down the road and many political contributions later.
4:15 4:15 FEMALE: That's kind of cool.
