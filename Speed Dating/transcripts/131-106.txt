0:40 0:40 MALE:  Okay.  
0:41 0:44 FEMALE:  I actually came from a business [unintelligible].  
0:45 0:45 MALE:  Oh, really.  
0:45 0:51 FEMALE:  So, I'm [unintelligible] I think to keep sort of like keep studying some of the [unintelligible] like we've done before.  
0:52 0:52 MALE:  Okay, uh-huh.  
0:53 0:56 FEMALE:  But I actually still want  to practice law, and I think I want to do it in much more social and political issues.  
0:57 0:59 MALE:  Okay, oh really.  Okay.  
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  So, I don't know.  
1:00 1:02 MALE:  Uh-huh, meaning [unintelligible]?  
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  I [unintelligible] the law school this year.  
1:04 1:04 MALE:  Okay.  
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  Where are you from?  
1:05 1:22 MALE:  I'm from Minnesota.  I went to Berkely for undergrad.  So, yeah I'm in computer science.  I work in the genetics department.  I'm interested in computational biology.  That's right now what I think I want to do at least.  
1:23 1:31 FEMALE:  This is really funny.  We had a law school project first semester, and it involved taking people [unintelligible] computational biology.  
1:31 1:31 MALE:  Really?  
1:32 1:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was actually like they wanted to [unintelligible] pharmaceutical companies.  
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  And [unintelligible].  
1:39 1:39 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:39 1:41 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] and guys with genetic information.  
1:42 1:42 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:42 1:54 FEMALE:  I don't know what you call it.  I'm a lawyer, not a scientist.  But it's truly [unintelligible] because we have to like learn a little bit about, um, [unintelligible] I can't remember the name, bioinformatics.  
1:55 1:56 MALE:  Yeah, uh-huh.  
1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  Is that the kind of stuff that you would go on and do?  
1:58 2:11 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, that's actually--the project I'm working on now is like a database of proteins.  It's not for a pharmaceutical company so I won't need you to come in here and save me probably because no one is going to get mad at me about anything.  
2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  Liability.  
2:11 2:11 MALE:  Yeah.
2:12 2:16 FEMALE:  Are you getting the database ready for Stanford, or some other organization?  
2:17 2:33 MALE:  It's going to be, yeah, I guess by the professor [unintelligible] that I'm working for.  It will be like a public database, and everyone can download stuff from I guess.  That's the plan.  So, where did you work before here?  
2:34 2:36 FEMALE:  I worked for a [unintelligible] company.  
2:36 2:36 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  Have you heard of them?  
2:37 2:45 MALE:  I think so.  Let's just say yes.  We only have four minutes.  So, where was that?  
2:45 2:47 FEMALE:  It was in Denver, Colorado.  
2:47 2:48 MALE:  Uh-huh, where are you from?  
2:49 2:50 FEMALE:  I'm actually from around here.  I'm from San Jose originally.  
2:51 2:52 MALE:  Oh, really.  
2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Where are you from?  
2:53 2:55 MALE:  Yeah, uh-huh, where did you go to undergrad?  
2:56 2:57 FEMALE:  I went to Harvard.  
2:57 3:00 MALE:  Oh, okay.  You've been everywhere pretty much.  
3:01 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] if you consider Chicago your [unintelligible].  
3:08 3:13 MALE:  Yeah, same thing, right?  And then the Rockies [unintelligible].  
3:14 3:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:14 3:16 MALE:  Maybe next, huh.
3:16 3:26 FEMALE:  You know I'm actually--the area of law [unintelligible] that celebrates law, and actually in the south of Chicago there's a [unintelligible].  
3:26 3:27 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:28 3:32 FEMALE:  And that [unintelligible] work.  So, who would have ever thought I would [unintelligible].  
3:32 3:33 MALE:  It might actually happen, yeah.  
3:34 3:36 FEMALE:  People are already [unintelligible].  
3:37 3:38 MALE:  Yeah, a little bit of risk.

4:09 4:10 MALE:  Oh definitely, yeah.  
4:10 4:12 FEMALE:  Find out where they're from and if they're background [unintelligible].  
4:13 4:14 MALE:  And from their accent also.  
4:15 4:15 FEMALE:  Yeah.
