0:12 0:14 FEMALE:  This is so hard.  It's like way more work than I thought it would be.

0:26 0:26 MALE:  Education? 
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  PhD.
0:27 0:30 MALE:  Yeah, it's like everyone is in education here.

0:40 0:40 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:38 0:43 FEMALE:  I know like the helpers [unintelligible] like nameX, and [unintelligible], and [unintelligible].  
0:46 0:47 MALE:  All right, sounds cool.  
0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  What do you do?  
0:48 0:52 MALE:  I am in aeronautics and astronautics in the engineering school.  
0:51 0:53 FEMALE:  Cool.  That's complicated.  
0:55 1:03 MALE:  I guess so.  Just standard engineering discipline.  So, nothing too special about it, I guess.  
1:02 1:04 FEMALE: Are you in Master's or probably PhD?  
1:06 1:26 MALE:  I am in Master's, and I'm actually set to graduate at the end of this quarter.  So, kind of excited, kind of anxious, or nervous about what's coming next.  I don't have anything lined up yet. So, it's still all in the open.  How's your program going along?  
1:25 1:30 FEMALE:  It's good.  It's hard, you know.  I'm a first-year, and so I'm still trying to just figure out the lay of the land.  
1:33 1:34 MALE:  Yeah, makes sense.  
1:33 1:45 FEMALE:  I don't really know.  I mean I did a research project this quarter that was like really intense [unintelligible] my advisor.  So, I'm [unintelligible].  And now I'm trying to catch up on all [unintelligible] classes.  
1:48 1:52 MALE:  Oh, wow.  What kind of stuff do you like to do for fun?  
1:51 1:57 FEMALE:  Uh, I like to really just I don't know chill out.  I like to walk the dish or like, you know, just listen to music.  
1:59 1:59 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:58 2:05 FEMALE: I like going to movies a lot, but I haven't don't as much of that here.  I was [unintelligible] the other day [unintelligible] movies going.  
2:07 2:18 MALE:  Just too busy with work and stuff?  Yeah.  So that happens at this school a lot, people getting bogged down in a little too much work.  
2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Not enough fun.  
2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:21 2:28 MALE:  Unless you have fun doing your work, which some people do.  Yeah, see that's not the same for me.  Yeah.  
2:26 2:29 FEMALE:  What about you, what do you do for fun, male118?  
2:31 2:50 MALE: I don't know.  I go out running every day because I really like running.  I did it all through like high school and stuff.  I don't know.  Otherwise, just basically any type of physical activity like sports or even watching sports is good.  I don't know.  Otherwise, the  music and such--standard fare.  
2:49 2:52 FEMALE:  Where did you do your undergrad?  
2:54 2:57 MALE:  At Perdue University in Indiana. 
2:55 2:55 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:58 3:00 MALE:  Close to where I grew up outside of Chicago.  
2:58 3:01 FEMALE:  Do you like the California [unintelligible]?
3:04 3:16 MALE:  Well, the weather is a lot nicer obviously.  Uh, otherwise, I don't know.  They both have their easy points.  I mean I grew up outside of Chicago.  So, I had that huge big city environment.  
3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  You're not [unintelligible].  
3:19 3:26 MALE:  Yeah, so it's not like a huge difference or anything.  The weather is just the main thing.  Where did, uh, where did you grow up?  
3:25 3:25 FEMALE:  In California.  
3:27 3:28 MALE:  In California.  
3:26 3:27 FEMALE:  Sacramento.  
3:30 3:32 MALE:  Oh, so basically around this--close to this area.  
3:31 3:33 FEMALE:  I lived in LA for a while, but [unintelligible].  
3:35 3:37 MALE:  Was that where you went to undergrad, or?  
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, I did undergrad at Berkley.  
3:39 3:39 MALE:  Berkley.  
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  I lived in LA for high school.  
3:41 3:42 MALE:  For high school.  
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  Well, my mom lives there.  My dad lives [unintelligible].  
3:44 3:44 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
3:43 3:44 FEMALE:  Kind of go all around.  
3:48 3:51 MALE:  So how do you compare this to LA?  Like--
3:49 3:51 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Oh, I would never live in southern California.  
3:53 3:54 MALE:  Why is that?  
3:52 4:00 FEMALE:  I just think it's like ugly.  I know that's really like sad to say, but it's like I find it really too many people and smog, and--
4:02 4:04 MALE:  Yeah, the smog is kind of grouse.  
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  It smells beautiful here just kind of in comparison.  
4:08 4:09 MALE:  All right, yeah.  
4:07 4:07 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you, male118.  
4:09 4:10 MALE:  Yeah, it was nice talking to you.
