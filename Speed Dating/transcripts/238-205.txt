00:01  00:04	MALE:  [horn] male205.
00:05  00:07	FEMALE:  It's so hard to fill in that quickly.
00:08  00:08	MALE:  Killer.
00:09  00:09	FEMALE:  Exactly.
00:10  00:13	MALE:  They are, especially if you want to do the person justice.  I can be an asshole, but like I don't really want to like just --
00:14  00:15	FEMALE:  Well, take your time.
00:16  00:18	MALE:  Thank you, I appreciate that, but I don't want to cut into our date.  I don't know.  Hi, I'm male205.
00:25  00:26	FEMALE:  Hi, male205.  I'm female238.
00:26  00:26	MALE:  Nice to meet you, female238.
00:27  00:27	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
00:30  00:31	MALE:  How are you enjoying your evening?
00:31  00:34	FEMALE:  It's -- I'm a little blurred at this point.  It's a bit much.
00:35  00:36	MALE:  Yes.  Let's make stuff up.  
00:37  00:37	FEMALE:  Okay.
00:38  00:39	MALE:  All right.  Where are you from?
00:39  00:40	FEMALE:  Virginia.
00:41  00:45	MALE:  Excellent.  I'm from Moscow; I've got to work with that.
00:46  00:46	FEMALE:  Really.
00:47  00:47	MALE:  Yes, yes.
00:48  00:50	FEMALE:  It's a good thing about Moscow is that it's so close to Virginia.
00:51  00:51	MALE:  It is.
00:52  00:53	FEMALE:  And they're so similar.
00:53  00:54	MALE:  They are.  I hear the weather is about the same, the swamps.
00:54  00:57	FEMALE:  All the same, people, dislikes, the vodka is better in Virginia.
00:58  00:59	MALE:  Really?
01:00  01:00	FEMALE:  Yes.
01:01  01:04	MALE:  I don't know, I'll have to take you back to my place and give you some primo vodka.
01:05  01:07	FEMALE:  So you really have primo vodka.
01:08  01:08	MALE:  I do.
01:09  01:11	FEMALE:  I've been exploring primo tequila these days.
01:12  01:16	MALE:  Really?  I didn't know primo made tequila; I thought they were only in the vodka business.
01:17  01:18	FEMALE:  I thought we were use primo as a generic adjective, not a brand name.
01:19  01:20	MALE:  Well, we were, but then I tried to make a joke out of it.
01:21  01:22	FEMALE:  Oh man.  Okay.
01:22  01:22	MALE:  Sorry.
01:23  01:23	FEMALE:  I was confused.
01:23  01:24	MALE:  It is late in the day.
01:24  01:26	FEMALE:  It is.  I told you I was blurred.  I'm um --
01:27  01:28	MALE:  What are you studying?
01:28  01:43	FEMALE:  Are we still making things up [laughter]?  I'm studying to be ah, um, I'm studying to be a candy stripper.
01:44  01:44	MALE:  Candy stripper.
01:45  01:48	FEMALE:  Which is like a candy striper, but a little different.
01:49  01:49	MALE:  How so?
01:50  01:52	FEMALE:  Well, --
01:53  01:54	MALE:  Because I have lots of vivid imagery.
01:55  02:04	FEMALE:  What you do is take all the wrappings off the candy and then you give it to people in the hospital [laughter].
02:05  02:06	MALE:  Okay.  
02:07  02:08	FEMALE:  What do you study?
02:09  02:15	MALE:  Um -- I should be better prepared for this.  Navel architecture.
02:16  02:16	FEMALE:  Really?
02:17  02:17	MALE:  Yes.
02:18  02:20	FEMALE:  Do people in the navy build buildings very often?
02:21  02:23	MALE:  I just said navels.  I don't know anything about those people actually.
02:24  02:28	FEMALE:  [laughter] um, do you work on innies or outies or a whole new type?  Or is there one I don't know of.
02:29  02:32	MALE:  I'm a big fan of the innie, but I have --
02:33  02:34	FEMALE:  Classic taste, I like that.
02:35  02:40	MALE:  Exactly, yes.  But it's pretty much the whole landscape that I'm a fan of.  
02:41  02:41	FEMALE:  Right.
02:42  02:45	MALE:  So, I start with the belly and then work in the innie. 
02:46  02:47	FEMALE:  Try to fit it in the landscape there.
02:48  02:48	MALE:  Exactly, yeah.
02:49  02:50	FEMALE:  What's your opinion on navel rings?
02:50  02:54	MALE:  Navel rings.  I'm a big fan.  I like it if it's tasteful, understated. 
02:55  02:56	FEMALE:  Okay.
02:57  03:02	MALE:  Kind of hard for, you know, kind of hard for navel ring to really do that, subtle, I like subtle.
03:03  03:04	FEMALE:  Subtle, a subtle navel ring.
03:04  03:06	MALE:  Silver over gold --
03:07  03:13	FEMALE:  Right.  So you don't think the little playboy bunny hanging from the navel are really --
03:14  03:16	MALE:  I could dig it I think.  Why do you have one?
03:17  03:18	FEMALE:  No, I don't -- yes, I have four [laughter].
03:19  03:22	MALE:  Okay, very nice.  That's not really understated though.
03:23  03:24	FEMALE:  No, no, it's not.  
03:25  03:25	MALE:  Matching tattoo?
03:26  03:30	FEMALE:  We have a mat that clashes dreadfully, actually.
03:31  03:34	MALE:  Well, it's a statement, you know.  It's good you have your own sense of style.  I like that.
03:35  03:37	FEMALE:  What was the last thing you bought.
03:38  03:41	MALE:  The last thing I bought was the primo vodka in my cupboard.
03:42  03:42	FEMALE:  Umm.
03:43  03:56	MALE:  Yes.  That and um, school books -- no, um, ah, that doesn't work too well.  Um, are we still lying? 
03:57  03:58	FEMALE:  Do you drink it neat or chilled?
03:58  03:59	MALE:  Chilled, actually.
03:59  04:00	FEMALE:  Okay.
04:01  04:02	MALE:  I'm a man of refined taste [horn].
04:03  04:04	FEMALE:  Glad to hear that.
04:04  04:04	MALE:  And your tequila?
04:05  04:06	FEMALE:  Neat but with Sangrita as a chaser.
04:07  04:10	MALE:  Very nice.  Well, I'd like a chance to lie with you more often.
04:11  04:12	FEMALE:  [laughter] see ya.
04:18  04:19	MALE:  Thank you.  That was pretty good.  I made that up on the spot.
04:20  04:20	FEMALE:  Yeah, you should use that next time.
