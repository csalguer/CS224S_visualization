0:14 0:14 MALE:  Oh really?

0:13 0:31 FEMALE:  --to be.  This [unintelligible] I realized like I live in my little world of my department and you kind of forget that there's this big universe of Stanford out there.  So it's actually kind of fun to be forced to interact with people not in your department. [laughter]

0:33 0:35 MALE:  [laughter]  So what department [unintelligible] 

0:33 0:35 FEMALE:  I'm right here at the school of education--

0:37 0:37 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:35 0:41 FEMALE:  --so it's even more strange that this is happening like where I have my classes everyday so.  Anyway, what department are you in?

0:43 0:45 MALE:  I'm in the [unintelligible] engineering.

0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  Oh, very cool.

0:46 0:47 MALE:  Yeah, I'm second year [unintelligible]

0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  Okay, PhD or masters?

0:50 0:50 MALE:  I haven't decided.

0:49 0:51 FEMALE:  Oh, [laughter]

0:53 0:57 MALE:  Like I'm in [unintelligible] I haven't really, uh--[unintelligible]

0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:57 1:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] kind of tempted [unintelligible] 

1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  And work?

1:03 1:04 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Make money.

1:05 1:08 MALE:  Make money and, uh, [unintelligible] 

1:10 1:16 FEMALE:  Oh [laughter]  very good.  So what are you doing--what are you studying in electrical engineering?  Like what's your focus?

1:15 1:18 MALE:  Uh, my focus [unintelligible] 

1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:18 1:23 MALE:  --uh [unintelligible] 

1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:23 1:25 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:25 1:28 MALE:  And then even people [unintelligible] 

1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:28 1:34 MALE:  [unintelligible] their focus [unintelligible] 

1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  [laughter]

1:35 1:39 MALE:  [unintelligible] so I'm doing mainly, uh, systems, which means like software--

1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:40 1:41 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:43 1:45 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Very cool.  Very cool.

1:43 1:46 MALE:  So, uh [unintelligible]

1:48 1:49 FEMALE:  What's that?

1:47 1:50 MALE:  [unintelligible] computers [unintelligible] 

1:52 2:02 FEMALE:  Well, I must admit my dad is a--is a programmer.  And so when I was younger he used to--whenever I was born he'd hand me a programming book and say read this.

2:01 2:01 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:03 2:04 FEMALE:  And so I think--no because--

2:02 2:03 MALE:  [laughter]

2:05 2:25 FEMALE:  --I think--I think that that was my youthful rebellion.  And so I never really learned the programming side and kind of the--the more system side of it as like my rebellion against my dad.  [laughter]  Although I--although as time has gone on I'm--I--I--I've become proficient in the software that I need to know how to use to--to do the work that I need to do.

2:24 2:28 MALE:  Yeah, these days [unintelligible] software [unintelligible] 

2:30 2:56 FEMALE:  Uh, very much so.  Very much so.  Even my mom, she has a computer now, she does email.  She uses Microsoft Word.  This is like a big step for the woman.  Like the first time when I studied abroad and like she didn't know how to do email and so she needed to learn.  And I get his like email from here that was like [unintelligible] but I couldn't do it so I woke your sister up really early in the morning so she could help.  And then I got one from my sister that's like, she woke me up so early.  I was just [laughter].

2:54 2:55 MALE:  [laughter]

2:57 2:58 FEMALE:  So she's made lots of progress.

2:57 2:59 MALE:  So what's your, uh, focus [unintelligible] 

3:02 3:07 FEMALE:  Um, actually higher education and specifically health professional education.  So--

3:05 3:05 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:08 3:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I worked in, uh, a dental school before coming here and now I actually work at the medical school.  Kind of I worked in admissions before and now I work in the curriculum side.  And so my focus is actually in medical and dental education.

3:20 3:22 MALE:  [unintelligible] working admission [unintelligible] the dental school.

3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  I did, back in Boston I worked--I worked at a dental school.

3:26 3:27 MALE:  In the admission department?

3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

3:31 3:33 MALE:  [unintelligible] all these people [unintelligible] and application.

3:35 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I--I have contributed to the future dental profession.

3:38 3:38 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:40 3:45 FEMALE:  The--the future of the profession.  Some of them I [laughter].

3:43 3:45 MALE:  So--so what do you think about the whole admission process?

3:48 3:51 FEMALE:  Um, [unintelligible] it was very emotional.

3:50 3:50 MALE:  Yeah.

3:52 4:09 FEMALE:  Um, one of the worst things in the world to do is to reject someone but you have to.  And so I--I think I--and there are a lot of ethical pieces of it as well.  And so I tried to do the best that I could to kind of make very moral judgments and everything like that but--

4:07 4:08 MALE:  Yeah [unintelligible] 

4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  And I read every application.

4:09 4:10 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] it was wonderful meeting you.

4:12 4:13 MALE:  It was nice talking to you, female137.
