0:26 0:31 MALE: That's also, it's better than at least being out there doing, working at the [unintelligible] company, I guess.
0:38 0:44 FEMALE: I, that's my approach to it, yes, I think so.  But you know, like it's fun being a student, actually really like it, and I like Stanford a lot, so.

1:24 1:25 MALE: And I get so lost.
1:32 1:32 FEMALE: In what way?
1:28 1:28 MALE: Just the roads.
1:34 1:38 FEMALE: Culturally, language-wise, way and roads.  Like [unintelligible]
1:31 1:32 MALE: Language not so much of a problem.
1:38 1:39 FEMALE: Okay, yeah.
1:33 1:35 MALE: Because cultural is- is sort of filtering out--
1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Okay.
1:36 1:37 MALE: It's very much the same coming to-- 
1:42 1:44 FEMALE: Okay, interesting.  
1:38 1:41 MALE: Yeah, it is- it is just the way everything works here.  So different.
1:47 1:50 FEMALE: Right, right, right, right, right.  I'm sure.  Wow.
1:45 1:46 MALE: Yeah, yeah.
1:51 1:51 FEMALE: That's cool.
1:46 1:48 MALE: And when I go back it's going to be even, it's going to be really difficult.
1:54 1:57 FEMALE: So you're- you're going back in the year, like you're definitely going back, you're not staying?  
1:50 1:51 MALE: No, I haven't been out--
1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Oh, you mean to visit.
1:53 1:53 MALE: To visit.
2:00 2:00 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
1:54 1:57 MALE: So it's really funny, but I'm going to go home for a vacation.  [laughter]
2:03 2:48 FEMALE: Right, of course.  I'm actually in the same shoes because uh, I grew up in Croatia, I was born and grew up in Croatia, and I came, I did my undergrad at Stanford, but uh, you know, the same thing, you know, it's like, you know, vacation, but I'm going, I'm going home, you know, like, and I mean, I'm in school, I like it, but like it just, it feels kind of strange to be sort of, you get transplanted essentially.  But after here a while, though, like it's truly, you get- you get used to it, like I realize that I really love this place.  After my first year, I went to Croatia and I came back, and like I was, you know, driving to nameX- you know, like to Palm- down Palm drive, and it's just like home, and it was like, "OKay, I am in the right place," hence fast forward five years, I'm still here and never leaving as the way it's going right now, so, yeah, I'll be here for a awhile.  [laughter]  Anyway.
2:42 2:45 MALE: So what- what brought you here to speed-dating?  A friend pushed you into this?
2:51 3:02 FEMALE: Um, I don't know whether you got-- they were like giving fliers out, like they were leaving flyers in front of people's doors.  So it's just I got a flyer, and I was like, "Oh, you know, could be fun.  Sounds like efficient way and like an interesting way to meet people, so might as well." 
2:56 2:57 MALE: Absolutely, yeah.
3:03 3:04 FEMALE: How about you?
2:58 3:00 MALE: What- what-- I am friend with nameX.
3:05 3:05 FEMALE: Okay.
3:00 3:01 MALE: And she said, you know, I have this research program, you've got to help me.
3:07 3:07 FEMALE: [laughter]
3:02 3:08 MALE: I said, "Okay."  And she goes, "It's speed dating," I said, "Okay, that's fun." And she [unintelligible]  Uh, okay.  [laughter]
3:14 3:21 FEMALE: Less fun, less fun.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, actually, I find actually it's less awkward with this thing on.  Like I'm finding it to be like this very kind of--
3:16 3:16 MALE: Mic.
3:22 3:28 FEMALE: --table mic, you know, I can, you know, I think that really felt really weird, I kind of forget that this is here, so I'm just like, whatever, you know.  
3:22 3:26 MALE: Yeah, absolutely.  So what do you do for fun apart from slicing, um-- [laughter]
3:33 3:40 FEMALE: Slicing people?  Uh, I don't do that, I mean, I don't do that, with my anatomy.  So, I- I do a lot of dancing.  I do uh-- 
3:34 3:34 MALE: Salsa?
3:40 3:41 FEMALE: I do salsa, yes.  
3:35 3:36 MALE: Oh, uh, because-- 
3:42 3:53 FEMALE: I do like, I mean, social dancing, general, and salsa, so like, you know, waltz, swing, salsa, like all those things.  And then um, I mean I like to like just do regular dancing, [unintelligible] like you know, yeah.
3:48 3:49 MALE: So you're like regular into clubs and just-- 
3:56 4:12 FEMALE: Well, I don't actually, I mean, like I really do most of my dancing on campus.  Like there's like a lot of on campus stuff. I mean, I've done, I've gone salsa dancing a couple of times in the city, but like not that much.  I actually want to do that more, because it's fun, and it's very good to let [unintelligible][horn] get away.  She really needs to get a better sounding horn.
4:06 4:06 MALE: Yeah.
4:13 4:13 FEMALE: male306, right?
4:07 4:08 MALE: male306, yeah, it was good to meet you.
