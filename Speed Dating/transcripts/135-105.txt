FILE NAME: Male Speaker 105 -- Female Speaker 135


@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  I need a break.  
@0:02 0:03 MALE:  Yeah.  [laughter]  I can finish with this.  
@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  [laughter]  Okay, female135--go.  [laughter]
@0:14 0:15 MALE:  Sex break.
@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  [laughter]  
@0:24 0:25 MALE:  Now they're like, okay, back.  
@0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Exactly.  
@0:27 0:54 MALE:  My old job they used to do stretch breaks twice a day.  That was the most bizarre thing.  The best ones was when they had us do eye stretches.  Stare at your finger.  Stare at the wall.  Stare at your finger.  Stare at the wall.  Nothing like seeing about 40 engineers lined up staring at their finger.  [laughter]  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  I swear they had hidden cameras lying there so they could take pictures and then sell them on like somewhere--America's Funniest Home Videos.  
@0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  That's pretty good.  
@0:56 1:09 MALE:  But it definitely took some very motivated people.  It's like get up and stretch.  No.  Leave me alone.  I don't want to, and then it was always the whole guilting other people into it.  I'm not doing it unless he's doing it.  
@1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  Right.  Right.  I'm not going to be the only one.  
@1:11 1:15 MALE:  And then there were strategically placed coffee breaks that started taking place.  
@1:15 1:17 FEMALE:  That's an interesting company.  
@1:20 1:25 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, oh man, that was fun.  
@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  So, are you enjoying this?  
@1:28 1:29 MALE:  I actually am.  
@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, I--
@1:31 1:49 MALE:  [interposing]  I was really incredibly nervous when I walked in through the door, but fortunately I dragged a friend with me.  And it's like safety in numbers.  We're doing this.  It's like we'll commiserate about it afterwards if it goes badly.  And, uh, actually it's been going great.  Everyone has been like incredibly friendly and--
@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  [interposing]  [unintelligible].  
@1:51 1:57 MALE:  I like that, and it's a lot better than what I normally do on Thursday night, so.  
@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:00 2:49 MALE:  I don't know.  There was a period last year when talking to a friend of mine it was like, so, what have you been up to for the last three weeks?  Well, I was in the lab.  Then, I was in the library, and then I was in the lab again to the point where I changed the voicemail on my phone saying I'm in the library or in the lab. If you really want to get a hold of me, send me an e-mail.  And I'll get back to you in like two or three days. People didn't believe me.  They like left me--by the time I actually made it back to my phone because I like left it in my car, I had like 19 voice mail messages, 10 of them were not very friendly.  And when I finally called them back, I was like you didn't e-mail me.  You didn't listen to the voice mail.  They're like we didn't think you were serious.  Yes, I'm serious.  It's so--
@2:53 2:53 MALE 2:  [interposing]  Alright.  
2:53 2:54 MALE:  Hello.
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  Hello. [laughter]
2:54 2:55 MALE:  Go through the routine, male105.
0:05 0:05 FEMALE:  female135.  
2:57 3:07 MALE:  female135, I was like Carrie, female135.  So, you are either education--education?  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  
0:16 0:18 FEMALE:  But I'm different than the other education.  
3:08 3:09 MALE:  How so?  
0:18 0:21 FEMALE:  I'm doctoral, and most of the education here are Master's.  
3:12 3:12 MALE:  Right on.  
0:22 0:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:14 3:17 MALE:  My mom just finished her PhD in education last month.  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Cool, where?  
3:18 3:20 MALE: Uh, University of New Mexico.   So.
0:28 0:35 FEMALE:  Cool.  I was just reading something from a bunch of UNM people. But now, I can't remember what it was.  Anyway.  
3:26 3:45 MALE:  Yeah, I read her thesis several times to proof read it.  So, I know everything about longitudinal studies involving assessments for the literacy of elementary school students, and I don't know the technical term because I know there's a better way to say that.  But the word I learned out of it was longitudinal.  
0:54 0:56 FEMALE:  Longitudinal, yeah. Good, good research design.  
3:48 3:49 MALE:  And I learned how to use SPSS.  
0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Uh, Okay.  
3:51 3:51 MALE:  Which is something I will never admit to.  
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, not my favorite, but.
3:56 3:56 MALE:  So, what are you studying? 
1:06 1:14 FEMALE:  I study higher education, and my research is on college teaching and effective teaching styles and how graduate students learn to teach, and all that stuff.
4:07.0 4:18.1 MALE:  Who does that?  Um, a lady in mechanical engineering, Sherry Shepherd, um, does the same kind of stuff trying to figure out why we lose so many girls in engineering, 
1:27.1 1:27.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:18.6 4:27.3 MALE:  And, um, also the- the thing she was really concerned about is why is it that like 40 percent of all graduate students are not U.S. people.  
1:36.4 1:37.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah. 
4:27.1 4:34.0 MALE:  And so like trying to figure out ways to improve that.  And so, there's a lot of people like studying that.
1:42.4 1:42.9 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:34.5 4:35.3 MALE: So, that's a good thing.
1:44.4 1:44.8 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:35.8 4:40.7 MALE: I mean, otherwise, and like--society will implode, and bad things will happen and  it just won't be good.  
1:50 2:01 FEMALE:  I just feel like there's so much wasted time in college classes like where the students aren't getting anything out of it, the teachers are burnt out, you know, the professors are, totally, like, busy with 10,000 other things.  You know what I mean?  Like, I think there's a lot of--
4:53 4:58.1 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, you can tell the difference between a professor who is totally a research professor 
2:07.1 2:07.5 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:58.3 5:08.6 MALE: and a professor who is purely there for academic reasons.  And the problem is a lot of times the ones who are really academic, the ones you really click with, who really are interested in you, can't fund you for doing a PhD.
2:17.5 2:18.2  FEMALE: Right, Yes.
5:08.8 3:09.1 So you're like--
2:19.4 2:19.8 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
5:10.5 5:10.8 MALE:  Great.
2:20.6 2:21.2 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
5:11.9 5:20.0 MALE:  So. I don't know.  A good case study would be to look at the electrical engineers, you ask most of them, they'd say "I feel like a cog in the machine,"
2:29.2 2:29.6 FEMALE: Yeah.
5:20.0 5:21.6 MALE: "They just kind of crank us out."
2:30 2:30 FEMALE:  Right.
5:23 5:25  MALE:  So, good stuff.  So, along that--
2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  [laughter] So that's- you're an electrical engineer.  
5:26.5 5:27.3 MALE:  Oh, heavens no.  
2:36.3 2:36.9  FEMALE: No?
5:27.7 5:28.4  MALE: Heavens no.  
2:37.5 2:38.1  FEMALE: No?
5:29.7 5:31.9 They keep telling me I'm going to turn into one because--
2:40.5 2:42.0 FEMALE:  [laughter]
5:32.8 5:34.8 and I tell I- I deny it.   No.
2:43.2 2:45.7 FEMALE:  [laughter]
5:35.8 5:37.0 MALE: I'm a mechanical engineer,
2:45.9 2:46.3 FEMALE: Oh, ok.
5:37.0 5:38.0 MALE: And I'll stay that way.  
2:46.8 2:47.8 FEMALE:  [laughter]
5:38.7 5:43.9 MALE: No, because I do the controls, and so half of my classes are in electrical
engineering.  
2:52.8 2:53.1 FEMALE: Mm
5:44.4 5:56.3 MALE: Most of the people I know are electrical engineers.  And so actually I think to this point I've taken more EE classes and.  Like, my big design class for- for mechanical is all about the design with microcontrollers
3:05.2 3:05.6 FEMALE:  Mm-hmm
5:56.3 6:10.4 MALE: To get like robots to move around, and things to do fun stuff.  So, it's all electrical, so I tell my friends like this is like this is what I used to do in undergrad.  Only more of it, like the pride.   And "You're not a mechanical engineer".  I was like like "Oh, yes I am".  I'm not turning into one of you guys.  
3:19.2 3:20.5 FEMALE:  [laughter]
6:12.2 6:20.5 MALE: Will not!  I have a friend who is graduating this quarter, and he's like, no, you can't go into electrical engineering.  It will be the end of you.  Don't do it.  
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Lost another good one.  [laughter]
6:22 6:27.3  MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he mentions like critical numbers of like men and  then-
3:36.3 3:37.0 FEMALE:  [laughter]
6:28.1 6:40.0 MALE: There's actually one class I'm grading for this quarter, uh, auditorium, I think 150 guys probably, two girls.   [laughter]
3:46.5 3:50 FEMALE:  Wow.   Oh wow,
6:41.5 6:47.3 MALE:  Yeah, I think that's the most I've seen, and we're sitting here going wow, wow.  
3:56.1 3:57 FEMALE: Yeah
6:47.3 6:49.0 MALE: We didn't think this was possible.
3:58.5 4:00.8 FEMALE Wow, yeah.
6:49.8  6:57.4 MALE: Okay, okay. I don't know.  There's not many people in education though.  You guys are a pretty small department.   [horn]
4:08 4:09 FEMALE:  It was really nice to meet you.  
7:00 7:01 MALE:  Nice talking to you.
