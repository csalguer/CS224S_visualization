0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  How are you doing?
0:03 0:05 MALE:  Hi.  [laughter]  male111.
0:03 0:04 FEMALE: I'm female129.  
0:06 0:06 MALE:  Nice to meet you. 
0:04 0:06 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  How's your night going?
0:08 0:13 MALE:  Pretty good.  Like, I didn't-I feel like I'm a [unintelligible] person who keeps talking about myself.  
0:11 0:16 FEMALE:  I know.  It's a little embarrassing.  Somebody is going to listen to this and be like broken records.  
0:18 0:22 MALE:  I know.  I know it, yeah.  They'll be like, oh my gosh, they actually study that?  Like, that's so boring.  
0:21 0:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, I-yeah.  No, I hear you.  
0:26 0:29 MALE:  I'm also not used to speaking like to the sound of a horn.  
0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  That's true.  Or like in four-minute increments.  
0:31 0:34 MALE:  Right, it's going to be like haunting me like when I go to bed tonight.  
0:33 0:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Ready, honk?
0:36 0:40 MALE:  Like my alarm clock will be like--wait, my alarm clock will go out-
0:38 0:41 FEMALE:  [interposing]  It's fun though.  What else do you have to do with yourself on Thursday night?  
0:43 0:48 MALE:  It's pretty fun.  Yeah, it's-I mean I think it's like a pretty funny idea. Like, I thought it was-[unintelligible] the study made it all the more [unintelligible].  
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, intriguing.  
0:49 0:50 MALE:  Nothing like being a lab rat.
0:48 0:50 FEMALE:  Exactly, if it's for a good cause.  
0:52 0:53 MALE:  Right, right.  
0:51 0:51 FEMALE:  Might as well come out. 
0:53 0:54 MALE:  It's for science, right?  
0:53 0:53 FEMALE:  Right, yeah.  
0:55 0:57 MALE:  So what if we sound like idiots [unintelligible].
0:55 1:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  I'm actually in a class with nameX [unintelligible].  He kept mentioning it in class, and, you know, all of my friends in the class would like turn and look at me every time he said, you know, if you're single, come do it.  I'm like, okay fine.  
1:10 1:14 MALE:  Right, right, right.  But you're really here helping a friend and like the good of science, right?  So...
1:16 1:21 FEMALE:  Well, I mean I'm here under social pressure.  I'm here under why not?
1:23 1:24 MALE:  That's actually--those are all good reasons.  
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, they're fun.  [crosstalk]
1:26 1:28 MALE: So, you're in the psych department then?
1:26 1:27 FEMALE: No, the ed school.  
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Ed school, oh, okay. 
1:28 1:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, how about you?
1:30 1:31 MALE:  I'm political science.
1:29 1:29 FEMALE: Okay.  
1:32 1:35 MALE: I'm in the third year getting a PhD, or trying to get a PhD.  
1:34 1:40 FEMALE:  You'll get it.  Do people ever get like past a certain point and then not get the degree?  
1:43 1:46 MALE:  A few people do, but thankfully they're like--you know, we don't hear about them very often.  
1:44 1:45 FEMALE:  Few and far between.  
1:47 1:51 MALE:  They go out and sort of do things in the private sector, you know, making a lot of money.  
1:49 1:49 FEMALE: It really sucks.  
1:51 1:55 MALE:  Yeah, I think they're like--the main thing is like you've got to push early on.  
1:53 1:58 FEMALE: Yeah, absolutely.  I agree with you.  They probably counsel you out.
2:00 2:01 MALE:  Right, right.  
1:59 2:01 FEMALE:  Or if they're responsible about it, they counsel you out.  
2:04 2:09 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] talked about that like it's a small place, but people get lost in the cracks and stuff.  
2:07 2:07 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:09 2:15 MALE:  But I like it so far.  I mean like it's a fun place.  I mean it's just a nice relaxing place to study.  
2:13 2:15 FEMALE: Yeah, that's true. Where did you come--where were you before?  
2:17 2:23 MALE: I was in Washington working there.  I worked for Policy Place in Dupont Circle.  
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Fun.
2:23 2:27 MALE:  That was really great.  I loved it, yeah.  Before that, like I was in school.  
2:25 2:25 FEMALE: Where?
2:28 2:28 MALE:  At Harvard.  
2:26 2:27 FEMALE: Okay.
2:29 2:30 MALE: Yeah, that was nice.  
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: I just moved from Boston.  
2:31 2:33 MALE: You just moved from Boston?  
2:31 2:31 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:33 2:34 MALE: Oh wow what neighborhood?  
2:33 2:34 FEMALE:  I spent two years in Porter Square.
2:36 2:37 MALE:  Okay.
2:35 2:36 FEMALE: And then a year in Brookline.  
2:38 2:47 MALE:  Porter Square, there's a restaurant there I go to in Porter--was there--there's a little Spanish [unintelligible] place in Porter Square.  I can't remember the name of it now-[unintelligible] or something.  
2:45 2:46 FEMALE:  Dolly is [unintelligible].  
2:48 2:49 MALE:  That's right, okay.  
2:47 2:48 FEMALE:  It is good.  It was really good.  
2:50 2:51 MALE: Yeah, that was really good.  
2:49 3:03 FEMALE:  I actually-I live maybe a mile and a half from Inman, but that whole like that whole sort of chunk of Cambridge that's like between Porter Square and Harvard Square that's like not on Mass Ave managed to confuse me. 
3:05 3:05 MALE: Right.
3:03 3:09 FEMALE: I mean still I could get lost like a half mile from where I lived so I had no idea where I was.  Inman is like a big blur to me. 
3:11 3:12 MALE: So you just avoided that sort of [unintelligible].  
3:10 3:11 FEMALE: I would go like-
3:13 3:15 MALE: [interposing]  You would go and be like-
3:13 3:14 FEMALE: [interposing]  I would go and then come right home.
3:17 3:19 MALE:  I'm not going to like fancy that [unintelligible].  
3:17 3:19 FEMALE:  No way, it's like I'm too deep into Inman.  
3:22 3:23 MALE:  Right, you weren't coming out. 
3:21 3:33 FEMALE:  Seriously, I lived with my sister in that apartment in Porter, and I definitely called her on more than one occasion completely lost.  And she would be like, you know, make a left turn here and a right turn there, and [unintelligible].
3:35 3:37 MALE: You're like it doesn't look like anything. 
3:35 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was terrible. Actually, I worked in [unintelligible].  I was teaching way out-I mean Hopkins is like 30 miles from Porter.  
3:46 3:46 MALE: You were teaching there? 
3:44 3:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:47 3:48 MALE:  Oh cool. What grade?
3:47 3:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, second grade.  And I was great on the highways. 
3:51 3:52 MALE:  Right.
3:50 3:54 FEMALE:  I just couldn't get from Inman's to home.
3:54 3:59 MALE:  More than one person has told me the story about Inman's [unintelligible] being complete like that whole area [unintelligible].  
3:57 3:59 FEMALE: I don't know what it is, but it is.  It's very-
4:01 4:02 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, I'm glad you made it out okay. 
4:03 4:03 FEMALE: Me too.
4:03 4:04 MALE: It was nice meeting you, female129.  Take care.
