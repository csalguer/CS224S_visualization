0:38 0:38 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Oh, so you took the other -- 
0:40 0:40 MALE:  [unintelligible].

0:42 0:43 MALE:  Oh, I loved it.
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Yeah?
0:43 0:45 MALE:  I thought I was a bad public speaker, but then after the class I felt -
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  Better about it?
0:48 0:50 MALE:  Better about it, and you know, the confidence can make a big difference.
0:50 0:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, so have you taken a lot of those -- those -- like I took a negotiations class in that same area too, have you taken that one?
0:59 0:59 MALE:  Do you recommend it?
1:00 1:07 FEMALE:  I love nameX is great.  He's like one of my favorite people ever.  He's like a great professor, so I definitely recommend. 
1:07 1:09 MALE:  So what do you gain from the class?
1:10 1:24 FEMALE:   Um, I mean negotiations is, since I'm in business, it's just very you know, germane to what I'm doing, so.  But just the way he goes about it I think is very smart, you know, not like adversarial but -
1:24 1:24 MALE:  Are you in the MBA program?
1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:24 1:24 MALE:  Okay.

1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  Another MBA. 
1:30 1:30 MALE:  Okay.  
1:31 1:51 FEMALE:  Um, so yeah, so um, it just made a lot of sense for what I was doing, but the way he goes about it and the stories that he has, like he's done -- he's like negotiated with rebels in Columbia and he's done all this crazy stuff, so it was just a good story and um -- yeah, so I would recommend it if you have a chance.
1:51 1:53 MALE:  Yeah, I've heard a lot about [unintelligible] he's an [unintelligible].
1:54 1:59 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, just um, by trade or he just is that way?
1:59 1:59 MALE:  [unintelligible].

2:07 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:07 2:10 MALE:  What kinds of things do you do for fun?
2:11 2:16 FEMALE:  Um, right now we do a lot of just sitting around and drinking wine and hanging out.
2:17 2:18 MALE:  Oh, that's right, that's good, MBA.
2:19 2:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  It's one of those -- MBA's are all about relationships and meeting people and that kind of thing.  So, yeah, so I feel like that's what we do a lot of.
2:27 2:27 MALE:  Right.
2:28 2:39 FEMALE:  Some of us are you know, only in California for a couple years, so trying to see everything around here and we take vacations and -

2:56 2:58   FEMALE:  Yeah, I think that's a -
2:58 2:58 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:58 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, I picked up -- very smart -- I picked up most us learn that.  The people that don't learn it in business school don't have as much fun [laughter].
