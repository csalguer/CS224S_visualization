0:53 0:53 FEMALE: Okay, yeah, sure.  
0:54 0:58 MALE: So when we'd go to these like red places or whatever, and then we'd leave 'em, and you go, holler, and--
0:59 0:59 FEMALE: [laughter]
0:59 1:03 MALE: Who are you talking to?  How do you know this?  But they were trying to, they were saying something else.

1:10 1:10 MALE: [laughter]  
1:11 1:11 FEMALE: [laughter] Okay.
1:11 1:17 MALE: [unintelligible] We were like, "This is awesome," like urban American culture.
1:17 1:18 FEMALE: It's there, I know.  [laughter]
1:18 1:19 MALE: [unintelligible]
1:20 1:29 FEMALE: A lot of it has invaded, I mean, like probably 90 percent of movies in the theaters are American, 80 percent of the shows on TV are American, so like it probably, I think probably lots of people spoke English, I would imagine.
1:29 1:31 MALE: Oh, yeah, it was, it was really [unintelligible]
1:31 1:32 FEMALE: I'm sure it was easy, over there.
1:32 1:33 MALE: Really beautiful country, like--
1:33 1:34 FEMALE: Yeah, it's gorgeous.
1:34 1:34 MALE: It was great.
1:34 1:36 FEMALE: Yeah, it's gorgeous, yeah.  How did you end up going there?
1:36 1:39 MALE: Um, I just, I started in Spain, got to Italy.
1:38 1:39 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
1:40 1:41 MALE: And then we just kept on going.
1:41 1:42 FEMALE: Nice.  [laughter]
1:42 1:42 MALE: I was like, alright.  
1:43 1:45 FEMALE: This is good?  Let's see more of it.  Okay.
1:46 1:47 MALE: [unintelligible] overnight--
1:48 1:48 FEMALE: The ferries.
1:48 1:48 MALE: Yeah.
1:49 1:49 FEMALE: Okay.
1:49 1:51 MALE: And those like kill me, but like once you get there--
1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Right, it's gorgeous.
1:53 1:53 MALE: It was great.
1:54 2:28 FEMALE: It's cool because like I actually, a couple friends of mine and I were traveling a couple years ago, and we did a similar thing because we went to like Spain and you know, France, and Italy, and then also like we took the ferry.  And like it was such a nice contrast because the ferry was leaving from Bari [phonetic], like you know, it's kind of like a not very nice port, like kind of just like, this nasty town in Italy.  And then like we made it to Dubrovnik, it's just like, beautiful, and it's like, you know, this like pearl on the coast, and it's like, "Yay, thank god we're here" you know, so, yeah.  I think my friends liked it a lot, actually.  Like they said, they've seen, they'd seen a lot of Europe at that point, they said that Croatia's definitely high on their list of like favorite places, so, it's cool.
2:29 2:29 MALE: So what are you doing here?
2:30 2:32 FEMALE: I'm an M.D./Ph.D. student, so [unintelligible]
2:32 2:33 MALE: [unintelligible] 
2:33 2:34 FEMALE: Yes.
2:34 2:36 MALE: So you like school.  You like school--
2:36 2:37 FEMALE: So it would seem.
2:37 2:38 MALE: --a lot.  
2:38 2:42 FEMALE: Well, at least, I'm willing to stay in school more than most people, maybe.
2:43 2:43 MALE: Wow.  
2:44 2:44 FEMALE: So, yeah.
2:44 2:45 MALE: So what do you like specifically?  
2:46 2:48 FEMALE: About school or what am I-- what am I doing at-- ?
2:47 2:48 MALE: [unintelligible] yeah, yeah.
2:48 3:00 FEMALE: Um, so Ph.D. will be neuroscience, and-- yeah, M.D. is just M.D.  I mean, I'll probably go eventually into like academic medicine, like neurology or psychiatry, or something to that effect, and do medical research.  
3:00 3:00 MALE: Sure.
3:01 3:10 FEMALE: That's the plan.  We'll see if it can happen.  Things may very well change, because by the time I'm done, you know, it'll be like at least six years from now, so you know, what happens.  How about yourself?  What do you do?
3:10 3:11 MALE: I'm in business school.
3:11 3:14 FEMALE: Okay, very cool.  Like everyone here.
3:14 3:15 MALE: [unintelligible] school.
3:16 3:23 FEMALE: That you guys are comfortable with meeting people within four minutes because you think you'll leave a good enough impression, and that you don't meet a lot of people otherwise.
3:24 3:24 MALE: Yeah--
3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Probably.
3:25 3:25 MALE: --right.  
3:26 3:27 FEMALE: That'd be my guess.  [unintelligible]
3:27 3:28 MALE: [unintelligible] business school.

3:34 3:37 MALE: Yeah, we do.  It kind of gets old after a while, you know--
3:38 3:38 FEMALE: Right, I'm sure.
3:38 3:41 MALE: Between getting drunk every, you know, every Friday, it's like--
3:42 3:43 FEMALE: So I've been there, done that.
3:43 3:46 MALE: Yeah, I mean, I'm old, you know, that's like a [unintelligible]
