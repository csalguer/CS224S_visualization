0:56 1:15 MALE:  Yes, I was on a back road in Kentucky and I was, I was on my motorcycle trip and I hit a really bad patch of road and I went down and, and sort of had to put myself back together and fix the bike and then like finally found a road side diner and I walked in, and you been in an accident, I was like yeah.  
1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:16 1:19 MALE:  Anybody have a pair of pliers and like three guys in overalls brought out vice grips from their pockets.

1:26 1:28 FEMALE:  It is, that's my, my state, yeah.  [laughter] 
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Very nice.  
1:29 1:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, a little quaint.  I mean it's like, where I'm from it's a really small town, so it's kind of boring, you know, like nothing to do, I don't really want to live there.  There's no jobs, but it was really fun and like, in some ways it's beautiful, nature, it's really pretty.  You can go out in the yard and yell as loud as you want and nobody can hear you.  And you know--
1:45 1:46 MALE:  I had the opposite experience in New York, believe it or not.  
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Okay, did you grow up in New York City?  
1:49 1:49 MALE:  Long Island. 
1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  Long Island? 
1:51 1:53 MALE:  Uh, yeah, it's Long Island.  That's how it's pronounced. 
1:54 1:54 FEMALE:  I've never been there, so I--
1:55 2:11 MALE:  Yeah, I know, that's the accent that people make fun of.  So um, no, but um, but as soon as I was off to school, my folks moved into the city, and then so whenever I was coming home from school it was in the city, and then I lived there for two years before I came over here.  So, yeah, I'm pretty much from the city. 
2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, people make fun my accent. 
2:14 2:15 MALE:  Accent?  
2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  So.  [laughter] 
2:16 2:16 MALE:  I know. My mom was from Connecticut, my dad was from Brooklyn, so they cancelled out.  So I don't, yeah.  
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:21 2:22 MALE:  Nobody can ever tell where I'm from.  It's kind of nice.  
2:23 2:24 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:25 2:26 MALE:  Except I talk really fast because I'm an East Coaster.  So anyway.   
2:27 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Some people say like, that I have a really strong accent, and then some people are like oh what accent.  And I'm like oh wait you haven't heard me say a certain syllable yet, like it's only certain sounds that really like, people are where are you from? 
2:42 2:43 MALE:  Does it come out more when you drink? 
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  Probably.  
2:45 2:45 MALE:  I talk faster and yeah. 
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  Probably yeah. 
2:47 2:48 MALE:  Start talking like my grandfather from Brooklyn, it's really weird. 
2:49 2:52 FEMALE:  [laughter] What do you study? 
2:53 2:54 MALE:  I'm in education and I'm studying technologies in education. 
2:55 2:58 FEMALE:  You're the first guy that's not been like an engineer or science, something like that. 
2:59 3:00 MALE:  Really, because like half the joint is like Ed school people.   
3:01 3:03 FEMALE:  Only the women, because that's who you been talking to.  [laughter] 
3:04 3:05 MALE:  There aren't any guys -- that's true -- there aren't any guys in the Ed school.   
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  [laughter] No. 
3:06 3:07 MALE:  Which should be to my favor, but--
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:08 3:09 MALE:  --yeah, there's no dating in the Ed school.  
3:10 3:11 FEMALE:  Okay.  [laughter] 
3:11 3:12 MALE:  Except right here.  So yeah.   
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  It's weird, isn't it?

3:30 3:30 MALE:  One of my friend's here, her roommate is in linguistics.  
3:31 3:31 FEMALE:  Really? 
3:31 3:32 MALE:  Is it a big program? 
3:33 3:39 FEMALE:  It is, but I mean it's not a big program, I should know someone, maybe it's like anthropological linguistics or something different.  I don't know if [unintelligible], it doesn't sound familiar.  
3:40 3:42 MALE:  I'm not really sure. I wish I knew more about the field so I could say. 
3:43 3:46 FEMALE:  Yeah. [laughter] Anyway, I don't know.  So what are you going to do when you finish? 
3:47 3:48 MALE:  No idea. 
3:48 3:48 FEMALE:  No idea.  
3:48 3:48 MALE:  Probably consulting of some kind.   
3:49 3:49 FEMALE:  Okay. 
3:50 3:56 MALE:  I was doing that before I came here, and I really enjoyed the consulting market.  And so, I just don't on what.  Some aspect of technology---
3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:59 4:03 MALE: --um, some aspect of education, maybe, I don't know.  I came to the Ed school because I like learning--
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
4:05 4:09 MALE:  --and I like education.  I don't like kids, so I'll probably go do something in the industry.  Yeah, I don't know.  
4:10 4:12 FEMALE:  Okay, okay.  
           [horn]
