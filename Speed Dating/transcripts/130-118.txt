FILE NAME: Male Speaker 118 -- Female Speaker 130

0:02 0:13 MALE:  Hi, my name is male118.  Nice to meet you, female130.  [unintelligible].  [Crosstalk]  So, what's your major here?  
0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  Philosophy. 
0:15 0:20 MALE:  Philosophy, all right, I'm doing aeronautics and astronautics out of the engineering department.  
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Well, that's impressive.  
0:21 0:30 MALE:  Well, I don't know.  Everything's impressive if you haven't done it.  I don't know, philosophy is impressive to me.  I know nothing about philosophy.  So...
0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  What do you do in aeronautics?  
0:34 0:56 MALE:  Uh, I don't know.  We do--well, the stuff that I'm interested in is most like controlling like the attitude and position of like space crafts in orbit.  That would be like what I would be most interested in working at a time like in industry.  What, uh, what's like your focus and philosophy?  Or like where are you?  
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  Self perception.  
0:58 0:59 MALE:  Self perception.  
0:58 1:09 FEMALE:  How we are not in a vacuum, and how psychologists are interested in [unintelligible] so, so.  How to [unintelligible] why we are who we are.  
1:11 1:12 MALE:  Oh, yeah, that's pretty interesting.  
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  The big questions.  
1:13 1:19 MALE:  Yeah, the huge questions.  Do you do like--I don't know how that program works for philosophy.  Is there like a lot of research, or?  
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:21 1:25 MALE:  Do you like--is it similar to like psych experiments, kind of?  
1:24 1:32 FEMALE:  Uh, no.  I can't.  I would like to use some psych experiments in my dissertation, but it's not something that I [unintelligible] to get.  
1:38 1:45 MALE:  So what traditionally does like the research encompass for like philosophy [unintelligible]?  
1:43 1:45 FEMALE:  You read [unintelligible] over.  
1:48 1:53 MALE:  It's just kind of like compiling other work and kind of like expressing it.  
1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  It is a whole idea.  
1:54 2:00 MALE:  Taking [unintelligible] like unify--like a new theory or something.  
1:58 2:10 FEMALE: You also try to [unintelligible], for instance, you have to [unintelligible] so it's [unintelligible] is right.  
2:12 2:13 MALE:  All right.  
2:11 2:16 FEMALE:  You get the nature right, and you'll have some idea.  And you--merely it's an argument.  
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Right.  
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  Why it's right, or why it's wrong.  
2:22 2:30 MALE:  So then you do a lot of research on that topic, and then you present your findings, and your opinions, and stuff in some type of paper?  
2:28 2:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:31 2:32 MALE:  All right.  
2:30 2:35 FEMALE:  So, it's [unintelligible] the problems are very vague, very--
2:38 2:42 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, depending on who it is I'm sure you'll get different--
2:41 2:43 FEMALE: [interposing]  Opinions.  Well, they have to be well-argued.  
2:46 2:50 MALE:  Yeah, you can't just arbitrarily just say that this is what you think.  
2:48 3:05 FEMALE: [unintelligible] try to be more, I'm interested in politics for instance to [unintelligible] what I think in voice-making.  They go into [unintelligible] and they try to make policies.  So, you can do that.  
3:07 3:15 MALE:  A lot of like political--do, uh, are you interested in getting a job similar to that, or more like in academia?  
3:14 3:19 FEMALE: Before academia.  This is what I think [unintelligible].  
3:21 3:22 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:20 3:21 FEMALE: What do you want to do?  
3:24 3:49 MALE:  I probably just want to finish up with my Master's and then just get a job in industry somewhere and work for one of the larger aerospace companies and just see what it's like, perhaps.  I haven't really done that much actual work.  I mean I've learned all of this stuff, and I'd just like to see it--see how it applies to real problems and I don't know--
3:50 3:53 FEMALE:  [interposing]  It's better that you can have a job, you know, that's right away.  
3:56 4:03 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, it was nice talking to you.
