0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  That's not bad, okay.  

0:38 0:38 MALE:  No, that's not bad at all.  

0:53 0:56 FEMALE:  Do you know like, like where you want to be after that?  

0:42 0:51 MALE:  Not really.  Well yeah I do.  I know what I want to do.  Like I want to work with medical devices and making them.  And I'm psyched right now because I have an internship for this summer doing that.  

1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  That's very cool.  

0:52 0:54 MALE:  Because it's not what I do now, but it's what I plan to do.  

1:09 1:11 FEMALE:  It's going to be on campus?  

0:58 1:00 MALE:  It's going to be at Adjuvent [phonetic], which is a company like around the corner.  

1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Oh okay, very cool.  

1:02 1:02 MALE:  How about you?  

1:17 1:21 FEMALE:  Oh I'm a Masters student in the Education School, so I have half my classes here.  

1:06 1:08 MALE:  Right on.  So you're drafted, you have to be here right?  

1:23 1:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, I know it's a little -- but it's okay you know.  Right.  

1:12 1:16 MALE:  All right so this is like the School of Ed girls and engineering guys.  

1:30 1:37 FEMALE:  [laughter] and like engineering guys right.  Isn't that the way it always -- no I'm kidding.  So yeah, how'd you get dragged into this anyway?  

1:23 1:23 MALE:  How did I get dragged?  

1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

1:24 1:24 MALE:  Well I just dragged myself.  

1:39 1:40 FEMALE:  Really?  

1:25 1:30 MALE:  Because I mean I'm single and I meet lots of people in the city, but you know, it's kind of far away.  

1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  Do you live in the city?  

1:31 1:32 MALE:  No I live down here.  

1:47 1:47 FEMALE:  Okay, okay.  

1:34 1:37 MALE:  But just like a lot of my friends are up there, like I go up there every weekend and stuff.  

1:52 1:55 FEMALE:  Okay I'm from the city actually.  Yeah so like where do you hang out and stuff?  

1:43 1:44 MALE:  I like the [unintelligible] a lot.  

1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah so do I, yeah.  

1:45 1:47 MALE:  Yeah.  I like the blue hair.  

2:01 2:08 FEMALE:  Oh it's growing out.  I was saying, I want to dye it back, but I have to look for a job, so I'm debating whether it would be a good idea or not.  

1:54 1:54 MALE:  Probably not.  

2:09 2:19 FEMALE:  But you know, we'll see.  There's a [unintelligible] I love hanging out there, but it's like, the group in the city like Mission is like, did not always used to be like that and so --  

2:05 2:05 MALE:  What was it like before?  

2:20 2:25 FEMALE:  I mean it's a little working class neighborhood, like you know, kind of like at night not the best area.  

2:10 2:12 MALE:  Didn't have like the bars and stuff?  

2:27 2:34 FEMALE:  No.  And so it feels a little bit strange now, but it was one of the nicer areas to hang out now, I have to admit.  So, yeah.  

2:20 2:22 MALE:  Yeah.  Do you live up there?  Like currently.  

2:36 2:39 FEMALE:  No I live on campus, actually I live on campus.  I don't have a car or anything so --  

2:25 2:26 MALE:  Oh that sucks.  

2:40 2:53 FEMALE:  It really -- it's ironic feeling, oh I'm [unintelligible] I can't chase you guys and meet [unintelligible] I don't have anything.  But you know it's all right.  It gives me a chance to like explore the Bay area a little bit because like growing up in the city I was kind of a city snob.  

2:38 2:41 MALE:  Do you have a way to get around, you just get around with friends and stuff?  

2:55 3:00 FEMALE:  Well I have friends who have cars, so it's not so bad after all I guess.  I haven't gone to [unintelligible], it's still a little bit.  

2:48 2:54 MALE:  Yeah, I mean I don't know, I mean I don't mind Palo Alto, I don't mind living here.  It's just not my favorite place in the world
  
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] is supposed to be four years too, like   

2:57 3:03 MALE:  Yeah, like going out in Palo Alto is nothing and like cultural activities, like if they're there I haven't found them as well.  

3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  No that's true, that's true so --  

3:06 3:06 MALE:  But, I don't want to bitch.  

3:22 3:26 FEMALE:  I know, exactly because everyone keeps saying the same thing about Palo Alto.  So it's true.  

3:10 3:12 MALE:  Yeah, but you're from the city?  

3:27 3:28 FEMALE:  I am.  Where are you from actually?  

3:14 3:14 MALE:  Pennsylvania.  

3:29 3:31 FEMALE:  Okay like, are you near Pittsburgh or --  

3:17 3:17 MALE:  Philly.  

3:32 3:39 FEMALE:  Oh Philly.  I went to Philly once last summer for like a half a day.  We ate cheese steaks.  

3:25 3:26 MALE:  Nice.  Where?  

3:41 3:46 FEMALE:  So -- oh we went to two places, we want to Pat's and Gino's.  

3:32 3:38 MALE:  Okay those are the most famous and I've never been to either, so what do you say about them?  Because I get them at another place.  

3:51 4:06 FEMALE:  Okay I like Pat's better than Gino's because they cut up the steak into really small pieces and Gino's does not, which I did not like, but it could have been because I was really full after we ate Pat's and we're like, but I heard there was a place on South Street that's really good too, Ginny's.  

3:52 3:55 MALE:  That's where I always go.  I'm always on South Street.  

4:08 4:19 FEMALE:  Okay, well we wanted to go there.  Yeah South Street seems like a really cool area actually.  I think like if I lived there I'd hang out there all the time.  But we were too full to eat.  We were too full by the time we got to Ginny's so we couldn't try it.  

4:05 4:06 MALE:  Well come on, you had two cheese steaks already.  

4:21 4:23 FEMALE:  That would have been good, we had [unintelligible] though water ice.  

4:09 4:11 MALE:  I talked to her about cheese steak.  

4:26 4:28 FEMALE:  Hey man, it's awesome.  All right.  

4:14 4:19 MALE:  So do you guys -- what was my question?  I forgot, never mind, something about the Ed School.
