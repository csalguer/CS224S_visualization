FILE NAME: Male Speaker 102 -- Female Speaker 135

0:01 0:03 FEMALE:  Way too short a time.  Like, a minute is way too hard.  
0:03 0:21 MALE:  It's--not only that, but I feel like the scales are such that there are so many gradations like what makes something a seven, versus a six, versus an eight?  It's hard.  I took a survey design course.  
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  Oh, did you take [unintelligible]? 
0:22 0:27 MALE:  Yes, I took it last quarter, and it was very good to sort of help weed out things like that.  And they're going to listen to all this.
0:29 0:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, nameX and nameX's course.  It's awesome.  
0:31 0:34 MALE:  It's really good, and it will help make the survey even better.  
0:36 0:47 FEMALE:  I really liked it, and you know that survey [unintelligible].  So, then I took nameX and nameX's thing, and I'm like, oh, this is all crap.  I'm going to totally redo it differently now.  
0:47 0:55 MALE:  You know, what's so interesting too is I'm sitting on this other committee that's like looking at research methods across the university.  Did I mention that?  
0:56 0:58 FEMALE:  Not the one for just the ed school, but the whole?  
0:57 1:45 MALE:  Not the one for just the ed school.  This is one that's actually being sponsored by male102 Croznik, but it's across the whole university.  They're like trying to survey all of the research methods, classes across, you know, poli sci, sociology, economics, education, and what's interesting is there are tons of classes on analysis particularly quantitative analysis.  In fact, a lot of the same classes are offered in a lot of different departments. Then there's like a handful of classes on data collection, just a very, very few that focus on that.  And male102 Croznik's is one of them, and what's so interesting is your analysis is only as good as your data collection.  You would think there would be a little bit more--I mean supposedly you're just supposed to get this one.  Maybe it's just supposed to be so obvious, but it's so not obvious.  
1:46 1:46 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:46 2:03 MALE:  And there's very few courses on either research design or like theoretical foundations of research, which is kind of what I'm interested in.  And so it's just very bizarre how it's all spread out.  So, hopefully one of the things that comes out of this group is to sort of push for a little bit more variety and balance in the different classes that are offered.  
2:05 2:16 FEMALE:  I was just looking today at [unintelligible] and responses on research design class, and it was the best class I've ever had in grad school.  It was so mind blowingly awesome, and you know--
2:16 2:18 MALE:  This is here, or this is at--okay, this is [unintelligible]? 
2:20 2:48 FEMALE:  But it wasn't like--I mean there were a lot of poli sci [unintelligible].  It could have been offered in any social science.  It was just like--there was a leap on time, and like instead of learning how to do a net history or something we would like--we sat down, and we're like, okay, what is science and social research.  Is it like does time mean growth?  Does time mean history?  Does time mean cohort?  Does time mean--like, what are all the way is that time could play a role?  And what are the assumptions you're making when you use time?  
2:47 2:48 MALE:  That sounds really good.  
2:50 3:02 FEMALE:  What happens with time.  I was just sitting there just like, whoah, you know, like I would never--you know, when you look at a longitudinal study, you don't think is it a--you know, is it an age affect, a cohort affect, a developmental affect, you know, like.  
3:01 3:15 MALE:  Yep.  I'm taking a class now on rational choice theory, and it's all--it's doing a similar sort of thing.  Let's all think about what something means to be rational and what--you know, just because there are multiple rational courses of action?  And the indecision and--
3:17 3:19 FEMALE: Who is doing that?  
3:18 3:24 MALE:  nameX.  He is like right now the sole political theory guy in campus in poli sci.  
3:25 3:30 FEMALE: Oh, okay, so even the political theorist is teaching rational choice.  [crosstalk]
3:29 3:32 MALE:  But it's obviously from a more critical perspective.  
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:33 3:40 MALE:  And it's also very philosophical.  We're reading a lot of male102 Elser's [phonetic] stuff.  I don't know if you're familiar with Elser at all, but--
3:42 3:42 FEMALE:  [interposing]  A little.  
3:42 3:56 MALE:  Elser, Donald Davidson, you know, folks like that.  So, it's been really interesting, but the funny thing is it's like one of the very few classes offered in this area, and there are like three of us.  Switch.  
3:59 4:00 FEMALE: It sounds really good though.  
4:00 4:16 MALE:  It's a good course, and it's really useful for some of the things I'm interested in.  But it's also very like really dense sort of difficult to sort through sort of reading.  So, that's why.  Have fun.  
4:17 4:18 FEMALE:  It was lovely to meet you, Don.  
4:17 4:25 MALE:  It was lovely meeting you too, female135.  Have fun.  Enjoy the rest of your evening.  That was the horn, right?  
4:27 4:28 MALE:  That was the horn, guys, yeah.
