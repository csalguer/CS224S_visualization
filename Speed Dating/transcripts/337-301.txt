2:41 2:42 MALE:  And what kind of things do you do for fun?

2:42 2:50 FEMALE:  I'm not athletic at all, so I usually just like hang out with friends, and dining out, eating, chit-chatting, watching movies, TV and--

2:50 2:51 MALE:  What's a good movie you've seen recently?

2:51 2:59 FEMALE:  Um, well, the last one I saw would be--I think Ray is pretty entertaining.

3:00 3:00 MALE:  Ray?

3:01 3:01 FEMALE:  Ray.

3:01 3:02 MALE:  Oh, yeah, I've heard that too.  I really wanted to go see that actually.

3:03 3:04 FEMALE:  It's entertaining, yeah.  

3:05 3:05 MALE:  Yeah.

3:05 3:11 FEMALE:  I--I saw it on DVD, so it's not in the theater, so I don't know whether with a surround sound [unintelligible] would that be more entertaining then.

3:11 3:18 MALE:  Really.  They're really getting him to play [unintelligible] next--they're getting him to play another famous singer.  I can't remember.

3:18 3:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But that one's like I think more entertaining.  But I do enjoy a lot, um, Eternal Sunshine of the Thoughtless Mind have you seen that one?

3:26 3:28 MALE:  That's one of my favorite movies.  I really like it.

3:28 3:29 FEMALE:  I like it, yeah.

3:29 3:32 MALE:  So I saw that last spring in the theater.  It was great.  It kind of took me by surprise.  I didn't know what it was going to be about at all. 

3:32 3:37 FEMALE:  Yeah.  That's the kind of movie I actually like, so I was like [unintelligible] like club or um Humento [phonetic].

3:37 3:38 MALE:  So, you like those kind of [unintelligible] surprises.  Yeah, yeah, 'cause it makes you think a little bit, yeah.

3:38 3:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Just like a lot of twists.  It's not like the big formular movie 'cause I'm not like really--I--I'll watch one, but I just--I don't think it's as great as like things like that with a twist and just like not sure what's going on next.

3:51 3:53 MALE:  Yeah, it was clever.  They're all--all three of those are good examples of kind of clever movies.

3:53 3:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:54 4:00 MALE:  Where they--it  kind of make you think.  Like Eternal Sunshine of the Thoughtless Mind, coming home after the movie you like--you talk to the people in you car like for along about it like what's going on, what, I mean, would you do that.

4:00 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.

4:01 4:02 MALE:  Would you do that, does that make sense?

4:02 4:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, when you're watching it, it's like oh, what's going on, like what was that.  I--I enjoy that.

4:06 4:06 MALE:  Exactly.  Yeah that's kind of fun.
