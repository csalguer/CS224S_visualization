0:01 0:05 MALE:  This is like 10 times worse sitting over here.
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, how is this going for you?
0:07 0:13 MALE:  It's been alright.  It's kind of repetitive I'd say maybe.  I don't know.
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  I know.  I'm starting to have the same conversation.
0:15 0:15 MALE:  Yeah.
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  So I'm sure I'm not getting to know people has much.
0:17 0:22 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  I'm sick of hearing myself say the same things each time.
0:23 0:25 FEMALE:  I know.  [unintelligible].
0:26 0:26 MALE:  Really?
0:27 0:27 FEMALE:  Do you know what I mean?
0:30 0:49 MALE:  Yeah, there's one girl I was exciting over there and you know asked me like why are you single.  That was probably the most entertaining one.  Not necessarily like the one I'd most want to have the next date with, but definitely the most different and entertaining one.
0:50 0:53 FEMALE:  I know.  I've been having the standard same conversation.
0:53 0:59 MALE:  Yeah.  Uh huh.  Yeah, I mean I'm getting pretty tired.
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  I know.  I'm tired.
1:01 1:05 MALE:  I'm sick of talking and I'm kind of running out of steam here.
1:07 1:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, me, too.   I don't feel like I'm getting to know people enough to be a good judge.
1:14 1:27 MALE:  Really I think they give you the pieces [unintelligible].  I think I'm pretty much [unintelligible] physically attraction by now.  It can't hurt to tell them myself.
1:29 1:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, me, too.  I kind of think I am, too.  I'll probably [unintelligible] if I see them around you know because I'm meeting people now.
1:37 1:38 MALE:  Yeah, uh huh.
1:39 1:42 FEMALE:  I know I'm not really necessarily [unintelligible].
1:43 1:45 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  Do the formal date stuff.
1:48 1:51 MALE:  Yeah.  It's been an interesting experience.
1:55 1:57 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  [laughter]
2:00 2:02 MALE:  What do you do in Genetics?
2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  I do like skiing.
2:02 2:05 MALE:  Skiing, okay.  You got the skiing.
2:05 2:10 FEMALE:  Well, if they've been to Colorado, I ask what are your favorite ski resorts.  
2:10 2:10 MALE:  Uh huh.
2:10 2:15 FEMALE:  I mean I have my favorites, but then they say oh why haven't you been to Tahoe?  Well, it's a long drive.
2:16 2:16 MALE:  Uh huh.
2:17 2:25 FEMALE:  How can you be a skier and not go to Tahoe?  I say I haven't done any skiing since high school.  [unintelligible].  
2:25 2:26 MALE:  Yeah.
2:27 2:29 FEMALE:  How can you like skiing and not have been [unintelligible].
2:30 2:36 MALE:  Uh huh.  I haven't been quite attacked like that.
2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  Oh, it's not attacked --
2:38 2:39 MALE:  No, I'm joking.
2:40 2:43 FEMALE:  But, it's more than one person saying it to me, though.
2:43 2:44 MALE:  Uh huh.  Okay.
2:45 2:52 FEMALE:  If you're from Colorado, you must be an avid skier.  If you live in California, it must be wonderful, but now you're four hours away from the mountains.
2:52 2:52 MALE:  Yeah.
2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:54 2:59 MALE:  Uh huh.  [laughter]  Yeah.  That's a good point.
3:02 3:03 FEMALE:  How are you liking the girls?
3:03 3:04 MALE:  They're alright.
3:05 3:06 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:07 3:09 MALE:  Being nice, yeah.  What do you think overall?
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  There's a lot of engineers.
3:15 3:22 MALE:  Yeah.  I haven't seen many of them.  I've seen mainly Med School most and Law School quite a bit.
3:25 3:27 FEMALE:  Probably because they're from [unintelligible].
3:27 3:34 MALE:  Yeah, and that's where a lot of girls in Med School.  They're more likely to be at this stuff.
3:36 3:41 FEMALE:  Well you're the only Genetics person I met.  [unintelligible].
3:44 3:50 MALE:  Yeah.  Well, have you been talking into your tape recorder?
3:52 3:53 FEMALE:  No.
3:54 3:59 MALE:  Well I think there's only two or three left here.
4:00 4:02 FEMALE:  Oh, are you almost terrified?
4:02 4:02 MALE:  Yeah.
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Okay.
4:04 4:04 MALE:  Yeah, I'm almost done.
4:07 4:07 FEMALE:  Okay cool.  See you.
