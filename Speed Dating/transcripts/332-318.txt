0:02 0:03 MALE: Hi, I'm Jiben [phonetic].
0:02 0:02 FEMALE: female332.  [horn]
0:03 0:11 MALE: Hi, female332.  So, um, I'm getting [unintelligible] in EE and a Ph.D. in physics.
0:11 0:13 FEMALE: Oh, wow, cool.  Okay.
0:12 0:13 MALE: Uh, I work on medical physics.
0:14 0:14 FEMALE: On which?
0:16 0:16 MALE: Medical physics.
0:16 0:16 FEMALE: Medical.  
0:17 0:19 MALE: Have you heard of uh, x-ray, MRs.
0:18 0:19 FEMALE: Oh, yeah, yeah.
0:20 0:22 MALE: Uh, my work is to combine them.
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: X-ray and MRI.
0:23 0:24 MALE: Yeah.
0:23 0:25 FEMALE: Wow, how- how does that work?
0:26 1:08 MALE: So, uh, So, then this MRIs kinda special, so it's like uh, two- two donuts put together, so there's a gap in between, and uh, the doctor have access to the patient while the being imaged, and don't waste extra x-ray to some in between.  So, the doctor has ano- additional option to use x-rays, um, that my-- that can be very beneficial for some [unintelligible] procedures, 'cause a x-ray's very- um, very good at uh, getting images sharper images for that kind of devices, like [unintelligible] or- or tubes.
1:08 1:13 FEMALE: Okay.  So, so this is something that you use during a procedure, or just for-- ?
1:13 1:13 MALE: Yeah.
1:13 1:14 FEMALE: --for assessment.  Okay.  
1:15 1:16 MALE: For-- during the procedure.  
1:16 1:24 FEMALE: Wow.  So, the-- is the x-ray like part of the machine, or is it- it's used in that gap between the- the tube?
1:25 1:29 MALE: It's uh, it's basically integrated into the MRI system.
1:29 1:35 FEMALE: Okay, okay.  But the- but the gap between the two donuts is- is so that the doctor can access the patient?  
1:36 1:38 MALE: Yeah, it's meant, yeah, it's meant for the doctor's access.
1:36 1:38 FEMALE: Okay.  Wow.  
1:42 1:42 MALE: So what do you do?
1:42 1:43 FEMALE: Um, I'm in the biology department.  
1:44 1:44 MALE: Uh-huh.
1:44 1:45 FEMALE: I study plants.
1:46 1:46 MALE: Plants. 
1:46 1:46 FEMALE: Yeah.  
1:47 1:47 MALE: Okay.
1:47 1:53 FEMALE: So, I actually was reading a paper the other day where um, people used MRI on plants.
1:55 1:55 MALE: Uh-huh.
1:54 2:02 FEMALE: Um, because you can um, so plants move water through their tissues, right?  
2:03 2:03 MALE: Right.
2:02 2:07 FEMALE: Um, and occasionally that- that water system breaks.
2:08 2:08 MALE: Uh-huh.
2:08 2:12 FEMALE: And so you get, you get bubbles inside the plant.  And you can use MRI to see those bubbles.
2:13 2:13 MALE: Right.
2:12 2:15 FEMALE: And see them getting refilled by the plant.  Um.
2:16 2:22 MALE: Right, 'cause I guess, um, if there's a bubble in there, then there is no signal from the bubble, then it's dark in the MRI unit.
2:22 2:24 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  So.
2:26 2:27 MALE: So I can use that.  
2:26 2:32 FEMALE: You know, it's not saving lives, but it's a- it's a cool application of MRI to me.
2:33 2:36 MALE: Right.  So what do you do on your spare time?
2:36 2:39 FEMALE: Uh, I like to hike.  Um, and bike, get outside.  
2:41 2:43 MALE: So you're, are you a serious biker, like spandex [unintelligible]
2:43 2:48 FEMALE: No. [laughter]  No, not at all.  Um, but I enjoy it.  
2:49 2:49 MALE: Okay.
2:49 2:55 FEMALE: But yeah, I don't do the like serious, you know, bike to the ocean and back, stuff.  What about you?  Do you -- ?
2:57 3:00 MALE: I only bike from Muni to bus campus.
3:00 3:00 FEMALE: Okay.
3:02 3:05 MALE: So it's like uh, 1.5 miles one way.
3:04 3:05 FEMALE: Right.  Yeah.
3:07 3:10 MALE: It'd be like 15 minutes.  Or so.
3:11 3:12 FEMALE: Gotcha.  Where are you from?
3:13 3:14 MALE: Uh, China.
3:15 3:16 FEMALE: How long have you been here?
3:17 3:18 MALE: About five years.
3:21 3:21 FEMALE: How do you like it?
3:23 3:23 MALE: I enjoy it.  
3:24 3:26 FEMALE: Have you- have you lived anywhere else in the U.S., or-- ?
3:27 3:31 MALE: Uh, I only shortly visited uh, New York, New York City.
3:30 3:30 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  
3:32 3:36 MALE: And I like, I like New York City.  'Cause it's a very similar to a big city in China.
3:35 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:38 3:39 MALE: Where are you- where are you originally from?
3:39 3:40 FEMALE: I grew up in Oregon.  So--
3:42 3:43 MALE: Okay.  It's south, north then.
3:40 3:42 FEMALE: So, it's north of here.  Yeah.
3:44 3:44 MALE: Portland?
3:43 3:50 FEMALE: Uh, no, I grew up south of Portland, in Corvalis.  Yeah.
3:52 3:54 MALE: Okay.  So, are you in the Ph.D. program?
3:54 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
3:58 4:02 MALE: So, how long- how long does it take to get a Ph- Ph.D. in biology?
4:01 4:03 FEMALE: About five years.  Five or six.  [horn]
4:06 4:07 MALE: Depends on how fast the plants grow.
4:06 4:08 FEMALE: Yeah, it depends on a lot.  [laughter]
4:09 4:10 MALE: Nice to meet you.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE: Good to meet you.
