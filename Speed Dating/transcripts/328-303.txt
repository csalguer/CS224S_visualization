0:03 0:03 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  It's nice to meet you, male303.
0:05 0:06 MALE:  [unintelligible] the school year?
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Uh PTSB [phonetic]?
0:07 0:08 MALE:  Yeah, thought so.
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  Why?

0:09 0:10 FEMALE:  Oh, are you first year?
0:10 0:11 MALE:  I am a first year.
0:11 0:13 FEMALE:  Oh, I feel badly I don't know you.
0:13 0:13 MALE:  No, it's all right.
0:15 0:17 FEMALE:  Uh, so how are you liking it so far?
0:17 0:25 MALE:  It's good.  It's good.  This quarter, things were kind of awful, you know.  It's just like class seemed a lot easier.  I got a lot more free time.
0:25 0:27 FEMALE:  Free time.  That's bad?
0:28 0:30 MALE:  Yeah.  Do you have any free time right now?
0:31 0:58 FEMALE:  I have--I'm doing a 356, so like, you know.  I--I just spent the last two days in Boston at a conference.  Um--this--the 356 is on robotics, and we're going to start the company--or we are starting the company.  Um so I was out there to assess out the competition.  And so now I'm back and I'm like well, I have a lot of work to get done.  [laughter] So I need to prevent my--it's not that I'm worried about my grades, but I need to prevent my teams from killing me--
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Yeah.
0:58 1:00 FEMALE:  --or having justification to kill me.
1:00 1:03 MALE:  Yeah.  All right.  Outside of--outside of school, what do you do?
1:04 1:17 FEMALE:  Uh outside of school, outside of company, those--those like four hours, I like to go into the city.  I've got family in the city and a couple friends from college um--
1:17 1:18 MALE:  Do you get to go to school?
1:19 1:24 FEMALE:  Uh no.  I was at Harvard for undergrad.  There was a fair number of us out here.
1:24 1:24 MALE:  That's good.
1:24 1:32 FEMALE:  And so I came with a reasonable number of the JSB [phonetic] parties, I guess.  Okay.  I've gotten much better about that.
1:32 1:33 MALE:  You didn't used to go?
1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  Oh, I was--
1:34 1:34 MALE:  Or you used to go like--
1:35 1:36 FEMALE:  Oh, I used to like hardly go.
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Okay.
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  I was so bad.
1:37 1:37 MALE:  Why?
1:38 1:43 FEMALE:  'Cause last year I was dating someone off campus and, you know, it takes up time.
1:44 1:44 MALE:  Yup.
1:44 1:50 FEMALE:  So [unintelligible], so tell me about this copious free time you've got and what--
1:50 1:50 MALE:  Yeah, this--
1:50 1:51 FEMALE:  --do you do with it?
1:51 1:54 MALE:  This quarter is great.  [laughter].
1:54 1:54 FEMALE:  How so?
1:55 1:56 MALE:  'Cause my--like my elective [unintelligible].
1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh.
1:57 2:01 MALE:  So it's just like that's it, you know.  Like we're um actually playing like a lot of golf.
2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:01 2:02 MALE:  I'm trying to get better.
2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:03 2:10 MALE:  When I first [unintelligible], I think it's less about the game for me.  It's more about I'm outside for like five hours in the summer.
2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:11 2:15 MALE:  It's just like nothing left, you know.  And I mean, I'm also trying to like work out a lot more--
2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:15 2:15 MALE:  --so either running--
2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:17 2:21 MALE:  --um or like lifting, and it's just--when you work out, for me--
2:21 2:22 FEMALE:  Nice, nice.
2:23 2:26 MALE:  When you--when you work out, like you just feel better.
2:26 2:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, I hear you.
2:27 2:29 MALE:  You know?  But it's the kind of thing where you know you're going to feel better--
2:29 2:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:30 2:33 MALE:  --and you like--you just feel more alive in general--
2:33 2:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:33 2:44 MALE:  --but yet it's so easy to be like oh, I have--I have my 206 projects, so I have to go to Boston, like I'm not going to ride, you know.  And all of a sudden, it's like a week.  So I mean, I really find it hard to kind of stay with that sport.
2:44 2:47 FEMALE:  Oh, good.  Are you--you're living in [unintelligible]?
2:47 2:47 MALE:  No.
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Oh.
2:48 2:49 MALE:  I live in [unintelligible].
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:50 2:51 MALE:  I have a studio [unintelligible].
2:51 2:51 FEMALE:  Nice.  So--
2:52 2:53 MALE:  It's a little different experience.
2:54 3:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, not that--good for you for like making that extra effort, 'cause I was going to say, if you're--you're in [unintelligible], you've got the gym like right there so it's a little easier.
3:01 3:01 MALE:  Yeah.
3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  That's awesome.
3:02 3:04 MALE:  What are you--what are you--I mean, you're starting the company--
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:05 3:09 MALE:  --here in like around here or in Boston in the city?
3:08 3:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No, um here and I'm probably only going to stay with it through the summer 'cause I've got--I mean--'cause--'cause I have somebody putting me through school, so I could either write them the $90,000 bite-me check or I can go back for like maybe six months or whatever and then be in a better position to write them the slightly reduced bite-me check.
3:31 3:35 MALE:  Yes.  Did you say you grew up in this--in the city or you just have family that's in the city?
3:36 3:40 FEMALE:  I just have family that's wound up here.  Um I grew up on--in New York or on Long Island.
3:40 3:42 MALE:  Okay.  I lived in New York the last four years--
3:42 3:42 FEMALE:  Oh really.
