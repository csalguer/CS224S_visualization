0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hi. 

0:01 0:01 MALE:  I'm male212. 

0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  Hi male212 I'm female233. 

0:03 0:03 MALE:  Nice to meet you female233. 

0:04 0:06 FEMALE:  We have already started? 

0:07 0:08 MALE:  I guess we are.  So tell me about yourself.  What department are you in? 

0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school. 

0:14 0:14 MALE:  Okay cool. 

0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  I'm doing a PhD. 

0:17 0:19 MALE:  So do you like get your GAD first or is it like -- 

0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Yes, I had GAD first in Mexico, I'm from Mexico and then I came here for a PhD. 

0:28 0:28 MALE:  Okay cool.  Nice. 

0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  But [unintelligible] the same.  Your department? 

0:32 0:32 MALE:  I'm actually management science and engineering, so I'm taking a law course actually.  It's a survey of law where we're teaching the whole three years of law curriculum in just one quarter, so we like covered torts on Monday and you know all one days worth. 

0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  [laughter] I don't even know everything about torts it took me awhile. 

0:51 0:52 MALE:  Well it was in the business school, so you know like we only needed [unintelligible] knowledge, but yeah so I mean I do MSNE and it's my first year here. 

0:58 1:00 FEMALE:  That went fast.  Was it? 

1:03 1:04 MALE:  What's that I don't know. 

1:04 1:07 FEMALE:  Oh we are starting now. 

1:08 1:08 MALE:  We're starting now.  Oh so we got an extra few minutes. 

1:11 1:12 FEMALE:  Yeah we sure did, do we?  Okay well anyway. 

1:15 1:15 MALE:  We'll keep going. 

1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  Okay. 

1:17 1:17 MALE:  So what sort of stuff do you enjoy doing in your non-PhD law school time? 

1:22 1:24 FEMALE:  Okay.  Why don't I -- well there is not much left of that space, but I guess you know, probably I will go to San Francisco and I like very much classical music. 

1:41 1:41 MALE:  Oh really? 

1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  The symphony.  Last year I went to a lot of [unintelligible], this year I haven't had the chance.  I don't know, I like music and concerts. 

1:50 1:51 MALE:  Yeah. 

1:52 2:02 FEMALE:  But that's it.  I mean and the movies of course is like the mandatory thing to do at least once a week, probably Thursday. 

1:58 2:00 MALE:  Yeah and I actually kind of classical music myself.  I saw the Flying Dutchman this year at the opera, but I haven't yet been to Davy Symphony Hall. 

2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  No?  You have to go. 

2:08 2:08 MALE:  I know and I'm like running out of time since I graduate in June, but -- 

2:11 2:12 FEMALE:  Yes and they have very cheap tickets for students.  

2:14 2:15 MALE:  But it was pretty cool, I mean I got to see Yo-Yo Ma and [unintelligible] this year and I always wanted to see Yo-Yo Ma like all throughout my life. 

2:24 2:25  FEMALE:  [laughter] okay. 

2:25 2:26 MALE:  I like brought all my CDs in my little bag.  I was like waiting for the autograph, but he couldn't see the autographs, he sort of went off, but -- 

2:33 2:34 FEMALE:  Oh. 

2:34 2:35 MALE:  It's pretty cool. 

2:35 2:37 FEMALE:  But you're graduating and from here where are you going to? 

2:40 2:40 MALE:  Actually I'm not sure yet.  I just found out today that I'm officially graduating this spring instead of moving on towards like having to do the fall quarter, so I don't know.  I just came from a job interview right now, we'll see what happens. 

2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah well that -- 

2:53 2:53 MALE:  Something consulting, I don't know. 

2:54 2:56 FEMALE:  You're from California? 

2:57 2:58 MALE:  No actually I'm from Illinois, so I had to make the transition over here.  You know the weather it's nice, but you know at nighttime it gets as cold as it is in Illinois and I'm like, I thought I left for California. 

3:09 3:10 FEMALE:  The sunny California.  Yeah when I was here it was freezing. 

3:12 3:13 MALE:  Yeah. 

3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  Totally freezing and I said this is not part of California, it can't be that way. 

3:18 3:19 MALE:  It's crazy, but so what do you plan to do then like teach at law school or teach law at a school then or just --

3:24 3:25 FEMALE:  I guess.  I'm going to take the bar probably this year in New York and I think I'll go one year to work over there. 

3:31 3:32 MALE:  Okay cool. 

3:32 3:33 FEMALE:  And then what I want to do is go to New York and work there, not forever because I know my family and my heart is in Mexico, so I will eventually go back, but I want to go to Europe. 

3:45 3:46 MALE:  Well you know with all the EU and the court justice and all that stuff it's pretty large. 

3:51 3:51 FEMALE:  So you have to learn law and then [unintelligible] I probably will be sick of going into so many law schools and that's it. 

3:57 4:00 MALE:  So you can like take the bar in like different states even though you're from California?  

4:04 4:05 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  California is supposed to be very difficult because [unintelligible] lawyers, like they have very few spaces, whatever I don't know.  The ratio of passing is paper thin I guess.  In New York it's 80%. 

4:19 4:20 MALE:  Right. 

4:20 4:22 FEMALE:  So -- 

4:22 4:37 MALE:  Yeah I guess it's just the reciprocal bar agreements that are different.  So -- yeah a friend of mine was applying to law school and she's like "I don't want to apply to Stanford because they don't have a reciprocal agreement with anyone."  And I'm like "I didn't know that was a factor to consider when going to law school." 

4:37 4:38 FEMALE:  Everybody who is here loves law school, I don't know.  I love my classes because I have you know this professor who might be a physician with a PhD in economics and eventually became a lawyer.  He will be you know, he knows about base theory and how would that apply into ruling a sentence you know? 

4:58 5:02 MALE:  Were you at the nameX Jennings thing with the law school?  This like the guy on Jeopardy? 

5:06 5:09 FEMALE:  Yes [unintelligible]. 

5:10 5:11 MALE:  Well I guess that brings our thing to a [unintelligible].  It was a pleasure meeting you, good luck with everything. 

5:16 5:17 FEMALE:  And good luck with your interviews. 

5:18 5:18 MALE:  Thanks.
