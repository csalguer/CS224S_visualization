0:02 0:05 FEMALE: Hi.  Station A.  [laughter]   I'm female121.

0:05 0:05 MALE: Hi, male108 [phonetic].

0:07 0:08 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

0:06 0:09 MALE: We have met before, uh, like nameX was there right?

0:11 0:13 FEMALE: You were just there for a minute but you didn't come to the movie.

0:12 0:14 MALE: Yeah, okay.  So did you enjoy the movie?

0:16 0:16 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:15 0:15 MALE: Okay.

0:17 0:24 FEMALE: I think tonight was a Thursday, it was the last night.  So you missed it but it's really--if it comes out on DVD you should get it.

0:23 0:23 MALE: Okay.

0:25 0:26 FEMALE: It's really, really good.

0:25 0:25 MALE: Okay.

0:26 0:27 FEMALE: It's kind of quirky.

0:27 0:28 MALE: Okay, um--

0:29 0:34 FEMALE: It's just about a guy that lives in San Francisco, and there's a big flock of wild parrots.

0:33 0:36 MALE: Is it too emotional or something like that and you had to--

0:37 0:39 FEMALE: No, no.  No, you laugh a lot.

0:39 0:40 MALE: Oh, oh that's encouraging.

0:41 0:50 FEMALE: He's very entertaining.  He's very entertaining, and he really loves all these birds, and he has names for them, and makes up stories about them, and so it's really--it's fun.  It's a fun movie.

0:49 0:49 MALE: Uh huh.

0:51 0:52 FEMALE: Yeah.  You should have come.

0:52 0:52 MALE: Ugh.

0:53 0:54 FEMALE: You had too much work?

0:53 0:54 MALE: Yeah, actually.

0:55 0:57 FEMALE: I did too but I still went.

0:57 1:03 MALE: Yeah, I had to finish my work by today to get to this even maybe.  Although it's not that busy for me this week.

1:04 1:05 FEMALE: Did you finish?

1:04 1:04 MALE: Yeah I did.

1:06 1:07 FEMALE: Good.  Congratulations.

1:06 1:11 MALE: Yeah, I don't [unintelligible] due today so I did this and this.  Which school, like which department are you from?

1:12 1:13 FEMALE: I'm in the ed school right here.

1:12 1:14 MALE: Oh, you're in the ed school.  Okay.

1:14 1:15 FEMALE: Mm hmm, yeah.

1:14 1:16 MALE: So you are participating just to be--

1:18 1:18 FEMALE: Helpful.

1:18 1:19 MALE: Helpful and--

1:20 1:31 FEMALE: And I was interested to see what would happen.  I've never done something like this before, but Professor nameX, who's running this thing is one of my professors this quarter, so he handed out the form in class.

1:31 1:32 MALE: And what does that mean this quarter?

1:34 1:37 FEMALE: Um, we're on the quarter system, you know, so I take--

1:36 1:37 MALE: Oh, you are taking the class from Professor--

1:38 1:40 FEMALE: From him, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:38 1:39 MALE: Okay, okay.

1:41 1:45 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, and so he handed out the forms in our class so I learned about it that way.

1:44 1:45 MALE: Okay, okay.

1:46 1:48 FEMALE: Yeah.  [laughter] 

1:47 1:47 MALE: So what--?

1:49 1:50 FEMALE: And you got the email?

1:49 1:50 MALE: Yeah, electrical engineers--

1:52 1:53 FEMALE: They were sending it out to everybody.

1:52 1:53 MALE: Yeah well [laughter] 

1:55 1:56 FEMALE: Great.  That's good.

1:55 2:03 MALE: If it's sent--if it's sent to electrical engineering, all the engineering people like nameX was saying that they're like, well you won't need anything more than that.

2:04 2:19 FEMALE: [laughter] Well it's funny because someone I was talking to before, I don't think people on this side of campus get over-I think there is a big separation between engineers and as far as physics and sciences over there, and then the humanities and the social sciences.

2:17 2:18 MALE: Right, right.

2:19 2:25 FEMALE: And it's kind of silly because, I mean, everyone's busy so it would be hard to find time but--

2:23 2:26 MALE: Yeah, the graduates especially don't make--

2:27 2:28 FEMALE: You don't hang out.

2:28 2:36 MALE: Well, it's because like the usual population itself is so big, of the school, that who will organize the event on such a large scale?

2:38 2:43 FEMALE: Right, right, and get--and also I think people generally hang out with the people in their program so--

2:41 2:52 MALE: Because they have the same--have the same classes or like--  It's usually like, I had a friend who was like in my second year, I had common classes, we would--but I have not seen him for quite a long time now.

2:54 2:54 FEMALE: It's a bummer.

2:54 2:54 MALE: Yeah.

2:55 2:55 FEMALE: It's a bummer.

2:55 2:59 MALE: And suddenly I find that he's taken a job or something and then I call him and then--

3:01 3:10 FEMALE: I know.  I know and that's why I'm--  It was fun going to the movies with those guys but I should have been doing more stuff in the Blackwelder--

3:10 3:11 MALE: So how do you know nameX or like--

3:13 3:17 FEMALE: Just because of the--just because I responded to the email.  I didn't-I don't know nameX at all.

3:16 3:17 MALE: Oh, okay.

3:18 3:22 FEMALE: No, I just met him right before I saw you so yeah.  [laughter] 

3:20 3:22 MALE: Oh okay. [laughter] 

3:24 3:34 FEMALE: He um--no, because I got the email about the movies and I've always thought oh I want to go do that, and then Sunday night comes and I have a lot of work for Monday and I usually think I can't go.

3:32 3:35 MALE: Yeah, that's a bad time for flicks, right?  Like Sunday nights.

3:37 3:42 FEMALE: Sunday nights is really hard.  So this was actually a much easier time.  I still had a lot of work but--

3:42 3:42 MALE: Okay.

3:43 3:45 FEMALE: I know.  [laughter]  Nice seeing you.

3:44 3:44 MALE: Yeah.

3:52 3:53 FEMALE: [laughter]  So come to the next movie. 

3:54 3:54 MALE: Okay.

3:55 3:55 FEMALE: You should go.
