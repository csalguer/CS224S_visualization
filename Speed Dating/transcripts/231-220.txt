0:25 0:26 FEMALE: But sort of fun.

0:22 0:23 MALE: It's been like about half an hour now or something.

0:28 0:29 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:24 0:25 MALE: It seems like it's been--

0:29 0:30 FEMALE: It's moving along okay.

0:25 0:26 MALE: Right. 

0:31 0:33 FEMALE: So, right.

0:27 0:28 MALE: What department are you in?

0:33 0:34 FEMALE: I'm in communication.

0:29 0:30 MALE: Oh okay.

0:34 0:35 FEMALE: You?

0:30 0:31 MALE: I'm in electrical engineering.

0:36 0:38 FEMALE: Okay.  Cool, how long have you been here?

0:33 0:34 MALE: Uh five and a half years.

0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Okay.  

0:35 0:36 MALE: Yeah.  Should have that ready [unintelligible].

0:41 0:42 FEMALE: So you're getting ready to be done or--?

0:37 0:41 MALE: Uh yeah I'm almost--I'm almost done.  I think I'll be done in December or maybe, maybe next winter.

0:47 0:48 FEMALE: Are you excited about it?

0:43 0:56 MALE: Uh yeah, I mean I'm, yeah, definitely.  It'll be, it'll be good to move on and uh, I don't have, like, a specific plan.  I mean I don't have, like, a job lined up or anything, but I'll probably get a--I work, I work, like, in ultrasound imaging, so.

1:01 1:02 FEMALE: Okay.  

0:57 1:04 MALE: Right now I'm kind of on the engineering end of things, so I'd kind of like to learn some more about um, more about the medical aspect of it.

1:09 1:10 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:04 1:08 MALE: I think that's one of the things to maybe do a post-doc or find, like, a small company.
 
1:14 1:16 FEMALE: So what's your favorite thing about Palo Alto?  You've been here for five years.

1:11 1:13 MALE: Palo Alto?  Um, hmm.

1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Or about the Greater Bay Area.

1:15 1:18 MALE: The Greater Bay Area.  I, I just like that there's a lot of stuff to do here, I mean--

1:23 1:24 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:18 1:25 MALE: I mean just the variety.  I like the weather, um.  Yeah.  I like being able to do stuff all year round.

1:30 1:31 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:26 1:28 MALE: And I mean there's so much, like, I'm from Wyoming originally, so--

1:33 1:34 FEMALE: Oh from Wyoming?

1:29 1:30 MALE: Yeah.  

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Oh okay.

1:30 1:31 MALE: So I mean--

1:35 1:38 FEMALE: They're the first state to give the women the right to vote.

1:33 1:43 MALE: We're the equality state, that's right, it's because we couldn't get--well, maybe, I'm not sure, it may--part of the reason is 'cause there wasn't enough people.  Like they, they need so many people to uh, like to become a state.

1:48 1:49 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  

1:43 1:44 MALE: So then--

1:49 1:50 FEMALE: So they counted the women.

1:45 1:47 MALE: So [unintelligible] so it's not quite as--

1:52 1:53 FEMALE: I've actually never heard that story.

1:47 1:51 MALE: --noble, maybe it's not as noble, maybe it's not as noble.

1:56 1:57 FEMALE: It's okay.

1:52 1:53 MALE: But it's on our license plates.

1:57 1:59 FEMALE: It's nice to hear the real story.  

1:54 1:56 MALE: The real story.

2:00 2:01 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:56 1:59 MALE: How about you?  What are you into or what do you like about this area?

2:05 2:14 FEMALE: What do I like about the area?  Um I like the weather.  Like the weather a great deal.  Um I like that there is, I mean, kind of have to repeat what you said.  I like that there's a lot to do.  I like San Francisco a lot.

2:09 2:10 MALE: Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it's definitely very cool.

2:14 2:27 FEMALE: I have some friends from undergrad who live up there, and so I'm starting to actually get to know the city a little bit.  Um, I have some friends who actually have in their apartment like a guest bedroom, so I can go up for the weekend and, like, you know, settle in and wander their neighborhood, and you know, meet people.

2:21 2:22 MALE: Oh that's pretty good.

2:28 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah.  So it's fun to be near a city that is that interesting.

2:27 2:29 MALE: Mm-hmm.  Yeah San Francisco is--

2:34 2:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:30 2:34 MALE: It's awesome.  I mean it's definitely one of the most interesting cities I think [unintelligible] so.

2:38 2:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  Do you live on campus or--?

2:36 2:38 MALE: I live--I live at Oak Creek Apartments, you know, on Sand Hill.

2:43 2:44 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:39 2:40 MALE: So pretty, pretty close.

2:45 2:46 FEMALE: Pretty close?

2:41 2:45 MALE: Yeah.  I live--I lived on campus--I'm in my sixth year, so I, I lived on campus for two years.

2:51 2:52 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:47 2:48 MALE: And then [unintelligible].

2:53 2:54 FEMALE: Decided to move out, buy your own furniture.

2:49 2:52 MALE: Yeah.  I have my own furniture.  It's pretty, it's pretty awesome.

2:57 2:58 FEMALE: It's great.  It's great.

2:54 2:55 MALE: Right.  How about you, what, what year are you in?

3:01 3:02 FEMALE: I'm first year.

2:56 2:57 MALE: Oh okay.

3:02 3:04 FEMALE: So I've only been here for about, like, six or seven months now, something like that.

2:59 3:00 MALE: Uh-huh.  

3:05 3:06 FEMALE: I should know that too, uh--

3:01 3:05 MALE: But, okay, you say you know some people from undergrad, did you go [unintelligible]?

3:10 3:11 FEMALE: I know, I know some people from undergrad in Texas who--

3:06 3:07 MALE: Oh okay.

3:12 3:20 FEMALE: --moved out to San Francisco, who just happen to be there.  So, which is nice to have some people sort of, you know, like other friends who are here as well.

3:15 3:17 MALE: Mm-hmm.  Yeah definitely.

3:21 3:24 FEMALE: So it's nice to have some people to kind of rely on when I first got up here.

3:19 3:20 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  It's good.

3:25 3:26 FEMALE: So.

3:20 3:23 MALE: Yeah but Stanford's a good place to meet other people [unintelligible].

3:28 3:31 FEMALE: Yeah.  People are very friendly.  I moved from DC here.

3:26 3:27 MALE: Uh-huh.  

3:31 3:35 FEMALE: Um and I think people are much friendlier on the West Coast than they are on the East Coast.  That's been my--

3:30 3:32 MALE: I--that's definitely the stereotype, right?

3:36 3:37 FEMALE: Yeah.  Well, I mean--

3:33 3:34 MALE: That's--

3:37 3:40 FEMALE: --my experience has actually held that that's true as well, so.

3:36 3:39 MALE: But your--East Coasters are more sophisticated and uh--

3:43 3:44 FEMALE: I don't know that that's always true.

3:40 3:41 MALE: Really, no?  You don't think so?

3:47 3:52 FEMALE: I don't know.  Maybe it's just the people at Stanford are particularly, like, you know, smart and interesting anyway, so--

3:47 3:52 MALE: That's, that's another thing that's good about, like, people here are really smart and have really interesting, interesting things that they're into.

3:57 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:53 3:54 MALE: Yeah.  

3:59 4:04 FEMALE: Yeah.  Um do--so you don't necessarily want to go on to be a professor, or is that--?

3:59 4:02 MALE: No, I'm not going to be--no, I don't think so.  I mean it's just--

4:06 4:07 FEMALE: So why the PhD then?

4:02 4:11 MALE: Uh I mean it's really good--I mean it's, it's a--it's um--if you really want to know like a technical area or, or do, like, sort of research stuff, you need, you need to be a PhD.

4:16 4:17 FEMALE: Okay.  

4:12 4:18 MALE: Um, you don't, you don't have to, but it's definitely [horn] it's definitely better.  Is that the--?

4:23 4:25 FEMALE: Can't tell whether that was the horn or--?  Did you go to undergrad here or--?

4:21 4:22 MALE: No, I went to Wyoming.

4:27 4:28 FEMALE: Oh okay.  [horn]  There it is.

4:24 4:25 MALE: Anyways, well, it was nice to meet you.

4:30 4:31 FEMALE: It was nice meeting you too.

4:26 4:27 MALE: Yeah.  Have fun.
  
4:33 4:34 FEMALE: Enjoy the rest of your evening.

4:29 4:30 MALE: Yeah.  Thanks.
