00:01 00:01  FEMALE:  Hi.
00:04 00:04  MALE:  Hi, I'm male307.
00:03 00:04  FEMALE:  Nice to meet you, male307.  I'm female321.
00:06 00:08  MALE:  Nice to meet you.  How's it going. 
00:07 00:07  FEMALE:  That's interesting [laughter].
00:09 00:10  MALE:  Good answer. 
00:09 00:10  FEMALE:  I've never done this before [laughter].
00:12 00:18  MALE:  Yeah, it's definately [unintelligible] process going around and having like four minute conversations.
00:16 00:17  FEMALE:  Yeah.
00:19 00:21  MALE:  It's cool you get to learn [unintelligible] about other people. 
00:20 00:24  FEMALE:  Yeah, and yourself.  Like what things you want to highlight about yourself or whatever. 
00:26 00:31  MALE:  Have your conversations been very consistent or have you varied it up? 
00:29 00:44  FEMALE:  Consistent.  But honestly--and this is, this is the heart, this is the heart of your study [unintelligible] right here.  I am getting sick of saying what I, you know, just the general stuff that people are asking.  And I'd love people to know more about me other than what school I went to--
00:45 00:46  MALE:  [interposing] like what?
00:46 01:03  FEMALE: and what my specialization interest is.  That I'm a very artsy, fun-loving, passionate person--which I said to two people [laughter].  I'm very, I'm very sensitive and I'm very caring.  I like to make art all the time, poetry, painting, dance, songs--
01:05 01:05  MALE:  [interposing] Wow
01:03 01:07  FEMALE:  --write sci-fi novels.  I'm crazy.
01:09 01:09  MALE:  Really.
01:07 01:17  FEMALE:  Not that I've finished doing it.  I just began it.  I'm kind of board--I mean board, yeah, I'm kind of board too--I'm board with like all the work I have to do and kind of exhuasted [laughter].
01:19 01:22  MALE:  So are you going to pursue this artistic--
01:20 01:21  FEMALE:  [interposing] Yes, I need to--
01:23 01:23  MALE:  --part of yourself?
01:21 01:24  FEMALE:  It's absolutely essential.
01:26 01:27  MALE:  And how are you going to do that?
01:26 01:36  FEMALE:  Um, well after this program, this masters, education, education/social science program, I'm going to get a job.  And as I'm paying back loans I want to be a comedian on the side.
01:38 01:38  MALE:  Really.
01:37 01:38  FEMALE:  Yes. 
01:40 01:40  MALE:  That's pretty cool. 
01:39 01:41  FEMALE:  I need to let things out.  Some people can--
01:43 01:45  MALE:  [interposing] improv or like you're going to make up an act?
01:44 01:45  FEMALE:  I think improv.
01:46 01:54  MALE:  I'm taking the improv class right now in the drama school.
01:47 01:48  FEMALE:  Oh, cool.
01:50 01:55  MALE:  It's really cool.  Have you taken it?  I highly recommend it.  It's a lot of fun.
01:53 01:54  FEMALE:  That's cool.
01:55 01:56  MALE:  If you have the time in your schedule.
01:55 01:58  FEMALE:  Were people uptight and stuff?  Because I am so down-to-earth and loose.
02:00 02:00  MALE:  In the improv class?
01:59 02:05  FEMALE:  Well I mean in, in the school, in this school.  Have you felt that way?
02:07 02:13  MALE:  Oh, in general that I think people are uptight.  Spectrum.  We certainly have some uptight people and some--
02:12 02:12  FEMALE:  [interposing] yeah.
02:10 02:14  MALE:  --and some relaxed people.
02:12 02:15  FEMALE:  There are some really amazing people and there are some uptight people.
02:16 02:31  MALE:  I think it's all relative so.  I went to school on the east coast and they were much more uptight um, where I went to school.  So I think I, I give people a lot of slack here because of my experience there.  You went to school on the east coast as well?
02:29 02:30  FEMALE:  Wesleyan.
02:31 02:32  MALE:  Mmm.
02:32 02:37  FEMALE:  And it was like a like, it was like a little laid back little dot in Conneticut, but... 
02:40 02:40  MALE:  How long have you been out here?
02:38 02:43  FEMALE:  Um, well I grew up here and I--it's weird to go to school--
02:43 02:44  MALE:  [interposing] here in Palleto?
02:43 02:44  FEMALE:  Ah, Redwood City. 
02:46 02:47  MALE:  Yeah.  Pretty cool. 
02:45 02:49  FEMALE:  But I went to high school in Palo though, all girls school across the street from Stanford. 
02:50 02:51  MALE:  Gotcha. 
02:49 02:51  FEMALE:  So it's interesting that--
02:52 02:52  MALE:  [interposing] this is home. 
02:51 03:05  FEMALE:  Yes.  But I'm learning that I want to branch out.  I want to explore other places.  My best friend's in Boston.  I want to try to get a job in student affairs there.  Um, I'm excited about life. 
03:07 03:08  MALE:  Student affairs in a college there? 
03:07 03:07  FEMALE:  Yes.
03:09 03:09  MALE:  Cool
03:08 03:10  FEMALE:  I mean like I just feel this desire and--
03:12 03:14  MALE:  [interposing] why aren't you pursuing arts as your main profession?
03:13 03:22  FEMALE:  Because I've been pressured and I'm allowed to pressure my parents to control my--um, I really didn't know what to do with my life.
03:24 03:24  MALE:  Okay.
03:23 04:01  FEMALE:  And then also I've just been trained in my preppy, you know, family to like pursue something that can pay the bills.  And that's not why I'm doing what I'm doing.  But I'm, I feel like I'm pretty good at it--research, but um, or maybe becoming a teacher, but, a professor maybe.  But um, honestly I think--actually I feel more safe doing that now because if I do what I love and that gets all messed up I wouldn't--that's my base, that's where I'm centered and everything.  So I want to protect that by being my little gig that I like--
04:02 04:03  MALE:  [interposing] interesting. 
04:01 04:03  FEMALE:  --do on the side or something.
04:04 04:09  MALE:  That's interesting.  I haven't thought of it that way.  Hmm.  Cool.
04:08 04:08  FEMALE:  Cool.
