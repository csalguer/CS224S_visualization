0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hi. 
0:01 0:03 MALE:  How do you do?  Oh, sorry.  I was looking for water. 
0:03 0:05 FEMALE:  Oh, no.  Don't worry about it. 
0:06 0:06 MALE:  [unintelligible]. 
0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  I'm female335. 
0:07 0:08 MALE:  female335? 
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:08 0:09 MALE:  How are you?
0:09 0:09 FEMALE:  Good. 
0:10 0:12 MALE:  Uh, where, where are you from, or--
0:12 0:21 FEMALE:  I don't think they started--oh, maybe they have.  Okay.  I'm from here.  I'm from Sacramento, so it's just Northern California.  And I actually went here for college, so I'm really from here. 
0:21 0:22 MALE: Okay.  And you went--you went here?
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Yes.  Yeah. 
0:23 0:25 MALE:  And are you a graduate student?
0:25 0:30 FEMALE:  I am.  I'm a PhD candidate, and, uh, I went straight through from college, so.
0:30 0:33 MALE:  Okay.  What, what department are you in?
0:33 0:42 FEMALE:  Um, now I'm in Biology.  I was an applied math major in college.  Um, and now I study mathematical biology.  Uh, using math to make biological predictions. 
0:43 0:46 MALE:  That's cool.  Um, I'm doing optimization for electrical engineering. 
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  Okay. 
0:47 0:48 MALE:  I just--I just started. 
0:50 0:52 FEMALE:  Are you planning to stay for a PhD. 
0:51 0:54 MALE:  I don't know.  We'll see how it goes. 
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  So how do you like the area so far?
0:56 0:57 MALE:  It's awesome. 
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  That's great. 
0:58 1:02 MALE: I love it.  Um, I went to--I went to go to Cal Tech.  I came here.  
1:01 1:01 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:02 1:06 MALE:  Uh, then I worked for a couple years in Boston out here.  I love it here. 
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  That's good. 
1:07 1:08 MALE:  I think it's, like, the best of all the places [unintelligible]--
1:08 1:10 FEMALE:  Better than Southern California.  That's what I think. [laughter]
1:10 1:11 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely. 
1:11 1:12 FEMALE:  I'm a Northern California girl. [laughter]
1:13 1:14 MALE:  So you say you're from Sacramento?
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Um hm.  That's where I grew up.
1:16 1:18 MALE:  Okay.  How, how do you like it here, compared to Sacramento?
1:18 1:24 FEMALE:  I like it a lot.  I mean, Sacramento, it's nice because it's a capital.  Like, I think it's a nice--it was a nice place to grow up as a kid. 
1:24 1:25 MALE:  It's nice because it's the capital? [laughter]
1:25 1:56 FEMALE:  Well, I mean, there's stuff going on there as a result.  It's kind of--despite being suburban, it's very metropolitan as--because it's the capital.  You know, basketball team and the governor lives there and stuff.  Um, but I like the bay area more.  Uh, it's less warm and Sacramento's closer to Tahoe, which is nice, but I think I enjoy the nature out here a little bit better.  Um, and I like the university, like, the fact that Berkley and UCS [unintelligible] Stanford are also close by.  So my--
1:56 1:57 MALE:  [unintelligible] close to here?
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's in Sacrem--it's in San Francisco. 
2:00 2:01 MALE:  Oh, right, right, right.  Okay. 
2:01 2:03 FEMALE:  Yeah. But I don't--
2:03 2:04 MALE:  Do you like [unintelligible]--
2:04 2:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I don't enjoy the LA area very much.  I go there for work a lot, but I can't stand it for more than five days that easily. 
2:11 2:12 MALE:  When you have to go there for work?
2:12 2:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, I collaborate with the post-doc out there at USC, so, yeah. 
2:18 2:20 MALE:  So, um, what do you like to do?
2:21 2:47 FEMALE:  Outside of work?  [laughter] Well, right now, I'm working a lot just on my dissertation, but, um, I just really like to relax with friends.  I watch a lot of movies.  That's something I enjoy quite a bit.  Um, I like listening to music, and I like hiking, do a lot of out--like outdoor things.  But nothing really out of the ordinary.  This is a really nice area to just get to drive around and, you know, spend time in Napa or in the city or in Santa Cruise.  I like to do that. 
2:47 2:51 MALE:  Yeah, I'm just--I'm just beginning to find all the stuff around here.  I love it. 
2:51 3:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, I mean now this is my seventh year here, and there's still more stuff, so there's a lot to do.  But I particularly enjoy, nowadays, going to Santa Cruise.  Um, UC Santa Cruise is really beautiful, and it has--it's like a forest, basically, a red wood forest, and the, the plants there are really neat.  It's a fun place to go. 
3:10 3:14 MALE:  I think I went there with some--some club.  Some electric [unintelligible] club. 
3:14 3:15 FEMALE:  Um hm. 
3:15 3:22 MALE:  [unintelligible] is that--you have to drive through a mountain to get there?  Like, you have to drive up, like, through--down, down through a mountain to get to the other side?
3:22 3:31 FEMALE:  Um, I mean, you, you take the 17, so you're very much just going--yeah, yeah.  Right in between the valley of, kind of, a lot of hills and stuff. 
3:31 3:33 MALE:  Sorry. I'm not, not really familiar with the area and stuff. 
3:33 3:53 FEMALE:  No.  I'm still not.  It's hard to get to Santa Cruise, but, uh, yeah, it's a beautiful place, I think.  I like--it's where I like to go when it's--when I feel like it's getting hot here because it's always cooler down there, even though it's the beach, so that's fun.  And, uh, my sister and her husband live in Berkley, so could see them a lot, which is nice.  They're close by. 
3:53 3:57 MALE:  I'm, uh, currently living with my brother and, and his wife. 
3:58 3:58 FEMALE: Oh, great. 
3:58 3:59 MALE:  So [unintelligible] commute every day. 
4:00 4:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, I almost thought about going to Berkley for grad school and living with my sister and her husband, but then I decided to stay here.  
4:08 4:09 MALE:  You made a good choice.  This is a great place. 
4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a nice place. 
4:12 4:13 MALE:  So, um--
4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  So what are your hobbies?
4:15 4:19 MALE:  [unintelligible] pretty similar to you, watch a lot of movies [unintelligible]--
4:19 4:20 FEMALE:  Yeah?  What's the last movie you saw in theater?
4:21 4:21 MALE:  Hitch. 
4:22 4:22 FEMALE:  Hitch.  
4:24 4:24 MALE:  Will Smith?
4:24 4:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, no, I didn't see it. 
4:25 4:27 MALE:  Teach that guy how to dance. 
4:27 4:31 FEMALE:  Right.  The previews were funny.  I sort of felt like maybe I got the gist of the movie from the previews, though. 
4:32 4:39 MALE:  It seemed, like--I know, like, a lot of people think that Will Smith movies are kind of dumb, but--and they are, but, like [unintelligible] this one's actually, uh, quite a good movie. 
4:39 4:39 FEMALE:  Okay. 
4:40 4:40 MALE:  You should watch it. 
4:40 4:44 FEMALE:  It's the kind of movie I like.  I tend to like that movie.  I mean, not that movie, but movies like that.  
4:46 4:47 MALE:  Okay.  But you should check it out.  Definitely. 
4:46 4:48 FEMALE:  I will.  Okay.  Thanks. 
4:54 4:54 MALE:  I gotta go. 
4:55 4:55 FEMALE:  Okay. 
4:55 4:56 MALE:  Pleasure meeting you.
4:56 4:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was nice meeting you.
