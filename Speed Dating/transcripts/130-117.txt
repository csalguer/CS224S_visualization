0:13 0:15 MALE:  Nice to meet you, too.  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  How are you holding up?  
0:16 0:32 MALE:  I'm still hanging in there.  She gave me some Teddy Grahams so that gave me a boost.  [laughter] So, uhm, so how's things going?  
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  What department are you in?  
0:35 0:36 MALE:  The law school.  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  What?  
0:37 0:37 MALE:  Law school.  
0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  Ah, cool.  I'm philosophy.

0:42 0:49 MALE:  Philosophy, okay.  Oh, so how's [unintelligible] mostly education law actually.  
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  What's that?  
0:50 0:51 MALE:  What's that?  
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:52 1:36 MALE:  Well, what I've been doing is a lot of different things you can do with that, but I've been certain--I work in--we have a clinic.  We help kids who basically are poor, and they can't afford a lawyer, but they're getting--something is happening in their school whether they--I had a kid who was, he was dropped from this program by mistake, and then they couldn't go back to school.  And they were telling him he couldn't come to the school anymore because the only reason he was at the school was because he was in this program he had been in since kindergarten.  He was in high school now.  And so they wouldn't let him back to school.  This was like a technicality.  So, I helped him get back into school.  They were making a mistake.  
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  Making [unintelligible].  
1:37 1:48 MALE:  Yeah, and then this other kid, he needed to be put in a different school because he couldn't--the school he was at couldn't help him.  So, I helped him get into another school, and then--
1:39 1:41 FEMALE:  [interposing] These poor people are not like us.  
1:55 1:56 MALE: You help people understand.  
1:46 1:48 FEMALE: Let's talk about what you [unintelligible] with people too.  
2:00 2:05 MALE:  Exactly. So, you tell us what we should do, and then we should go do it. So, if it weren't for you we would have--
1:55 2:03 FEMALE: He's a wreck.  I can hardly keep from talking about it.  We should tell them how to do better.  
2:14 2:16 MALE: See, we wouldn't know what to do if we didn't have you, so--
2:06 2:09 FEMALE:  But nobody listens.  
2:18 2:20 MALE: Really, what are you doing?  Are you getting a PhD?  
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:21 2:31 MALE:  What are you working on?  
2:12 2:20 FEMALE:  I want to bring it to those minds [unintelligible] identified self identity--
2:31 2:31 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
2:22 2:24 FEMALE:  --yeah, with ethics.  
2:35 2:36 MALE:  Yeah.  That is very interesting.  
2:26 2:44 FEMALE:  So, how should I live my life even if I am [unintelligible], something I love.  So--but I like [unintelligible].  
2:55 2:56 MALE:  Yeah, it's hard to get into law school.  
2:46 2:48 FEMALE:  No, they don't have the money.  They don't have the--
3:00 3:00 MALE:  They won't give you loans or anything?  So, but what about philosophy?  It cost, well because are you--
2:58 3:09 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Really we could [unintelligible].  You can be a foreigner and get financial aid for anything else apart from [unintelligible].  
3:21 3:23 MALE:  Why?  That's so weird.  
3:12 3:15 FEMALE:  You need to pay.  
3:27 3:30 MALE:  Why?  Do you have any idea why? 
3:20 3:41 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  I don't know if it's the correct way.  I have no idea, but if you are rich, you can take it.  It doesn't mean you [unintelligible].  
3:52 3:53 MALE: Yeah, okay.  
3:43 3:46 FEMALE:  I am [unintelligible].  
3:57 4:01 MALE:  Yeah, you've got to be really rich.
