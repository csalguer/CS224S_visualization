1:42 2:06 FEMALE: I read a lot of fiction. I just finished this book called Water Ship Down. It's about a bunch of rabbits. I know it sounds really stupid but they're really cute. The warren is getting destroyed because someone is coming to file the land and develop where they used to be. So this bunch of ten rabbits have to head out and find a new warren. So they go over brooks and fields and the like.
2:07 2:09 MALE: Right. So it's kind of like a paradigm of life?
2:09 2:17 FEMALE: Yeah. And it's kind of like 100 yards is a huge deal for a rabbit. It's very funny. You watch them and they are like Hmm? So it's great.

2:53 2:55 FEMALE: Okay. I know somebody there, well a couple of people.
2:57 3:08 MALE: Yeah. So I'm going to do business development there. So pretty psyched about it. I'm double E undergrad so that's why I was asking about what you're doing in CS. It's always kind of cool to talk to engineers and CS people, they are like, oh, that's me back in the day.
3:09 3:12 FEMALE: Yeah. I think you can only do it for so long and then it's kind of time to do something else.
3:12 3:17 MALE: Yeah. It's different for different people. I have friends who are PhD double E here. And I'm like holy shit, what are you doing? Yeah.
3:18 3:28 FEMALE: Yeah, that's not something I think I can do either. It's fun for a little while and then you're like, I just can't. I've got to talk to some people, I can't talk to the computer.
3:31 3:33 MALE: Yeah. But I love it here. I'm glad I'm staying in the area.
3:34 3:35 FEMALE: Did you go to undergrad here, too?
