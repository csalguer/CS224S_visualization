0:01 0:02 MALE:  Are you "O"?  
0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  I am "O".  
0:03 0:03 MALE:  Hi.  
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:07 0:08 MALE:  Hey, I'm male104.  
0:08 0:09 FEMALE:  female135, nice to meet you.  
0:10 0:12 MALE:  You too.  Are you having fun?  
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  It's like hard.  
0:15 0:16 MALE:  It's a lot of work, right?  
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  I think so.  
0:17 0:17 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  What do you do?  
0:18 0:20 MALE:  Computer science.  You?  
0:21 0:23 FEMALE:  Education in the doctoral program.  
0:23 0:26 MALE:  Cool, is everyone that you meet computer science?
0:27 0:32 FEMALE:  No, I think I only met one.  Yeah, thanks.  
0:34 0:36 MALE:  Only girls get water?  What's up?  
0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  You want one?  
0:37 0:44 MALE:  I don't even want it.  I don't even like water.  It's the political point.  
0:46 0:52 FEMALE:  So, these are the people that convinced me to do this.  They are in my classes.  So, I blame them.  Anyway.  
0:52 0:54 MALE:  Are you going to take revenge?  
0:55 1:02 FEMALE:  No.  Although I was talking bad about her into this microphone because someone is going to have to listen to all of these.  
1:03 1:04 MALE:  Really?  They're going to listen to all of them.  
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  Well, that's what the plan was.  
1:07 1:08 MALE:  That's horrible.  I wouldn't want to do that at all. 
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  It's their Master's project.  
1:12 1:13 MALE:  It's like worse than doing it is listening to it.  
1:13 1:16 FEMALE: Unless like you feel bad for the people maybe. I don't know.  
1:17 1:18 MALE:  I mean I'm sure it's funny to listen to them.  
1:18 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  So, are you here for [unintelligible] or?  
1:23 1:25 MALE:  No, I'm a Master's guy.  
1:26 1:27 FEMALE:  What are you interested in?  
1:27 1:34 MALE:  I don't even like computer science to tell you the truth.  I studied English for undergrad.  
1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:37 1:40 MALE:  I don't know Just maybe like another year of it.  So--
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  At least it's short.  
1:41 1:43 MALE:  I don't know.  It's okay.  
1:43 1:51 FEMALE:  In undergrad one of my good friends was in computer science, and I was in political science.  And we were like, okay, well if it has to say science in its name, there's something wrong with it.  
1:52 1:52 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:52 1:54 FEMALE:  Like Physics isn't called physics science.  
1:55 2:01 MALE:  That's true because computer science is actually engineering, and they say science to make it sound like it's a science.  But it's not.  
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Right.  
2:02 2:13 MALE:  Yeah, I totally think like physics and pure sciences are [unintelligible] than engineering.  But I think computer science is like the closest to a science.  So, 
2:15 2:18 FEMALE:  So, what do you like to do when you're not computer sciencing?  
2:18 2:20 MALE:  I like to sit out in the grass and play guitar.  
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Cool.  
2:21 2:22 MALE:  I try to do a lot of that.  
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:24 2:25 MALE:  What about you?  
2:25 2:38 FEMALE:  I like to go for walks, and I like listening to music a lot too.  But I don't play anything right now.  I went to [unintelligible].  I just went to a good show in the city a couple of weeks ago, and it's like I want to do more of that.  
2:38 2:39 MALE:  Which show is it?  
2:40 2:42 FEMALE:  Gander Mountain Swing Band.  They're bluegrass.  
2:43 2:44 MALE:  That sounds cool.  
2:45 2:47 FEMALE:  They're a little--they're a little rock, you know.  
2:47 2:51 MALE:  Are you into like--what's that guy?  Um, what's that guy that plays the banjo?  
2:52 2:55 FEMALE:  Like Al Scruggs or Doc Osmond.  
2:56 3:12 MALE:  Oh, I don't know those.  I was thinking of something else.  There's like this guy that plays the banjo and he has a really weird base player who plays drums on his base.  Like he has this specially built base guitar so he only plays like the--he plays the notes with one hand and plays the drums with his other hand.  
3:13 3:13 FEMALE:  No.  
3:14 3:18 MALE:  I forget the band's name, but it's like this really famous like it's like bluegrass world music stuff.  
3:19 3:32 FEMALE:  I would just add I've been to the bluegrass [unintelligible].  So, it's funny because it seems like bluegrass is a really local scene as much [unintelligible].  You know, it's not so much national.  
3:33 3:34 MALE:  Is that where you went to college?  
3:35 3:37 FEMALE:  I did a Master's there, but I went to college at Berkley.  
3:38 3:39 MALE:  Oh cool.  
3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  Where did you do your's? 
3:41 3:42 MALE:  University of Florida.  
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  Oh.  
3:43 3:45 MALE:  So, you went to Berkley, and then you went--
3:46 3:46 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:46 3:48 MALE:  So, you like California a lot?  
3:48 3:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:50 3:50 MALE:  Okay.  
3:50 3:52 FEMALE:  So, yeah.  Are you from Florida originally?  
3:53 3:57 MALE:  I was born in New York, but yeah, so I moved to Florida when I was pretty young.  
3:58 4:02 FEMALE:  My best friend did the very [unintelligible].  She was born in Florida and moved to New York when she was like five.  
4:02 4:07 MALE:  Well, it seems like the reasonable thing to do.  I don't know why anyone would move to Florida, but [crosstalk].
4:07 4:08 FEMALE:  It was nice to meet you, male104. 
4:08 4:08 MALE:  You too.
