0:04 0:05 MALE: Nice to meet you.

0:05 0:06 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, too.

0:06 0:09 MALE: Would you like to go first, or have me do it first?

0:09 0:11 FEMALE: Give you a synopsis of myself?

0:12 0:14 MALE: Sure, if you'd like.  [unintelligible] a few questions or anything.

0:14 0:15 FEMALE: I'm in the Slavic department.

0:15 0:16 MALE: In the which?

0:16 0:16 FEMALE: Slavic.

0:16 0:16 MALE: Oh.

0:17 0:20 FEMALE: Um, actually I don't know if we're actually supposed to start yet.

0:20 0:21 MALE: [unintelligible]

0:21 0:22 FEMALE: But whatever.

0:22 0:23 MALE: Yeah, why don't you -

0:23 0:33 FEMALE: I'm a first-year PhD. Um... yeah, I graduated college in '99, I've been working since then, so I'm really glad to be back to school.

0:33 0:35 MALE: Congratulations on the -- getting into the PhD department.

0:35 0:35 FEMALE: Thank you.

0:36 0:37 MALE: It usually -- always takes a bit of work [laughter].

0:37 0:43 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, I'm really happy.  It was uh -- this is definitely my dream school for that program, so...

0:44 0:51 MALE: Well, let's see, um, I am just about finishing up, uh, finishing my engineer's degree. In December I turned in my thesis.

0:52 0:52 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

0:52 0:53 MALE: And I --

0:54 0:54 [Background Noise]

0:55 0:55 FEMALE: Okay.

0:56 0:57 UNIDENTIFIED LAWRENCE SPEAKER: Don't start yet. [unintelligible].

0:58 0:59 FEMALE: [laughter]

1:00 1:07 MALE: Oh, well. So on a sidelight, uh, what -- how did you find out about this?

1:08 1:09 FEMALE: Oh, I know nameX [phonetic].

1:09 1:09 MALE: Oh, okay.

1:09 1:09 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:10 1:10 MALE: So it - 

1:11 1:12 FEMALE: I did -- I did one of these back in February -

1:12 1:12 MALE: Oh, okay.

1:13 1:17 FEMALE: - and uh, and then I also [phonetic] decided to do research on it, so...

1:17 1:18 [Background Noise]

1:18 1:19 MALE: Oh, [unintelligible].

1:20 1:25 FEMALE: So yeah, so I just agreed to come to support her research and stuff.

1:25 1:25 MALE: [unintelligible].

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Yeah. How about you.

1:27 1:31 MALE: I thought this sounded [unintelligible], and I spend most of my time in the lab and don't usually poke my head out - 

1:31 1:31 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:32 1:35 MALE: - this mail [phonetic] up -- just came out, and I thought, "Oh, that'd be awfully interesting."

1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:36 1:37 MALE: Now with the thesis done, I can relax.

1:37 1:38 FEMALE: What's your thesis on?

1:39 1:47 MALE: It's on actually use of ultraviolet light to take electrostatic charge off of this piece of metal that floats in space.

1:47 1:47 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:48 1:55 MALE: Which I had already taken [unintelligible] mentioned, so all kinds of forces, but uh -- but yeah, and it was a good thesis.

1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:56 1:58 MALE: At one point I got their signatures, which is the important thing.

1:58 1:58 FEMALE: Good.

1:58 1:59 MALE: So it's quite nice.

2:00 2:01 FEMALE: What are you going to do next?

2:01 2:10 MALE: Well, right at the moment I'm still working on the same project, hopefully to continue doing some [unintelligible] because I've always kind of like the research.

2:10 2:10 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:11 2:13 MALE: And it [unintelligible].  And we'll see what happens from there.

2:13 2:13 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:14 2:15 MALE: I'm interested in whatever, you know, might come along.

2:15 2:16 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:17 2:18 MALE: Whatever [unintelligible].

2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Good.

2:20 2:26 MALE: But, uh... let's see.  A little bit about myself.  I grew up in Colorado.

2:26 2:27 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:27 2:35 MALE: On a farm, just a kid in the middle of nowhere. Uh, the town was about 25 [unintelligible], we actually had one stoplight.

2:35 2:35 FEMALE: Nice.

2:36 2:38 MALE: Uh, yeah.  But it did stay on all day.

2:39 2:39 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:40 2:46 MALE: Uh, I really enjoyed it.  Um... my youngest [phonetic] is about three.

2:46 2:46 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:47 2:59 MALE: Let's see.  What, uh -- I guess in general you actually get the chance to have fun as a PhD candidate?

3:00 3:02 FEMALE: Yeah, I do, actually.  I'm just taking classes right now.

3:02 3:02 MALE: Mm-hmm.

3:03 3:08 FEMALE: I -- the first two -- it's a Master's and PhD, so the first two years are just classes, and it's pretty mellow.

3:08 3:08 MALE: Very well [phonetic].

3:09 3:27 FEMALE: Yeah, so... yeah, I'm taking three classes this quarter.  Two of them are kind of on medieval Russian literature and language, and then one on literature since the death of Stalin to the present, and uh, I really like one.  I like -- I think I'm going to focus on modern stuff for my dissertation, and um...

3:27 3:29 MALE: And how modern is "modern"?

3:29 3:30 FEMALE: 20th century.

3:31 3:31 MALE: Okay.

3:32 3:40 FEMALE: 19th century.  Yeah, 20th century, mostly.  But I think -- I think I really want to do moderner, like maybe last half of the 20th century to the present, you know.

3:41 3:43 MALE: Maybe around 70s, early 80s [unintelligible] to now, with all the changes.

3:44 4:08 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Or maybe even 50s, you know?  Um, 'cause what we're studying right now, you know Russian literature written in, like, you know kind of Stalin era, Soviet era, you have to read between the lines, you know?  There's lots of things being said that aren't directly being said, because that's the only way to get it past the censors.  So that presents some interesting problems as far as analyzing, and the techniques that they would use to kind of get their ideas across -

4:09 4:09 MALE: Right.

4:10 4:10 FEMALE: - and stuff, so...

4:10 4:12 MALE: I bet you have to be careful not to read your own interpretation of some of -

4:13 4:13 FEMALE: Yeah.

4:13 4:15 MALE: - of something, yeah.  That sounds interesting, yeah.

4:15 4:15 FEMALE: Yeah.

4:16 4:19 MALE: So what's sort of a typical Saturday, Friday night?

4:19 4:21 FEMALE: Oh, gosh, I don't really have one.

4:21 4:23 MALE: Do you go out to do some -- great location like [unintelligible]?

4:23 4:30 FEMALE: Well, I just -- I spend time with friends, and um, I don't know, nothing really -- just kind of hanging out and spending time with people.

4:30 4:31 MALE: Right.

4:31 4:36 FEMALE: It's been nice.  I've, uh, made some good friends.  It's mellow.  I spend a lot of time at Starbucks reading.

4:36 4:38 MALE: Ah.  You mean like - 

4:38 4:39 FEMALE: I've spent a lot of money at Starbucks.

4:39 4:40 MALE: Yeah, it's amazing how -

4:40 4:40 FEMALE: [laughter].

4:41 4:43 MALE: - [unintelligible], it seems to become a -- one of the major food groups, yeah.

4:44 4:45 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.

4:45 4:46 MALE: [unintelligible].

4:47 4:49 FEMALE: And uh, yeah, I don't know.

4:50 4:52 MALE: Anything you'd like to -- to ask?

4:52 4:55 FEMALE: Um... what's your typical Friday/Saturday night?

4:55 5:02 MALE: I usually, when I finally do get out of the lab about 7 or 7:30, I go home and I try to relax.

5:02 5:04 FEMALE: Do you live off campus or on campus?

5:04 5:05 MALE: I do, uh.

5:05 5:06 [Background Noise]

5:07 5:08 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

5:08 5:09 MALE: It was a pleasure to meet you.
