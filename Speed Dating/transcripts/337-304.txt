1:17 1:18 MALE:  What kind of job are you looking for?

1:19 1:22 FEMALE:  Research sciences or just anything not academia.

1:23 1:25 MALE:  Not academia.  Why not?  Why not, I mean, you're--

1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  I'm not interested.

1:26 1:26 MALE:  You're not interested.

1:27 1:44 FEMALE:  No, I--I just know I don't want to work at a lab, I don't want to--I just don't want to go with [unintelligible] out.  So, [unintelligible] like biotech companies or a government research institute or even non-science.  I'm pretty open to other stuff.  Yeah, so, yeah.

1:44 1:48 MALE:  That's good.  That's great.  Um, well, when--when did you come over here to the states?

1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  Thirteen years ago.

1:51 1:51 MALE:  Fourteen?

1:52 1:53 FEMALE:  Thirteen or something like that.

1:53 1:54 MALE:  Oh, my God.  Okay.  

1:54 1:55 FEMALE:  It's been a while.

1:55 1:56 MALE:  Okay.

1:57 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I think it hasn't been that long [unintelligible] 1992 I think.  Yeah, it's been a while and California I've been here for like three or four years.  And out of the three places I lived, I think I like California best.  No snow.

2:08 2:08 MALE:  Okay.

2:09 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, just don't mention snow at all.

2:11 2:11 MALE:  Okay.

2:12 2:14 FEMALE:  Are you planning on moving back to New York City when you're done?

2:14 2:17 MALE:  No.  I'm probably going to stay out here.  I--I've had enough of New York City.

2:17 2:18 FEMALE:  Really?

2:18 2:23 MALE:  So--yeah.  So, I don't know I--I think it's just much better here.

2:23 2:24 FEMALE:  You mean weather wise or...?

2:24 2:28 MALE:  Like people--weather wise, people are nicer, um, a lot more opportunities.  A lot of--a lot of reasons.

2:29 2:32 FEMALE:  That's true for electrical engineering, right?

2:32 2:38 MALE:  Oh, yeah definitely.  Yeah, definitely.  I'm actually thinking about--I'm trying to get people together to start up some kind of business.

2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

2:39 2:46 MALE:  So, that's--that's like one of the reasons I want to go to grad school so I can get--you know, I--I heard a lot about--about Stanford being like, you know, the entrepreneurial kind of school so.

2:46 2:47 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

2:47 2:48 MALE:  I'm trying to get people together.

2:48 2:50 FEMALE:  So, do you think you will go to business school or maybe not?

2:51 2:55 MALE:  I don't know if I could afford business school.  I mean, um, I--I'd like to--

2:55 2:56 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] eventually maybe.

2:56 2:59 MALE:  I don't know it's just--yeah.  I think I need to get some more money first.  I'll see.

3:00 3:05 FEMALE:  But your first year--so how long does it usually take in your program to finish a Ph.D.?

3:05 3:07 MALE:  Um, how long does it take?  It takes like--

3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  The average.

3:08 3:08 MALE:  --like five, six years.  

3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  So, about the same for--for--for like for me too.

3:11 3:11 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.

3:12 3:13 FEMALE:  So--

3:13 3:16 MALE:  So--so you--you've been here and you--do you like it here or...?

3:16 3:18 FEMALE:  You mean do I like Stanford or California? 

3:18 3:19 MALE:  Well, let's just say California in general.

3:20 3:46 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  I--I do 'cause I do have a lot of college friends from the areas, a lot from the computer sciences.  So, I think they all [unintelligible] and I've been to Silicon Valley already.  And I do have some family here and the weather is nice, the food is good.  There is nothing--not much to--well, accept for high living cost.  Other than that, nothing to complain about.  And going home is a lot closer too [unintelligible] in the past [unintelligible] to the Midwest you have to--another few more hours of flight.  So, now this is good.  Yeah, I do like California.

3:46 3:47 MALE:  So, are your parents Hong Kong?

3:48 3:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, and my sister used to live in Sacramento, but she moved back too so.  

3:51 3:51 MALE:  Okay.

3:52 3:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, I--I do like California though.  I might eventually move back, I don't know I haven't decided yet.

3:59 4:00 MALE:  Okay.  Well, good.

4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Well, nice meeting you, male304.
