0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Hi, sorry about that.
0:14 0:15 MALE:  Hi.  My name's male109.
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  female123.  Nice to meet you.
0:16 0:16 MALE:  Nice to meet you, female123.
0:10 0:12 FEMALE:  So the obligatory question, what department are you in?
0:22 0:23 MALE:  [laughter] Uh, I'm in electrical engineering.
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  I met someone else in electrical engineering.
0:26 0:26 MALE:  There's a lot of us.
0:18 0:22 FEMALE:  Didn't I?  I don't know.  Someone engineer.
0:30 0:30 MALE:  Tonight or?
0:23 0:25 FEMALE:  Mm-hmm.  Is there someone here that you recognize?
0:34 0:39 MALE:   I didn't recognize someone. When I talked them into recording this, there was at least like two or three [unintelligible].
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  How big's your program?
0:43 0:51 MALE:  It's a big program.  I think they have about--I don't know.  I think last year, they had at least, at least 200 or more.
0:44 0:47 FEMALE:  How many--is it a master's program or...
0:55 0:57 MALE:  Uh, I'm undecided between a master's and PhD. 
0:50 0:52 FEMALE:  They let you--they let you in without letting you--
1:00 1:13 MALE:  So basically in [unintelligible] the way they do their [unintelligible] with [unintelligible] it's very brutal, in which they only allow 50% every time of people that take the qual [phonetic] to be able to get--
1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  They only let what?
1:14 1:16 MALE:  50% people that take the qualification exam.
1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:17 1:35 MALE:  To be able to be admitted.  Always, no matter--it's a very clear cut.  So uh, they'll keep--rank people and then, 50% [unintelligible].  So it's a very brutal--it's a very, uh, different from other departments, which you get direct application programs.
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  So why--
1:37 1:44 MALE:  But you can indicate, but you can indicate if you're under the PhD.  But still, uh, afterwards, the qual is what matters.
1:37 1:40 FEMALE:  So why would you come to Stanford if it's not--it's so brutal?
1:50 2:01 MALE:  That would be the Stanford name recognition and, uh, the area. I've been here before and I think it's one of the best areas I've ever been to.
1:53 1:54 FEMALE:  Oh, do you want to live in the Bay Area?
2:03 2:08 MALE:  Uh, I want, yeah, I want.  [unintelligible].  So what school you in?
2:00 2:01 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.
2:10 2:15 MALE:  Oh, law school?  So are you doing the joint one or just law school?
2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  No, no.  I'm just doing law school.
2:15 2:16 MALE:  So what makes you want to do law school?
2:09 2:23 FEMALE:  Why do I want to do law school?  Um, I think it's--well it's a very interesting area.  And I think that there's so much that you can do with the law.  I mean, it's amazing how much the law affects everything.  And I think it's such a powerful tool to have, you know.
2:31 2:34 MALE:  What was your background before you decided you wanted to do law school?
2:27 2:32 FEMALE:  I was a philosopher.  I was at graduate school down at UCLA, the philosophy program.
2:40 2:42 MALE:  Oh, I see.  You were into philosophy [unintelligible].
2:35 2:39 FEMALE:  I was going to get my doctoral, [unintelligible] doctor's degree.  But I quit after my master's.
2:49 2:49 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:41 2:42 FEMALE:  I'm a failed grad student.
2:51 2:51 MALE:  I see.
2:44 2:48 FEMALE:  I'm technically on leave, so I can go back if I want to.  But yeah, we're not so sure about that.
2:57 3:11 MALE:  Yeah.  On leave is such a good term, like, because even the [unintelligible] Google founders, when they put in their bio, they always put they are on leave [unintelligible] [laughter]. I don't think they're ever going to come back.
3:06 3:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:15 3:21 MALE:  So from philosophy to law school, how did you know you wanted to do law school instead of business school or--
3:14 3:19 FEMALE:  Oh, I'm not a B-school person at all.  I'm not.  I'm not a wheeler or dealer.  That's just not me.
3:27 3:28 MALE:  Why do you want to law school?
3:21 3:38 FEMALE:  And I think the issues in law school are just--I think the issues in law are very, very interesting.  I mean, I don't find making money to be particularly interesting, whereas like, issues in law, I mean, you know, there's civil right's issues and issues about women and gays and disability rights and stuff like that, that are just fascinating, whereas--I don't know.  It's stuff that I care about.
3:46 3:49 MALE:  Uh-huh. So uh, what do you plan to do after law school?
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Work [laughter].
3:51 3:53 MALE:  I mean, as an attorney, lawyer or--
3:45 3:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:54 3:55 MALE:  --some kind of corporate, is the word?
3:47 3:53 FEMALE:  Not a corporate lawyer, but as a lawyer.  So.  Um--
4:01 4:05 MALE:  So what's the most, uh, influential philosopher [unintelligible]?
3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  Oh, that's a hard question.
4:07 4:14 MALE:  [unintelligible] hard question?  It was nice meeting you, female123.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you too, male109.
