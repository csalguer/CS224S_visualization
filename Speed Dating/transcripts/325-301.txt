0:00:11.1 0:00:11.5 MALE:  Yeah?
0:00:10.9 0:00:14.5 FEMALE:  It's actually not as awkward as I thought it was going to be. [laughter] I have to say.
0:00:13.5 0:00:15.4 MALE:  [laughter] It's really just meeting people right? 
0:00:14.9 0:00:15.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:15.9 0:00:25.3 MALE:  I- I had it kind of easy. I had one- I met one person but then my two friends were next and then I had the blank seat.  So I haven't really had any- I haven't had any real dates yet, so you're like my first.  [unintelligible] 
0:00:23.2 0:00:27.0 FEMALE:  Oh So how are things going with you?
0:00:27.5 0:00:34.0 MALE:  Yeah, it's going all right. It's a- it was a fun day today. I had a wind surfing class, so anytime you have wind surfing it's a good day.
0:00:33.1 0:00:36.1 FEMALE:  Do you surf at- not like- [unintelligible] or no? 
0:00:35.8 0:00:37.0 MALE:  No. [laughter] 
0:00:36.0 0:00:38.0 FEMALE:  Because, uh, it's like [unintelligible] 
0:00:37.6 0:00:43.4 MALE:  Yeah, take a puddle, right? I wanted to name the- the new GC- the grad center bar that's going to open up. 
0:00:43.0 0:00:43.4 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:00:43.3 0:00:46.0 MALE:  I want to name it Lake Log because it's all- it's wetter than Lake Log.
0:00:45.2 0:00:45.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:45.9 0:00:53.5 MALE:  Because they always keep it moist. But, um, but I think they used to do it at Lake- Lake Log and now they do it at the Salt Lake which is like up Alpine Road. 
0:00:53.1 0:00:53.6 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:00:53.5 0:01:00.2 MALE:  And then it's just- it's really close.  Like it's just up in the Farmer's Fields up there and like you can still see the Dish from where it is and stuff.  But it's awesome.  [unintelligible] 
0:00:56.8 0:00:59.8 FEMALE:  Cool.  How did it go?
0:01:00.1 0:01:09.6 MALE:  Yeah, I had so much- actually today was- there was no wind. So it kind of sucked.  I was kind of stuck in the middle of the lake for a while. [laughter] I had to end up- end up like practically swimming to shore because there was no wind.
0:01:10.7 0:01:13.1 FEMALE:  That's cool.  I never have thought about it.  Yeah.
0:01:11.8 0:01:16.6 MALE:  Yeah.  That is fun.  So what about you? What's one fun thing you did today?
0:01:16.4 0:01:23.4 FEMALE:  What's one fun thing I did today. Let's see. We had a lot of- we had a barbeque. 
0:01:24.1 0:01:25.6 MALE:  Oh.
0:01:25.1 0:01:33.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And we- and then we played volleyball. I- I- I actually work now so today was one of those days that we had a company meeting/volleyball picnic thing.
0:01:34.1 0:01:35.8 MALE:  Wow. With you co- co-workers.
0:01:35.2 0:01:36.1 FEMALE:  With the co-workers.
0:01:36.4 0:01:39.1 MALE:  So you're out of grad school already and you're- you're doing the work thing?
0:01:37.5 0:01:39.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:01:39.0 0:01:41.4 MALE:  Nice. What are you- what- what department were you in?
0:01:40.9 0:01:42.0 FEMALE:  I was in the CS department.
0:01:43.0 0:01:43.9 MALE:  And now what's your job?
0:01:43.6 0:01:48.0 FEMALE:  I work at a start up called Ingrien Networks. They do, um, data encryption stuff.
0:01:48.7 0:01:50.1 MALE:  How are you connected to Stanford still?
0:01:49.6 0:01:55.8 FEMALE:  Um, my sister actually goes to school here.  So she was like well you can come along. I was like okay.
0:01:53.7 0:01:57.8 MALE:  Great.  Great. Cool.
0:01:57.1 0:01:59.4 FEMALE:  It's cool.  It's nice to come back.
0:01:58.6 0:02:01.7 MALE:  Um, do you- were you in the graduate school here or just undergrad?
0:02:01.2 0:02:02.9 FEMALE:  Um, I did a co-term so.
0:02:03.1 0:02:04.6 MALE:  You did the co-term, nice.
0:02:04.5 0:02:05.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's fun.
0:02:05.8 0:02:07.0 MALE:  The one year Master's. 
0:02:06.6 0:02:07.0 FEMALE:  Yep.
0:02:07.2 0:02:10.9 MALE:  That's where Stanford gets all of their money I think from their master's students.  I think the co-terms [unintelligible].
0:02:09.3 0:02:15.5 FEMALE:  They totally do. Yeah, it's like when you are a co-term they're like, okay, you can TA and not pay but like for the industry people-
0:02:16.1 0:02:19.1 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  Do you like your job all right?
0:02:18.7 0:02:20.4 FEMALE:  I like it. Yeah. I do like it.
0:02:20.7 0:02:23.4 MALE:  Good people to play volleyball with?  That's all you can really ask for.
0:02:21.4 0:02:29.3 FEMALE:  Yes, good people.  It's funny because we have all the engineering geeks.  And so then like we have all the- when we play against the marketing people and then the marketing people always kick our butts.
0:02:31.0 0:02:31.9 MALE:  The marketing people always-
0:02:31.3 0:02:32.9 FEMALE:  Always kick our butts. [laughter]  
0:02:32.3 0:02:35.7 MALE:  Oh really?  Oh, what can you do?
0:02:35.4 0:02:35.8 FEMALE:  Exactly.
0:02:35.5 0:02:39.6 MALE:  You know?  They don't really have- marketing, what is that? They probably spend all their time playing volleyball.
0:02:37.2 0:02:41.6 FEMALE:  [laughter] I don't know.  What department are you from?
0:02:42.3 0:02:43.6 MALE:  I'm in the teacher education program.
0:02:43.0 0:02:43.7 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.
0:02:43.7 0:02:53.7 MALE:  So this is my building.  And I spend a lot of time here.  Way too much time. [unintelligible] I like it a lot.
0:02:45.3 0:02:54.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Cool. What kind of school do you want- or what kind of grades do you want to teach?
0:02:55.3 0:02:56.2 MALE:  I'm going to teach high school math.
0:02:55.9 0:02:56.8 FEMALE:  That's awesome.
0:02:57.0 0:03:05.2 MALE:  Yeah. It's really cool. I feel like- and I feel like I've learned so- uh, really a lot this year about- about what math is- like what teaching math can look like. 
0:03:04.6 0:03:05.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:04.9 0:03:14.0 MALE:  You know, like there's just so many- like it's not- I don't want to- I didn't want to teach the way I wanted- I learned, you know.  And I don't want to teach in like a private school or like a suburban public school-
0:03:12.3 0:03:12.8 FEMALE:  Right.
0:03:13.7 0:03:20.9 MALE:  -where anything you do is fine.  You know, like- 'cause the kids [unintelligible]. I want to teach kids who don't usually have good teachers.
0:03:20.6 0:03:21.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  That's awesome.
0:03:22.4 0:03:24.6 MALE:  So I came here and it was really good.  It's really supportive.
0:03:24.4 0:03:32.1 FEMALE:  I do some work for, uh, the web site for Wellenbrookhall, uh, skill, Center for Innovative Center for Something Learning or whatever.
0:03:29.1 0:03:29.6 MALE:  Okay.
0:03:32.1 0:03:37.1 FEMALE:  So I- I've definitely seen a lot of that teaching in technology and stuff. It's pretty cool.
0:03:38.4 0:03:48.1 MALE:  Yeah. Technology is kind of one of those things in the classroom like it's- it's like back and forth. It's like, you know, like some things that can really be helpful with, but then sometimes it's like too much of a crutch for students to learn.
0:03:47.1 0:03:48.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Definitely.
0:03:47.8 0:04:02.6 MALE:  Or sometimes you have to spend too much time- put a lot of effort into make- into learning the technology and then to be able to use it too, which is- it's another thing, though. It's another gatekeeper down there because schools are responsible for teaching kids. They have to be able to word process in science and stuff, which is different than you know- 
0:04:00.8 0:04:01.8 [horn]
0:04:02.0 0:04:02.4 FEMALE:  Right.
0:04:04.0 0:04:05.2 MALE:  It should have been their original intent.
0:04:04.7 0:04:05.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04:06.4 0:04:07.7 MALE:  Anyway, it was good to talk to you, female325.
0:04:06.4 0:04:07.5 FEMALE:  It's very nice to meet you male301.
0:04:07.7 0:04:08.7 MALE:  Uh, good luck.
