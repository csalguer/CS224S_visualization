Ah, went to [unintelligible] School as a high school student, in Palmetto.  Major is--I mean in college--was culture anthropology.  Doing my second masters in education.  My first is um, back in the east coast.  Um, my focus right now is higher education issues women of color are facing when they're applying to prestigious graduate schools, such as the ones here.  Um, I'm, I'm an artist.  I'm a dancer, poet, um, writer, comedian.  Not that like I say those in big letters.  I just do it for fun.  I think that's, that's, that's the true, the true pleasure of art is not, not to get all obsessed with, you know, um, just, I don't know.  Just like all this formality and like, like, I don't know.
