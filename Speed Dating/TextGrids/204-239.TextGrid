And I evaluated it and they, I got great responses and like just overwhelming, like, can you make more, can you do that, you know.  We want to see more.  And so, writing this proposal for a curriculum grant to see, evaluate the effects of using this medium to help teach difficult concepts, engaging for the students like, you know learn better.
