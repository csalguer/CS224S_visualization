And it just kind of like--I think those issues need to be addressed.  And so that's the deep side of me.  And then the less deep side of me is that I'm--not less deep, but that was pretty intense stuff to share--but like the other part is I'm very artistic and passionate and sensitive.  And my friends know I give 150% to them.  Sometimes that's [unintelligible] telling me I should hold back.  But it's just I'm a very passionate--um, what's the word, um, like, whatever--and wholesome person.  And I like to make, I like to make art.  I like to comment on the culture I                       live in all the time through digital video, camera work.  I like to do documentaries, drawing, painting, dancing.
