0:00 0:01 FEMALE: Hi.
0:01 0:02 MALE: How are you doing?
0:02 0:04 FEMALE: Good. I feel like I have to hurry.
0:11 0:13 MALE: We have to do intermission or something.
0:16 0:16 FEMALE: I feel like Darth Vader.
0:18 0:28 MALE: Exactly. I can't make another smile, I'm too tired. I don't like anyone, I want to go home. It's probably going to take forever.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE: [laughter] That's funny. I'm female325.
0:31 0:31 MALE: male311.
0:32 0:32 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:32 0:32 MALE: How are you doing?
0:32 0:33 FEMALE: Good.
0:34 0:35 MALE: So what do you study here?
0:36 0:40 FEMALE: I'm a computer science major but I graduated 2001 so I've been out in industry for...
0:40 0:40 MALE: Where do you work?
0:41 0:48 FEMALE: I work at a place called Ingrian Networks. They do data encryption and security. It seems to be a good market.
0:48 0:51 MALE: Encryption. So you like have a secret about what you guys do?
0:52 0:57 FEMALE: Not that secret. They sell a thing and it encrypts the data as it goes through it, then it decrypts it as it comes back through it. So it's kind of cool.
0:58 1:05 MALE: That's cool. That's like the hot area, encryption. It was especially hot five years ago and I think everyone that was doing encryption went...
1:06 1:06  FEMALE: Out of business?
1:06 1:15 MALE: Yeah. And then slowly it's coming. Now that people really need the security, it's good to have the encryption people back. Let's hash.
1:16 1:16 FEMALE: What do you do?
1:17 1:25 MALE: I did an MBA and now I'm doing electrical engineering. Actually I'm doing a sort of EE but it's really CS.
1:26 1:27 FEMALE: Do you know male311 Bonet?
1:29 1:29 MALE: No.
1:31 1:31 FEMALE: He's the encryption data CS guy.
1:32 1:36 MALE: He probably encrypted everything even this conversation.
1:37 1:39 FEMALE: He's like I don't actually exist and he's little bips and he camoflauges into the wall. [laughter]
1:40 1:44 MALE: You don't know me. My name is 101011. Good luck in encrypting that.
1:45 1:46 FEMALE: [laughter] That's funny.
1:47 1:56 MALE: And in EE I'm doing assistance. But actually I don't have an undergraduate degree in engineering or CS.
1:57 1:58 FEMALE: That's okay.
1:58 2:02 MALE: So I'm actually taking lots of intro classes right now. I'm actually 107 here.
2:02 2:06 FEMALE: Really? There's really not? Jerry Cain?
2:06 2:06 MALE: Yes.
2:07 2:11 FEMALE: [unintelligible]
2:12 2:14 MALE: She had a baby, I had her for 106.
2:14 2:14 FEMALE: She's cool.
2:14 2:15 MALE: She's pretty cool. Jerry Cain is a little insane.
2:16 2:19 FEMALE: He's crazy, he's totally nuts.
2:20 2:29 MALE: He uses words like fursnickety [phonetic] too much, did you notice that? The compiler is a little fursnickety. I'm like compilers are not fursnickety. Who uses fursnickety.
2:30 2:31 FEMALE: You're weird.
2:32 2:35 MALE: Yeah, exactly. He always goes hmm, you know how he does that?
2:36 2:37 FEMALE: Yeah, he does.
2:38 2:42 MALE: I feel like when I write an email to him I should go fursnickety. A fursnickety question.
2:44 2:44 FEMALE: Hmm. [laughter]
2:45 3:00 MALE: But it's funny because he comes up with these assignments. [unintelligible] and they go on forever, like the never ending assignment. I don't know. We took 107.
3:01 3:06 FEMALE: That was a long time ago. I think that-- well 108 is hard, too. But 107, 108 are definitely the hardest.
3:07 3:07 MALE: Oh. Is 108 hard as well?
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: It's hard. Actually I think it's eas--
3:11 3:13 MALE: Which is harder? Aren't those harder than 140?
3:14 3:14 FEMALE: No.
3:14 3:14 MALE: 140 is harder?
3:14 3:16 FEMALE: 140 is harder. How's that?
3:16 3:18 MALE: Really? I'm scared of 140.
3:18 3:22 FEMALE: Maybe you should find somebody with past assignments.
3:23 3:36 MALE: Yeah. There you go. And be like, yeah, the operating system. So in terms of encryption what kind do you do? Do you encrypt product?
3:37 3:46 FEMALE: I actually do more of the user interface stuff so it's how people would set it up and draw pictures really.
3:37 3:58 MALE: I worked part time at Veritas software. So actually I sit right next to the usability group. Those people, there's so much demand for their services it's ridiculous. You get an engineer and they're like.
3:59 4:02 FEMALE: They're like, I want this to.
4:02 4:10 MALE: It's funny because every year they show these worst of our messages. One says.
4:11 4:13 FEMALE: Shows a little box with an X on it.
4:14 4:16 MALE: One has the box that says everything seems to be okay.
4:17 4:20 FEMALE: [laughter] That's great. So why is it not working?	
4:21 4:27 MALE: Exactly. You just sort of find it. So I don't know. I think it's [horn]. Whoa, that's insane
4:28 4:30 FEMALE: I think it got louder, maybe I just sit here right next to it.
4:32 4:32 MALE: Nice to meet you.
4:33 4:33 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, male311.
