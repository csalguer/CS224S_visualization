0:00:02.0 0:00:02.4 MALE:  Hi.
0:00:04.3 0:00:04.8 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:00:02.6 0:00:03.7 MALE:  Are you female138 or-
0:00:05.4 0:00:07.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Sometimes it's a little hard to read [unintelligible] 
0:00:04.9 0:00:06.6 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] I'm male111.
0:00:07.2 0:00:07.9 FEMALE:  Just move it down.
0:00:08.3 0:00:14.6 MALE:  [unintelligible] this is like where it's supposed to be but I'm not really that concerned.  [laughter]  Yeah, I'm like-
0:00:14.4 0:00:17.3 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  Mine totally flaked out.  I went, uh-oh [unintelligible] 
0:00:14.3 0:00:18.8 MALE:  -yeah, the better they- that want- that wants to hear what I have to say like the more comfortable I am-  
0:00:19.7 0:00:22.2 FEMALE:  But this is like for research's sake.  Come on.
0:00:19.9 0:00:26.7 MALE:  It- it is for research.  But I'm like this is- I think the survey things are like weird because like they make you fill them out quickly and then sort of like-
0:00:28.8 0:00:29.8 FEMALE:  It's first impression right. 
0:00:27.8 0:00:28.4 MALE:  Right.  Right.
0:00:30.1 0:00:31.2 FEMALE:  It's speed dating.
0:00:28.9 0:00:37.1 MALE:  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.  I don't know if I guy that concept of like, uh, like, um, first impressions seem like, uh [unintelligible] because- that's what this whole study like is trying to figure out right [unintelligible] 
0:00:39.2 0:00:43.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, but that's unfortunately how I think a lot of people live their life.  
0:00:39.6 0:00:40.8 MALE:  [laughter] Right.  Right.
0:00:42.9 0:00:45.9 FEMALE:  You know, oh, she's cool.  She's not.  He's cool.  He's not.
0:00:44.2 0:00:52.1 MALE:  Yeah.  That- it's kind of unfortunate that I feel like- I mean it depends on like [unintelligible] based on more than first impressions, but, uh, but-
0:00:53.6 0:00:56.7 FEMALE:  Right.  But it-- it's human, right?  It's like animalistic nature.
0:00:54.4 0:00:54.8 MALE:  Right.
0:00:56.4 0:00:59.2 FEMALE:  -you can kind of tell if the fruit is like rotten inside.
0:00:56.9 0:00:58.0 MALE:  Right.  Right.  [laughter] 
0:00:58.9 0:01:02.2 FEMALE:  -or not.  It's just like okay, it's red enough or nah, it's kind of brown.
0:00:59.0 0:01:02.6 MALE:  Right.  Yeah, I- we're hard wired to think this way, right?  So- 
0:01:04.2 0:01:04.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:02.6 0:01:04.1 MALE:  [unintelligible] but-
0:01:05.6 0:01:07.1 FEMALE:  So, what do you study?
0:01:05.2 0:01:07.8 MALE:  Uh, I'm in the political science department.  Um--
0:01:09.8 0:01:10.4 FEMALE:  What science?
0:01:08.5 0:01:09.5 MALE:  Uh, political science.
0:01:11.5 0:01:12.1 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
0:01:09.9 0:01:14.2 MALE:  Yeah.  I'm a third year in the program, or trying to get a PhD but, uh, we'll see how it goes.   
0:01:15.1 0:01:15.6 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:14.1 0:01:16.1 MALE:  Uh, which- which program are you in?
0:01:17.9 0:01:19.0 FEMALE:  I'm in electrical engineering.
0:01:17.1 0:01:19.3 MALE:  How do you have-- how's it going so far?  Uh-
0:01:21.1 0:01:26.3 FEMALE:  It's okay.  We have a la- a really large department and they kind of- sometimes they lose track of how many grad students they have.
0:01:24.3 0:01:25.1 MALE:  Oh, that's not good.  
0:01:27.5 0:01:27.9 FEMALE:  So--
0:01:25.1 0:01:29.2 MALE:  That doesn't sound particularly, uh, responsible of them.  Uh- 
0:01:31.1 0:01:36.8 FEMALE:  No, it makes you feel anonymous.  So it's nice, you can kind of like explore things without them keeping tabs on you. 
0:01:34.8 0:01:37.2 MALE:  Right.  And that's a good thing.  Right? [laughter]  
0:01:38.9 0:01:39.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:37.2 0:01:38.8 MALE:  Uh, what year are you?  
0:01:40.7 0:01:41.3 FEMALE:  First year.
0:01:39.1 0:01:41.8 MALE:  Okay.  So are you working toward a PhD or-
0:01:43.7 0:01:48.0 FEMALE:  I'm not sure.  Like before I came I was so sure that I wanted a PhD and now I'm just having doubts.  
0:01:46.6 0:01:50.5 MALE:  And is it because of like this anonymity thing or is it because-
0:01:51.9 0:01:57.3 FEMALE:  It's because like I realize I'm getting older and like a PhD will take me like six or seven years- 
0:01:55.2 0:01:57.8 MALE:  Yeah, don't say that 'cause I'm [unintelligible] [laughter]
0:01:58.8 0:02:05.5 FEMALE:  Yeah, but if you're- if you know what you want, right- 'cause for me I still haven't- I'm still considering law school, business school, med school, art school- 
0:02:03.2 0:02:06.0 MALE:  Wow.  It's like the world is like really open. 
0:02:06.6 0:02:09.5 FEMALE:  The world is still open.  I haven't picked a major yet.  I'm just here.
0:02:07.0 0:02:15.3 MALE:  Right.  Right.  Wow, so what'd you study in- what did you study in school, uh- now did you- have you always studied engineering or like did [unintelligible]  
0:02:17.1 0:02:19.3 FEMALE:  Like what do you mean?  Like what kind of engineering? 
0:02:16.9 0:02:18.4 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like [unintelligible] 
0:02:19.7 0:02:21.1 FEMALE:  Well I studied electrical engineering-
0:02:18.9 0:02:19.4 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:20.8 0:02:22.2 FEMALE:  -mostly on optical physics. 
0:02:20.1 0:02:25.1 MALE:  Okay, so the- so that- that's like, uh, actual like- it's very applied then, right?  It's not, um- 
0:02:21.9 0:02:32.1 FEMALE:  For me it is technical art because like photography, where my other background is like, so-
0:02:28.7 0:02:33.0 MALE:  Oh.  And so why don't you want to be a photographer or--
0:02:34.8 0:02:37.4 FEMALE:  You can't-- my parents think you can't support yourself.
0:02:35.3 0:02:36.5 MALE:  Oh, yeah--
0:02:38.1 0:02:38.6 FEMALE:  So- 
0:02:36.3 0:02:41.7 MALE:  -well my parents don't think [unintelligible] is like a sustainable career.  [unintelligible] think that [unintelligible]  
0:02:43.4 0:02:45.8 FEMALE:  But you enjoy it and like that's- like what-
0:02:43.3 0:02:44.0 MALE:  It's nice.
0:02:45.6 0:02:51.3 FEMALE:  -like something you've narrowed down on.  I haven't narrowed down- I just don't want to pay like loans for a business school or law school or med school.
0:02:48.0 0:02:55.3 MALE:  Right.  But I think it's important to like go to like, uh, like a grad program like that knowing pretty much why you want to be there.  But I mean you can get a master's here- 
0:02:55.8 0:02:58.6 FEMALE:  Of course for my department doesn't want to hear like that I'm not sure. 
0:02:56.3 0:03:00.7 MALE:  [laughter] Right.  Well they're not gonna listen to these tapes, so like, uh, they- they will-
0:03:02.4 0:03:03.6 FEMALE:  Hopefully you know. 
0:03:00.5 0:03:03.5 MALE:  -they won't know.  Are- are you from around here or-
0:03:05.3 0:03:05.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:04.2 0:03:06.3 MALE:  Like the Bay area or like Palo Alto?
0:03:07.8 0:03:12.6 FEMALE:  I'm a Bay area native.  And I went to Berkeley and I went down to here so- 
0:03:10.0 0:03:10.4 MALE:  Right.
0:03:12.5 0:03:14.2 FEMALE:  -where else, uh, have you been?
0:03:12.0 0:03:14.3 MALE:  Oh I'm from Michigan, uh, originally. 
0:03:15.5 0:03:16.1 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:14.1 0:03:19.1 MALE:  And, uh, I went to- um, I went to school in- in Boston and then I, uh-
0:03:20.7 0:03:21.2 FEMALE:  Which school?
0:03:19.1 0:03:21.6 MALE:  Harvard, uh, Cambridge area.  
0:03:23.6 0:03:24.3 FEMALE:  See-
0:03:21.5 0:03:27.5 MALE:  My sister just like left there and, uh, she'll like, yeah, I'm glad to be leaving like this cold place.  She's in the south now.
0:03:29.5 0:03:33.8 FEMALE:  Oh, I really want to go there.  It's like most of my friends are at MIT and at Harvard so like--
0:03:31.4 0:03:31.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:34.4 0:03:35.0 FEMALE:  -I think-
0:03:33.0 0:03:34.0 MALE:  Why do you really want to go there?

0:03:41.0 0:03:43.8 FEMALE:  I- I don't think-  I think it's way too hot here.  Berkeley was okay. 
0:03:40.5 0:03:42.0 MALE:  But you're a native Californian right?
0:03:43.8 0:03:44.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:03:44.6 0:03:45.2 MALE:  Really?
0:03:47.6 0:03:49.7 FEMALE:  Thirty to fifty is like the best range.
0:03:47.4 0:03:48.9 MALE:  So you want snow?  Like, I mean-
0:03:51.0 0:03:52.3 FEMALE:  I don't really want it wet.  I don't-
0:03:49.5 0:03:53.5 MALE:  -it's zero like for two months of the year [unintelligible] 
0:03:55.1 0:03:57.8 FEMALE:  Okay, so like I know my tolerance range is negative ten-
0:03:55.7 0:03:56.3 MALE:  Right.
0:03:58.4 0:03:59.0 FEMALE:  -to ninety.
0:03:56.8 0:03:57.5 MALE:  Right.
0:03:59.5 0:04:02.2 FEMALE:  And I'd rather be sitting in the middle around thirty or forty-
0:03:59.4 0:04:00.0 [horn]
0:03:59.9 0:04:00.4 MALE:  Okay.
0:04:02.5 0:04:06.3 FEMALE:  -than like sprawled out on eighty degree like weather right now.  It's like-
