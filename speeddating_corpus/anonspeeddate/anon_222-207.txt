1:49 1:50 MALE: I'm a third-year, electrical engineering.

1:51 1:51 FEMALE: Okay.

1:51 1:55 MALE: So -- so anyway, I was going to say before, to make fun of engineers, which is one of my favorite things to do -

1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Okay, okay.

1:56 1:57 MALE: 'Cause like you probably are used to the kind of people that have some social -- degree of social skills or whatever.  You might be getting some engineers coming through -- not to like rip on them or anything here, but you know.

2:04 2:05 FEMALE: Hey, I have a lot of engineering friends, but go on.

2:08 2:15 MALE: And I am one, if you ever want the red button - no, I mean it's like -- I mean, I don't know, because I haven't met any guys, but I imagine that you probably get the occasional, like, pretty awkward one coming through.

2:17 2:17 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:20 2:20 MALE: Wow, I'm sorry.  [laughter].

2:21 2:22 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:22 2:28 MALE: Wow, what are you going to think of me?  Go away!  No, um, so yeah, where were we?  Oh right, so one year.  Would you -- what were you doing before this?

2:29 2:30 FEMALE: Uh, I was working.  I was working in San Francisco.

2:35 2:36 MALE:  Okay.  SoCal girl.

2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, SoCal girl.  Yeah, where are you from?

2:38 2:39 MALE: I'm from Virginia, near D.C.

2:39 2:39 FEMALE: Oh.

2:40 2:44 MALE: I'm an East Coaster, until I came here, but now I love it here, but now I love it here.

2:44 2:45 FEMALE: Wait so -- how have you - engineering, how long have you been...?

2:46 2:50 MALE: I'm in my third year, so...

2:48 2:49 FEMALE: Third year, okay.  You like it out here, you might want to go back?

2:49 2:55 MALE: I do.  I can't see any reason I'll go back, I mean in the technical I'm in the technical, so there's a lot jobs for stuff out here, like it layaway.  So there's also a lot more jobs and stuff out here, but -

2:54 2:54 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:56 2:58 MALE: - like it's also just nice.

2:57 2:57 FEMALE: Yes, the weather's nice.

3:00 3:00 MALE: It is. How about you, do you think you'll stay, live here or L.A.?

3:05 3:05 FEMALE: Yeah, I love California, yeah.  I don't think I can imagine living anywhere else.

3:06 3:07 MALE: Did you go to college down there?

3:06 3:10 FEMALE: I went to college at Berkeley, so I've been up here for eight years.

3:10 3:10 MALE: Ooh, Golden Bears.

3:10 3:10 FEMALE: Yes.

3:11 3:11 MALE: Have you switched your allegiance yet?

3:12 3:13 FEMALE: No, I'm still loyal.

3:14 3:14 MALE: What year did you graduate?

3:15 3:16 FEMALE: I graduated in 2000.

3:16 3:16 MALE: Okay.

3:19 3:19 FEMALE: Yeah, so ... yeah.

3:18 3:20 doing the working thing, the high paid job suMALE: So you've been working since then, kind of doing the working thing?  The high-paying job thing?

3:21 3:22 FEMALE: No, high-paying -- education?  More like the low-paying jobs.

3:26 3:26 MALE: Were you -- you were teaching? 

3:27 3:27 FEMALE: Uh, I taught for a year.

3:28 3:28 MALE: Okay.

3:28 3:30 FEMALE: And then I did administration and [unintelligible].

3:31 3:31 MALE: What, high school?

3:31 3:31 FEMALE: No, little ones.  

3:33 3:33 MALE: Little guys.

3:35 3:35 FEMALE: Um, 4th graders.

3:35 3:35 MALE: Okay, cool.

3:37 3:37 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:37 3:40 MALE: My sister -- my Mom teaches pre-school, and then my sister -

3:39 3:39 FEMALE: Oh, uh-huh.

3:42 3:46 MALE: - my sister, I think, is going to go high school but she actually has played with the idea of young kids like that.

3:46 3:46 FEMALE: Okay, cool.

3:48 3:50 MALE: 4th graders, cool.  I actually -- I coached a team of 12-year olds in basketball.

3:50 3:50 FEMALE: Oh, you did?

3:52 3:53 MALE: Yeah, this winter.

3:52 3:52 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

3:53 3:53 MALE: Like through Sunnyvale in Los Altos [phonetic].

3:53 3:54 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

3:54 4:03 MALE: And it's cool because I think 6th grade is a good age because it's like they still -- so, I feel like I'm young and like a little older kids might kind of question me, -

4:01 4:01 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

4:04 4:07 MALE: - but they're still young enough that they respect your authority and -

4:06 4:08 FEMALE: Yeah, but old enough to have conversations with them.

4:08 4:09 MALE: - old enough to like be a real person.

4:10 4:11 FEMALE: Yes.

4:10 4:11 MALE: That's beautiful.  I think 4th graders must be fun.

4:12 4:12 FEMALE: Yeah.

4:13 4:13 MALE: Well, sorry it was short.

[Background Noise]

4:15 4:17 MALE: Making fun of engineers.  But, you know, maybe you can forgive me.

4:17 4:17 FEMALE: [laughter].  It was nice meeting you.

4:18 4:18 MALE: Good to meet you.
