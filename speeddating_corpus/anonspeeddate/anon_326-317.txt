0:02 0:02 MALE: Hi.
0:02 0:03 FEMALE: Keep writing, keep writing [laughter].
0:05 0:07 MALE: If you go one more [unintelligible].  Let's go.  How are you?
0:07 0:09 FEMALE: Good.  [unintelligible].  Yes.
0:10 0:10 MALE: female326.  Okay my name's [unintelligible].
0:11 0:11 FEMALE: Hi [laughter].
0:11 0:14 MALE: And so, uh, what are you up to?  Where are you?
0:15 0:17 FEMALE: Um, I'm in material science department.
0:18 0:18 MALE: Okay.
0:18 0:18 FEMALE: Engineering.
0:19 0:19 MALE: Okay. 
0:20 0:21 FEMALE: [unintelligible] to build solar cells.
0:22 0:22 MALE: Oh really?
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:23 0:24 MALE: Okay.  So in computer science--
0:26 0:26 FEMALE: Material science.
0:26 0:30 MALE: Material science, you're in material science.  Okay.  Cool.  So do you work for a master's or somebody--
0:30 0:31 FEMALE: Yeah. I'm in the master's program right now.
0:32 0:35  MALE: Okay.  Cool.  And uh, who's your advisor?
0:36 0:38 FEMALE: Uh, Bruce Clemmins.  He actually doesn't [unintelligible].
0:39 0:39 MALE: Yeah.
0:39 0:39 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:39 0:40 MALE: He does fuel cells.
0:40 0:40 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:41 0:41 MALE: Those are two of my big interests.
0:42 0:42 FEMALE: Oh really?  That's very co
0:43 0:47 MALE: I actually did a degree with fuel cells, not with solar electricity, but with fuel cells, electric vehicles.
0:47 0:49 FEMALE: Oh that's very cool.  Yeah.  What, uh, department are you in now?
0:50 0:55 MALE: Now I'm in electrical engineering.  I work in computer architecture.  For a while I was-- 
0:55 0:55 FEMALE: Oh wow.  That's very different.
0:56 0:56 MALE: [laughter] That's right.  
0:56 0:56 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:56 1:03 MALE: I've been all over the place.  For a while, I was doing transportation engineering, civil engineering and uh, electric vehicles, fuel cells for [unintelligible].
1:03 1:04 FEMALE: Oh that's very cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.
1:05 1:05 MALE: Yeah.
1:05 1:08 FEMALE: That's good stuff.  [unintelligible] or master's?
1:08 1:10 MALE: Yeah.  So I've been here for a while.
1:10 1:11 FEMALE: Close to done?  Not close to done?
1:12 1:12 MALE: Yeah.  Close to done.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE: Okay.  That's good.
1:13 1:17 MALE: Hopefully finishing up in about year now, or less, maybe six months [laughter]. 
1:18 1:20 FEMALE: That's a long time [laughter].  [Unintelligibl
1:21 1:22 MALE: That's close, let me tell you.
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:24 1:25 MALE: When are you getting done?
1:26 1:28 FEMALE: Um, I'm going to be done next--end of next winter quarter.
1:29 1:29 MALE: Okay.
1:31 1:32 FEMALE: So it's kind of a fast program.  It's like five quarters.
1:33 1:34 MALE: Five quarters.  Okay.
1:34 1:34 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:35 1:37 MALE: So end of winter.  End of fall or winter. 
1:37 1:37 FEMALE: End of winter.
1:38 1:40 MALE: Okay.  Then, uh, what do you want to do?
1:40 1:45 FEMALE: Um, I don't know.  I actually just interviewed with Google this morning for a marketing position.
1:45 1:45 MALE: Okay.
1:46 1:50 FEMALE: So we [unintelligible] something that could work.  I wouldn't say work is ever fun.
1:51 1:51 MALE: Yeah.
1:51 1:57 FEMALE: But, um, so maybe that, if not, I don't know I'm going to be sick of engineering or not.  Or I don't know.
1:57 1:58 MALE: That's great.
2:00 2:00 FEMALE: Have to see what happens.
2:00 2:01 MALE: So that's kind of different from material science, huh?  [unintelligible].
2:01 2:03 FEMALE: Yeah, it really is.  It is.
2:03 2:04 MALE: You didn't want to go out in that area?
2:04 2:13 FEMALE: Um, I don't know.  I just--I mean, it's kind of hard because--to kind of keep working with the solar cells and stuff.  You kind of have to be in a clean room all the time.
2:13 2:13 MALE: Yeah.
2:13 2:18 FEMALE: And it's hard to kind of sign my life away to multiple years of daily clean room work [laughter].
2:19 2:19 MALE: The clean room is bad.
2:19 2:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's really, really bad.  The funny suits kill me [laughter]. And there are people who are in there all the time, you know, six, seven hours.
2:28 2:29 MALE: Yeah.  It's definitely a job to avoid.
2:30 2:30 FEMALE: You have to love it.
2:31 2:31 MALE: Yeah.
2:31 2:32 FEMALE: Absolutely love it.
2:32 2:40 MALE: I took, one course from the clean room, and that was enough for me.  You know, never sit down, never touch anything, always feel uncomfortable, wonder what just got through your [unintelligible].
2:40 2:43 FEMALE: And you're super bored for like five hours.
2:43 2:44 MALE: [laughter] Yeah, that's right.
2:44 2:46 FEMALE: And then there's like 30 seconds when you're terrified 'cause of the HF that you have to use [laughter].
2:47 2:50 MALE: Yeah. [laughter] That's right. You should go right to the closet and [unintelligible].
2:50 2:54 FEMALE: You're like, don't kill me.  It's awful.  I couldn't do it.  But [laughter].
2:54 2:58 MALE: Yeah.  It's terrible.  Well I'm glad you moved out of that.
2:58 3:03 FEMALE: Yeah.  So now I'm kind of like, well what do I do?  'Cause the stuff I really liked doing [unintelligible], you know.  So.
3:04 3:06 MALE: So what do you do in your free time?  What kind of things?
3:06 3:06 FEMALE: Um, I ride horses.
3:07 3:07 MALE: Ride horsesOkay.
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: Yes.  A lot.
3:08 3:09 MALE: Cool.
3:09 3:10 FEMALE: So um, yeah.
3:11 3:12 MALE: So here at Stanford or you have some other place you go to?
3:12 3:18 FEMALE: It's another place.  I used to ride at the barn here.  But they're remodeling.  So everything's kind of in a tizzy.
3:18 3:18 MALE: Okay.
3:19 3:19 FEMALE: But.
3:20 3:20 MALE: Giving the horses a makeover, huh [laughter]?
3:22 3:30 FEMALE: Yeah.  They kind of tore down the entire barn, and we were like, "Okay, where are the horses going to go now?"  And they're like, "Somewhere else." [laughter] But yeah.  What about you?
3:31 3:36 MALE: Me? Uh, [unintelligible] I don't have that much time off.
3:37 3:37 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:37 3:43 MALE: But when I do, I watch a movie.  I like to browse on the internet and learn new things, you know?
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
3:43 3:45 MALE: I always like to learn something new, so.
3:45 3:45 FEMALE: That's good.
3:45 3:50 MALE: Yes.  I spend a lot of time just reading up on factual sort of information.
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: Like what?
3:53 3:56 MALE: Like some topic will strike me that I have to learn about.  What was the topic--
3:56 3:57 FEMALE: [laughter] What'd you learn today [laughter]?
3:57 3:59 MALE: Today was bedbugs.  I suddenly saw a thing about--
3:59 3:59 FEMALE: Bedbugs?
4:00 4:05 MALE: Yeah. How hotels are getting the bite due to bedbugs because [unintelligible] people--travelers are going and getting bitten.
4:05 4:05 FEMALE: Oh no.
4:06 4:12 MALE: Even high class hotels.  [unintelligible] I had to know more about bedbugs [laughter].  I learned quite a lot.
4:13 4:13 FEMALE: [laughter] That's quite interesting.
4:16 4:16 MALE: Not the usual kind of thing.
4:17 4:17 FEMALE: Ye
4:17 4:18 MALE: Well nice meeting you.
4:18 4:19 FEMALE: Nice to meet you too.
