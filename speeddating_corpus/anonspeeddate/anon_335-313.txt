0:00 0:16 FEMALE: I [unintelligible].  Hi, I'm female335. 
0:01 0:02 MALE: Hi, I'm male313.
0:17 0:18 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:03 0:05 MALE: Nice to meet you.  How are things going for you here?
0:19 0:19 FEMALE: Good. 
0:06 0:06 MALE: Yeah?
0:20 0:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  My day's picking up.
0:07 0:08 MALE: Have you done this before?
0:22 0:23 FEMALE: I haven't.  No. 
0:10 0:11 MALE: I did it a couple times. 
0:25 0:26 FEMALE: Yeah?  What'd you think?
0:13 0:15 MALE: It was okay.  I met some [unintelligible] speed dating. 
0:28 0:37 FEMALE: Oh, yeah?  Oh, I remember her telling--she lives in my building.  She was telling me about when she did it.  Yeah.  It seems like this Stanford environment is a nice, like, friendly environment [unintelligible]. 
0:23 0:28 MALE: I think so. Yeah, I mean, everybody here seems pretty normal.  Well, except for a few people.
0:42 0:43 FEMALE: [laughter]
0:29 0:30 MALE: I won't go into that.
0:44 0:45 FEMALE: [laughter] 
0:32 0:36 MALE: But, apparently people don't date at Stanford.  I don't know.  I read an editorial in the paper [unintelligible].
0:48 0:52 FEMALE: Yeah.  I was an under grad here, and it's sort of true.
0:37 0:52 MALE: Oh, really?
0:52 1:01 FEMALE: Well, so I have--I have a lot of theories on this, but, um, I think a lot of it is that you can't walk places, so you spend a lot of time, like, alone in a car driving somewhere.  And even if you wanna see a mainstream movie, you drive, like, 20 minutes and--I think--I think what--at least in college, what we used to complain about is that there isn't a lot of semi-casual dating.  It's, like, you're either--
1:02 1:03 MALE: Yeah, that's what I've heard. 
1:17 1:19 FEMALE: There's nowhere between off and high. 
1:05 1:09 MALE: You're either, like, hooking up or you're, like, married.  You're like, "What the fuck?"
1:21 1:27 FEMALE: Exactly.  That's exactly--yeah.  Yeah, all of a sudden, you're in a six-month relationship and you don't really know what happened.
1:13 1:13 MALE: That's interesting.
1:28 1:32 FEMALE: Yeah, but I think it has to do with the suburban surrounding area a lot. 
1:20 1:30 MALE: Let's see.  This editorial talked about dorms being the big thing.  Everybody does stuff with their dorm.  You can't date people in your dorm, so your whole social circle is kind of off limits.  I don't know.  Did you find that here?
1:44 1:53 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  It's just--it's especially if you're the type of person who's maybe a little bit private.  You know, it's just hard for anything to be going on without everybody knowing about it. 
1:39 1:40 MALE: Yeah. 
1:54 2:03 FEMALE: Especially because even after your first year, you've lived with your friends.  You, you know, you're blocking groups or [unintelligible] groups or whatever.  So you still know the same people.
1:50 1:54 MALE: All right.  Well, here's a noble attempt at more dating on campus.  I don't know. 
2:08 2:22 FEMALE: Yeah, no, totally.  I--you know, I find in grad school, at first it was hard for me to kind of transition into just socializing in my department because I had a lot of friends still in the area.  But it's hard to meet new people.  So that's sort of what I thought.  I was like, "Oh, this is great.  You can meet a lot of people at once."
2:08 2:09 MALE: What department are you in?
2:23 2:25 FEMALE: Biology.  Yeah. 
2:10 2:14 MALE: Okay, cool. So I'm in CS where there are very few women.
2:28 2:33 FEMALE: Yeah.  [laughter]  I was an under grad applied math major, so I spent a lot of time in CS. 
2:18 2:19 MALE: So you know how that is.  Yeah.
2:34 2:37 FEMALE: Yeah, I enjoyed it because I--you know, I'm the only girl in the class.
2:22 2:28 MALE: Well, the ratio was in your favor.  Exactly.  Exactly. Like, socializing within the department is kind of pointless.  
2:42 2:43 FEMALE: Oh.
2:29 2:32 MALE: At least in terms of meeting, you know, I don't know.
2:45 2:48 FEMALE: Yeah. Well, the life sciences is more 50/50.
2:34 2:36 MALE: Yeah, I'm so jealous of the life science guys. 
2:50 2:53 FEMALE: [laughter]. You should come tell them.  I don't think they know how good they have it. 
2:40 2:42 MALE: I don't know.  Maybe they don't wanna date people in their program?
2:57 2:58 FEMALE: Yeah, it's a catch-22.
2:42 2:46 MALE: Because they spend so much time together.  I've heard people say things like that. 
3:01 3:01 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:47 2:51 MALE: It's be like dating a, a sister or something because you're spending all this time on all your assignments. 
3:05 3:10 FEMALE: Yeah. Well, it'd be like dating someone in your dorm.  It's just, you know, you can't walk by their office without saying hi.
2:57 3:00 MALE: Yeah, and then you break up, and it's super awkward.
3:14 3:20 FEMALE: Yeah. Actually, my cohort, there are two couples dating, and it's like, definitely changed the dynamic between that--everybody because it's--
3:06 3:09 MALE: Yeah, because now there's these two people who are closer to each other than anyone else.
3:23 3:32 FEMALE: Yeah, and it's--I mean, our cohort's small.  There are only nine of us, so if, like, both the couples are doing their own thing, it's, like, me and four other guys.  And we're sort of like, "So."
3:18 3:19 MALE: Yeah, that's interesting.
3:33 3:34 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:20 3:22 MALE: Maybe you should just pick the best one.
3:37 3:40 FEMALE: [laughter]  Maybe. So what are you studying in CS? Do you like it?
3:27 3:28 MALE: I like it, yeah.  I'm doing verification.  
3:43 3:43 FEMALE: Okay.
3:29 3:31 MALE: So, like, proving correctness of programs. 
3:45 3:49 FEMALE: Oh, that's neat.  You should come do your work on my programs, which are not correct [unintelligible].
3:36 3:43 MALE: Well, no programs are correct.  I mean, to a first approximation, every program has bugs.  So hopefully that will keep me employed for a very long time. 
3:57 4:01 FEMALE: Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, my constant gripe is that the computer isn't smart enough to know what I mean. 
3:47 3:49 MALE: Oh, the DWIM feature.  Do what I mean.
4:03 4:06 FEMALE: Yeah, exactly.  I'm like, "You know.  You know I meant to put a semicolon there."
3:52 4:04 MALE: Some languages have that.  I had a prof in under grad that told a story that he left out, like, a semicolon.  He went to get coffee, and when he came back, the program had put in the semicolon and run the program. What? 
4:18 4:20 FEMALE:  I think the grad student had done that or something. 
4:06 4:07 MALE: I don't know.  It's pretty crazy.  
4:21 4:21 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:08 4:08 MALE: Anyway, good luck.
4:22 4:23 FEMALE: It was nice to meet you.
4:09 4:09 MALE: Nice meeting you.
4:23 4:24 FEMALE: Um hm.
4:10 4:10 MALE: Take it easy.
4:24 4:25 FEMALE: You too.
