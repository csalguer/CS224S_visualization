0:24 0:25 MALE:  I'm electrical engineering. 

0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  I don't think I met you. 

0:27 0:27 MALE:  Do you live in Rains [phonetic]? 

0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  No. 

0:28 0:29 MALE:  Okay, my imagination [laughter].  Completely my imagination. 

0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  No, I think I have a really common face because other people tell me "I know you" and I'm like "no."  It happens to me all the time. 

0:39 0:40 MALE:  Maybe you're just like so nice and smiling, people feel like they want to know you. 

0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  Yeah sure, yeah sure, sure.  That's nice.  Thank you.

0:49 0:49 MALE:  Okay.  And then what? 

0:50 0:52 FEMALE:  And then what?  And then -- 

0:52 0:53 MALE:  Is it one year, a one year thing? 

0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  It's one year, but I'm doing it in one year and a half.  I'm finishing in January. 

0:58 0:59 MALE:  Okay. 

0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  And after that life.  I don't know, looking for jobs, maybe -- I want to be looking for a job [unintelligible]. 

1:07 1:08 MALE:  Where would you go? 

1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  I would like to go to Africa.  I'm thinking about Africa. 

1:13 1:13 MALE:  Have you ever been to Africa? 

1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  I've been there, but I would like to get to know Africa better.  

1:16 1:17 MALE:  Is there anywhere you haven't been? 

1:18 1:19 FEMALE:  Australia [laughter]. 

1:20 1:21 MALE:  Really? 

1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  I've never been to Australia. 

1:21 1:22 MALE:  Is that the only continent? 

1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  The only continent. 

1:22 1:23 MALE:  Well, besides Antarctica. 

1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] to [unintelligible] yeah. 

1:26 1:27 MALE:  Huh.  I got to Asia for my first time last October. 

1:31 1:31 FEMALE:  Where? 

1:31 1:32 MALE:  I went to Hong Kong and Bali. 

1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  Wow, I would love to do that. 

1:35 1:36 MALE:  Yeah it was pretty cool.  I have a friend, one of my best friends from high school is working for an Asian Wall Street Journal in Hong Kong. 

1:39 1:39 FEMALE:  Wow. 

1:39 1:40 MALE:  So I went out -- well met her and a couple of her college friends and -- 

1:43 1:44 FEMALE:  How long did you stay there?  

1:45 1:46 MALE:  Not long enough, eight days. 

1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  That's okay.

1:48 1:49 MALE:  It was during school, so I kind of felt bad about it at the time. 

1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  But it's a big travel for eight days no?  It's like [unintelligible] you stay there two days, you wake up and then you -- 

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Although I went to Chile -- 

1:59 2:00 FEMALE:  Oh that's far. 

2:01 2:01 MALE:  Yeah. 

2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  How many days in Chile? 

2:03 2:04 MALE:  A year ago, there I was also like seven or eight days, but like -- it took me almost 24 hours to get there. 

2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  You're from America no? 

2:10 2:11 MALE:  Yeah. 

2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  This is really American, you've been -- you travel a lot and you -- like -- a European would never move like more than 12 hours of plane at least one month. 

2:20 2:22 MALE:  Yeah. 

2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  We're so lazy. 

2:23 2:24 MALE:  Well you're not lazy, it's just like we're so like work driven.  If somebody saw, went into a work and stuff, but -- I mean, I don't know.  I wish I had gotten more time to stay, but like it's during school and I just -- 

2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  You [unintelligible]? 

2:35 2:35 MALE:  What? 

2:35 2:36 FEMALE:  The problem is [unintelligible].  Oh no tell me not true. 

2:40 2:40 MALE:  I'm like any one else that I feel guilty, feel a little bit guilty when I'm not doing work and like -- we should probably take more time off, but -- 

2:47 2:48 FEMALE:  But you are working hard? 

2:48 2:49 MALE:  Hard, hard enough, but I do -- 

2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  But you have a sun tan, so you are outside. 

2:53 2:53 MALE:  I play basketball three days a week at least. 

2:55 2:55 FEMALE:  Oh so it means that you are not [unintelligible].  Okay. 

2:58 2:59 MALE:  That's why I'm in grad school, I guess if I was a harder worker I would be doing something like -- you know? 

3:02 3:03 FEMALE:  It's a PhD? 

3:03 3:04 MALE:  Yeah. 

3:04 3:04 FEMALE:  So which year are you in the PhD? 

3:06 3:07 MALE:  I'm in my third and probably three more. 

3:09 3:10 FEMALE:  It's six years? 

3:11 3:12 MALE:  It's not really a predefined amount of time, it's just kind of -- 

3:14 3:15 FEMALE:  Oh I don't know anything about PhD, I thought it was a [unintelligible]. 

3:17 3:18 MALE:  So in a lot of places it's four or five, for us it's almost always at least five because there's a heavy class load at the beginning, so you get your Masters first. 

3:26 3:26 FEMALE:  Okay.  

3:27 3:27 MALE:  But that takes at least a year and then kind of -- 

3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  So you will finish with that. 

3:30 3:31 MALE:  So -- 

3:31 3:32 FEMALE:  So now you're in the [unintelligible], so you're in the [unintelligible]. 

3:34 3:34 MALE:  Exactly. 

3:34 3:35 FEMALE:  Oh okay.  [unintelligible] because I know then. 

3:36 3:37 MALE:  But I think for me it's going to be six because I lost my advisor after one year, so I kind of lost a year.  I mean I got papers out of it and stuff, I feel good about it, but it set me back a little. 

3:46 3:46 FEMALE:  And what to you recommend?  I'm sure I'm not going to understand it, but I -- 

3:49 3:49 MALE:  No you will understand it.  I used to medical image processing for surgery. 

3:52 3:53 FEMALE:  Okay. 

3:53 3:53 MALE:  So like, but now what I do is kind of computer vision type stuff, so letting -- I mean -- 

4:00; 4:00 FEMALE:  Inside of the body? 

4:01 4:01 MALE:  So then this is -- no this is more like teaching machines to recognize objects and you see a bunch of pictures of cars and learn what a car looks like and then you go and like look at some scene and say -- 

4:11 4:12 FEMALE:  But that's for medical, the same in [unintelligible]. 

4:13 4:13 MALE:  No longer medical. 

4:14 4:14 FEMALE:  No, but in general, oh okay. 

4:16 4:17 MALE:  It was good to meet you female234. 

4:17 4:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.
