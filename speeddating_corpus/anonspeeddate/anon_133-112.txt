0:00 0:03 MALE:  Yeah, it's hard to know the sincerity [unintelligible]?

0:05 0:07 MALE:  I'm just [unintelligible].  
0:04 0:07 FEMALE:  Fine.  [laughter]
0:12 0:28 MALE:  female133, female133--that's hard.  Mine's hard.  Of course, you know, for me whereas for Koreans we don't distinguish [unintelligible] R if you haven't noticed.  
0:24 0:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, my last name has an "L" and an "R" in it also.  [laughter]  
0:33 0:37 MALE:  So, I mean in Korean language there is only one character.  
0:34 0:40 FEMALE:  Yeah, at first I was confused, and then I talked to my friend who is in language, and he's like, oh, it's [unintelligible].  [crosstalk]  That would be really hard.  
0:46 0:48 MALE:  So, you seem to have made it [unintelligible].  
0:45 0:45 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  
0:49 0:50 MALE:  So you have many Korean friends?  
0:46 0:50 FEMALE:  I have a couple, but I was talking to a friend who did linguistics actually.  
0:55 0:55 MALE:  I see.  
0:51 0:58 FEMALE:  And so I asked him about different languages.  And I have a couple of Japanese friends also in kind of the same situation.  
1:02 1:06 MALE:  I see.  So, what's your department.  
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  I'm in economics.  
1:07 1:08 MALE:  Economics.  
1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:09 1:10 MALE:  Which year?  
1:06 1:08 FEMALE:  I'm in my second year.  It's very hard.  
1:13 1:14 MALE:  Interesting, because I'm your neighbor.  
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  What?  
1:15 1:25 MALE:  I'm your neighbor.  [crosstalk]  [laughter]  
1:22 1:25 FEMALE:  I didn't think you did organizational behavior.  [laughter]
1:30 1:39 MALE:  No arbiter.  There's no free lunch.  Wow.  Well, my--I'm in my third year.  
1:36 1:38 FEMALE:  Okay.  You took Duffy's class?  
1:43 1:46 MALE:  I done that in the year 2003.  
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  Oh, the first year.  
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Second year.  
1:44 1:45 FEMALE:  Second year, okay.  
1:50 1:51 MALE: Yes.  So you are interested in finances?  
1:48 1:53 FEMALE:  No, I'm not interested in finances.  I'm interested in--I know some people who pick up this year.  
1:58 1:58 MALE:  I see.  
1:54 1:57 FEMALE:  I'm not saying this in our department.  [laughter]
2:02 2:03 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:00 2:04 FEMALE:  [laughter]  We all spend a lot of time with [unintelligible].  
2:08 2:20 MALE:  We have so many common friends between [unintelligible] and GSB.  My resistance here or your being [unintelligible] here will be known to the department.  
2:16 2:22 FEMALE:  Oh, I don't think so.  [laughter]  No, I'm [unintelligible].  
2:26 2:29 MALE:  You will break the hearts of guys over there.  
2:26 2:34 FEMALE:  I do IO stuff so I won't say it will be impossible.  I'm taking it right now, like [unintelligible] metric.  
2:38 2:40 MALE:  Uh-huh, 605?
2:36 2:36 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  
2:42 2:42 MALE:  605?  
2:40 2:47 FEMALE:  Something like that.  I mean 603 is--[unintelligible].  Yeah, it's just two to three papers that are all very [unintelligible].  
2:51 2:51 MALE:  I see.  
2:50 3:01 FEMALE:  I don't know.  Yeah, I mean moist of the people taking it now are in the [unintelligible] department actually, and so we've kind of had a couple of [unintelligible] writing on it. So, he's kind of assuming that we have [unintelligible].  
3:06 3:06 MALE:  I see.  
3:03 3:24 FEMALE:  It's nice to have the reading list and say, ah, I read a book [unintelligible].  Yeah, but it's actually interesting.  I don't know.  A lot of times in the economics department they try to have some very complex structural  models and that's not a very interesting question per se.  So, I think so far he has done a good job letting [unintelligible] questions.  
3:28 3:30 MALE:  So, you are a clinical person?  
3:28 3:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't think I'm smart enough to appreciate or understand theory.  
3:37 3:42 MALE:  Here comes the dilemma.  If you want to be a people person, you have to know the theory [unintelligible].  
3:39 3:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, like I've done game theory.  I've done [unintelligible].  But I don't want to experience [unintelligible].  
3:51 3:53 MALE:  So, what's your special area?  
3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  Industrial organizations.  
3:54 3:55 MALE:  IO.
3:51 3:51 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
3:56 3:59 MALE:  That's actually the best subfield.  
3:56 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's why I came here actually.  That's very true. 
4:03 4:06 MALE:  I see.  Nice meeting you.  
3:59 4:03 FEMALE:  Bye.  
4:07 4:07 MALE:  Yeah, bye.
