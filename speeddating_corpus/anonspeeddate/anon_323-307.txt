0:04 0:05 MALE: Hi I'm male307. Nice to meet you female323.
0:00 0:02 FEMALE: Hi. I'm female323. Good to meet you, male307.
0:08 0:11 MALE: Is this the last or no? Well not quite.
0:07 0:10 FEMALE: Well you get set up next so, yeah it is the last.
0:13 0:15 MALE: Oh. That's fun. How are you holding up?
0:12 0:18 FEMALE: It's an inclusive dating experience? I'm doing well, how are you doing?
0:22 0:22 MALE: I'm good.
0:20 0:20 FEMALE: You probably heard--
0:23 0:24 MALE: It's an interesting experience. It's fun.
0:23 0:24 FEMALE: Did you come with a friend or are you alone?
0:27 0:32 MALE: It turned out I did, but I didn't know I was. There was a bunch. I'm in the business school.
0:29 0:29 FEMALE: And they found out.
0:33 0:35 MALE: So there's a bunch. I'm okay with it.
0:33 0:33 FEMALE: I'm just teasing you.
0:36 0:41 MALE: I feel like it's something to be embarrassed about. But there's a bunch of business school kids here.
0:37 0:39 FEMALE: Okay. So are you a first year?
0:43 0:43 MALE: Second year.
0:41 0:43 FEMALE: Oh. You're the first second year I've met.  I think, yeah.
0:46 0:48 MALE: Yeah. I think so. The other guys were all first year.
0:46 0:55 FEMALE: I'm in the school of ed, so I'm doing my Masters in education in teaching.  So I'm going to be a math teacher.
1:00 1:01 MALE: Do you know nameX? Also going to be a math teacher.
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: nameX's my best friend.
1:03 1:04 MALE: Aaw, so you did come together.
1:02 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah. I coerced her into it.
1:05 1:07 MALE: Got you. It's cool.
1:05 1:12 FEMALE: We teach together. We actually teach in the same classroom everyday so I spend pretty much all my time with her.
1:15 1:17 MALE: Are you also going to Berkeley?
1:14 1:17 FEMALE: No. I'm going to teach at Saint Lorenzo High School. Do you know where that is?
1:21 1:23 MALE: No. But it's cool that you're going to teach math.
1:21 1:26 FEMALE: It is. It will be fun. St. Lorenzo has an interesting program; they do all like group work. So it's totally different than...
1:30 1:36 MALE: Interesting. That high school? This is a charter school or private school?
1:32 1:41 FEMALE: No. It's a regular, old-- it's a public school in the ghetto that happens to have a really exciting math program. It's like literally in a dump of a place.
1:41 1:42 MALE: Wow, that's pretty cool.
1:42 1:42 FEMALE: You like have to cross over the railroad tracks?
1:46 1:46 MALE: Where is it?
1:44 1:51 FEMALE: Do you know where Highway 92 splits out at 880? If you take Highway 92 over the bay, it's right there.
1:55 1:55 MALE: Where are you going to live?
1:54 1:54 FEMALE: San Francisco.
1:57 1:57 MALE: Nice.
1:55 1:57 FEMALE: It's a long drive but I think it will be okay.
2:00 2:00 MALE: I think it's worth it. I'm biased.
1:59 2:03 FEMALE: It's the California way, right, to drive an hour everyday where ever you go?  What are you doing?
2:07 2:10 MALE: I am actually probably going to stay around here. I'm trying to start a business.
2:07 2:11 FEMALE: Oh. Doing what or is that a secret?
2:12 2:32 MALE: No, it's not a secret. The details might be but preventive health care. So we're trying to create services to offer employees like nutrition, fitness, weight management, stress management, all that stuff.
2:30 2:36 FEMALE: It's a big market for that, although it's probably more like everybody is obese and they need not to be obese anymore before something goes really bad?
2:39 2:42 MALE: Actually obesity, smoking and stress kind of but--
2:39 2:40 FEMALE: Stress? There's a lot of stress.
2:46 2:48 MALE: But they're all tied into it and it relates to stress.
2:44 2:46 FEMALE: You're stressed out, you eat too much, you start to smoke.
2:50 2:54 MALE: So if we can somehow make a dent in this problem, it would be pretty fulfilling.
2:52 2:55 FEMALE: I think it'd also be very cost effective, don't you think?
2:57 3:02 MALE: Yes. Nice of you to actually recognize that. It turns out most employers don't and it's an uphill battle. 
2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Oh really?
3:03 3:10 MALE: But it's starting now, there's a lot of studies being done that if you spend the money now you save the money later.
3:08 3:15 FEMALE: Well someone who is 200 pounds overweight is going to be way more expensive than somebody who has a treadmill at their office.
3:17 3:18 MALE: Yes, exactly.
3:17 3:20 FEMALE: Also, aren't there kinds of study that indicate people are happier and more productive?
3:23 3:36 MALE: Yes. So that's another avenue that works for me; productivity and we can only make people happier and healthier. It's just hard. It sounds so fluffy so when we try to see it to a company they're like oh--
3:30 3:32 FEMALE: You're talking to somebody who wants to be a math teacher though.
3:37 3:39 MALE: Right. It's a much easier sell to you who wants to help people.
3:35 3:39 FEMALE: If I had any money at all in the positive column, I'd help you out.
3:43 3:45 MALE: Thanks. I appreciate the support. That's good to know.
3:43 3:45 FEMALE: As it is I'm $60 K in the hold to the federal government.
3:48 3:50 MALE: So you'll be teaching math for a little while. 
3:50 3:53 FEMALE: Actually the good thing about teaching is that they forgive your loans.
3:55 3:55 MALE: Wow.
3:54 3:56 FEMALE: So if I teach for five years, they'll be forgiven.
3:58 3:58 MALE: That's awesome.
3:58 4:00 FEMALE: It is awesome. That and the summers off is pretty much--
4:04 4:04 MALE: This is the government that does this?
4:02 4:07 FEMALE: Yeah. If you have a Stafford loan and Perkins loan they forgive. Bye male307, nice to meet you.
