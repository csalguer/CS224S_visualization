0:03:00.3  0:03:00.3  FEMALE:  Um, but yeah.  I'm very intrigued by that process.  I'm intrigued by the pressures women of color face when their in the humanities department and they're trying to decide between specialization interests.  There's always a stigma attached to people of color in humanities.  Oh, do your, do your peoples literature. 
0:03:07.6  0:03:07.9  MALE:  Um.

0:03:32.6  0:03:33.2  FEMALE:  And just eat something that's not good for you and like, [laughter] decorate some stupid cookies [laughter].  I mean I am so burnt out.
0:03:33.6  0:03:36.6  MALE:  Oh.  When do you get done? 
0:03:43.2  0:03:46.6  FEMALE:  In like two weeks.  And my paper's due next week.

0:04:06.1  0:04:07.9  FEMALE:  Not, not, not, not that it was outwardly, you know.
0:04:01.8  0:04:02.4  MALE:  Yeah. 
0:04:09.7  0:04:10.4  FEMALE:  You can just smell it.  It's just kind of like augh.
0:04:06.1  0:04:06.2  MALE:  Oh, that sucks. 
0:04:14.1  0:04:21.7  FEMALE:  It's [unintelligible].  I just, you know.  Or maybe it's just an 'oh, because I'm white and I can do whatever i want' thing [laughter].  I don't know.  I'm being crazy [laughter].
