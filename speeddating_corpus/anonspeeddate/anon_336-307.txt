0:00:09.3 0:00:14.4 FEMALE:  Um, I'm just like circling numbers.  Like I same like-
0:00:09.8 0:00:12.2 MALE:  Yeah, it's almost like you're not thinking about it.  
0:00:14.4 0:00:27.4 FEMALE:  -I'm stop- stopping reading this.  Um- I'm female336.

0:00:32.4 0:00:34.2 MALE:  Are you fried from all these conversations?
0:00:37.8 0:00:38.8 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
0:00:35.6 0:00:36.7 MALE:  What haven't you talked about?
0:00:41.5 0:00:44.0 FEMALE:  Um, I don't know.  We can try this [unintelligible].
0:00:39.6 0:00:42.7 MALE:  Oh, wow.  That was, uh- that was thoughtful of you to bring that.
0:00:46.7 0:00:47.1 FEMALE:  Well.
0:00:43.6 0:00:44.6 MALE:  Yeah, am I supposed to pick one?
0:00:48.5 0:00:56.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Um, do you judge others by higher or lower standards than you use to judge yourself.
0:00:52.4 0:00:55.5 MALE:  Lower.  Next question.  Definitely lower.  
0:00:58.5 0:01:01.3 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Are you pretty hard on yourself?
0:00:57.6 0:00:58.7 MALE:  Extraordinarily.
0:01:02.7 0:01:03.1 FEMALE:  Huh.
0:01:00.1 0:01:04.3 MALE:  Scarily so I would say.  Are you?  You have to answer the question too.
0:01:07.3 0:01:12.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm pretty hard on myself.  But I- I expect a lot from other people too.
0:01:11.6 0:01:13.0 MALE:  And I don't think I do actually.  [laughter] 
0:01:16.5 0:01:17.0  FEMALE:  Really?
0:01:13.0 0:01:13.7 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:01:17.3 0:01:17.5 FEMALE:  That's good.  Well- 
0:01:14.2 0:01:18.8 MALE:  I never thought about it, but I don't think I do.  See, I guess it depends on what we're talking about.
0:01:19.4 0:01:25.2 FEMALE:  It depends on what.  I depends on what.  Like- like my roommate if they're messy I don't really care, like it doesn't bother me. 
0:01:20.3 0:01:21.2 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:24.9 0:01:28.2 FEMALE:  But I may be pretty messy too, but [unintelligible].
0:01:22.8 0:01:31.8 MALE:  Yeah.  Certainly on big things like values and respect and the big things.  But I think on little things I'm much easier on other people than I am on myself.
0:01:33.5 0:01:36.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What do you study?
0:01:33.3 0:01:36.1 MALE:  I'm studying business.  What about you?
0:01:38.2 0:01:42.3 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  I think everyone I know is- [laughter] 
0:01:35.9 0:01:41.2 MALE:  I know, I know.  There's like six of us here.  It's- it's kind of an interesting-   
0:01:45.2 0:01:46.8 FEMALE:  It's crazy.  I study medicine.
0:01:42.9 0:01:44.1 MALE:  -phenomenon.  Medicine.
0:01:48.0 0:01:48.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:45.0 0:01:46.0 MALE:  At the medical school?
0:01:49.9 0:01:51.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] second year.
0:01:46.5 0:01:51.6 MALE:  It's a good place [unintelligible].  Any- oh, so you're a second year?  What are you guys doing now?
0:01:53.6 0:01:57.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  We're studying [unintelligible].
0:01:53.4 0:01:54.9 MALE:  Oh, yeah. 
0:01:57.7 0:01:59.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter].
0:01:55.2 0:02:10.2 MALE:  I have a bunch of good friends who just got through this pro- I graduated in '99, so they're now I guess doctors.  Um, but I kind of watched them go through the whole process.  It's definitely quite in- quite a process especially when you get to the whole like matching thing.  
0:02:11.5 0:02:12.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:09.9 0:02:15.0 MALE:  I remember that when they were all freaking out about where they were going to end up.  That's next year for you?
0:02:18.8 0:02:19.2 FEMALE:  Two years.
0:02:15.5 0:02:19.1 MALE:  Oh, so you have time.  Did you always know you wanted to be a doctor?
0:02:23.0 0:02:24.0 FEMALE:  No, not at all.
0:02:19.7 0:02:21.3 MALE:  Do you know now that you want to be a doctor? [laughter] 
0:02:25.0 0:02:34.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, I better know by now.  Uh, no, I just- I knew- um, I think four years after college so.
0:02:31.1 0:02:33.7 MALE:  Gotcha.  So, what were you doing in the interim?
0:02:36.9 0:02:41.5 FEMALE:  I, um, I majored in molecular biology and I- 
0:02:36.7 0:02:38.2 MALE:  That's fairly related.
0:02:42.1 0:02:44.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, but I wanted to do a PhD.
0:02:41.0 0:02:41.5 MALE:  Gotcha.
0:02:44.4 0:02:51.3 FEMALE:  So I, uh, and then I went to England to study physics and then I came back here and [unintelligible] a PhD program at Harvard.
0:02:46.3 0:02:50.4 MALE:  Wow.  So, you've been studying for a long time.
0:02:55.5 0:02:58.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, you might say I'm addicted to school or something.
0:02:54.3 0:02:56.8 MALE:  Is that true?  What you say that?
0:03:01.9 0:03:05.7 FEMALE:  I mean, just the fact that I've been in school for so many years.
0:03:00.3 0:03:00.7 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:05.6 0:03:13.9 FEMALE:  I- I- I really like being in school.  I think it's- I mean, it's a privilege to just all I have to do is study.
0:03:10.0 0:03:11.7 MALE:  Yeah, it's good to learn all the time.
0:03:15.0 0:03:16.8 FEMALE:  Yeah, but, uh- 
0:03:13.1 0:03:15.5 MALE:  Yeah, the last two years have been terrific.  I mean- 
0:03:19.4 0:03:19.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:16.0 0:03:29.6 MALE:  -'cause I was out, you know, working for the four years prior to that so it's been- you know, you really appreciate it I think when you're coming back to it after not being in that for a while.  It's like I almost forgot what it's like to work and to not be in school.  And it's been two years.
0:03:33.4 0:03:34.8 FEMALE:  Do you like school or work?
0:03:31.1 0:04:00.2 MALE:  Um, I like both for different reasons.  I've had a phenomenal two years, it's been amazing.  Um, what I did like about work was like at the end of the day you leave and you're done.  And like you- 'cause you're just free to like enjoy your evening and think about other things.  Whereas now, it's- it's like- it's just constant, it never stops.  Um, I guess it can be- I mean, I- I try to like make it that way myself you know on the weekends I'll just do my own thing, but [unintelligible].
