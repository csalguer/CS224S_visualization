0:00 0:03 FEMALE: Oh.  No, I can't do this.  I need like 30 more seconds, I'm sorry.  Sorry.
0:23 0:23 MALE: Oh, that's all right.
0:23 0:25 FEMALE: Hi.  Nice to meet you.  I'm female226.
0:25 0:26 MALE: [unintelligible].
0:26 0:27 FEMALE: Yeah, what school are you coming from?
0:28 0:30 MALE:	I'm from the [unintelligible].
0:30 0:30 FEMALE: Okay.
0:30 0:31 MALE:	[unintelligible].
0:31 0:31 FEMALE: Oh my gosh.
0:31 0:34 MALE:	Yeah, it's enjoyable.  And yourself?
0:34 0:35 FEMALE: I'm uh, MBA.
0:36 0:36 MALE: Oh [unintelligible].
0:37 0:37 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:39 0:41 MALE:	How long have you been around in the area?
0:41 0:43 FEMALE: Uh, I've been here since uh, last September.
0:44 0:44 MALE: Oh, really?
0:44 0:44 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:45 0:46 MALE: So just about a year now.
0:46 0:47 FEMALE: Yeah and I have another year to go.  How about yourself?
0:48 0:51 MALE: Ooh, I came in uh, about September of 2000 [phonetic].
0:52 0:53 FEMALE: Oh, you've been hanging around.
0:54 0:58 MALE:	I've been hanging around a while.  Just finally turned in the uh, thesis in December doing a little bit of research in the lab.
0:59 0:59 FEMALE: Right.
1:00 1:00 MALE:[unintelligible].
1:00 1:02 FEMALE: And what do -- what do you get to do when you grow up?
1:03 1:05 MALE:	Well, I don't know if I'll ever grow up.
1:05 1:05 FEMALE: [laughter].
1:05 1:07 MALE:	I'd like to build a -- I'd love to build spaceships.  You know, I was a kid growing up on a farm but I always loved space.
1:13 1:14 FEMALE: Oh my gosh.
1:14 1:15 MALE:	Yeah, a little bit strange being out in the middle of nowhere -
1:17 1:20 FEMALE: Maybe that's why right?  Because you had nothing better to occupy yourself with.
1:20 1:21 MALE:  Well, you had to have an imagination.
1:21 1:21 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:22 1:23 MALE: The nearest neighbor was about a mile or two away.
1:24 1:24 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:25 1:36 MALE:  But uh, yeah I hope uh,  I would love to work on stuff in space.  I've worked on uh, [unintelligible] projects that could have gone to space but didn't.  I'm still hoping for the first one.
1:37 1:38 FEMALE: How does it get decided?
1:38 1:40 MALE:	Uh, usually by [unintelligible].
1:40 1:40 FEMALE: Okay -
1:41 1:44 MALE:	[unintelligible].
1:45 1:52 FEMALE: Oh, but wouldn't you hope they'd sort of like budget it ahead of time so you're not wasting all your efforts and then all of a sudden -
1:52 1:58 MALE:	That's always a nice thought but uh, obviously NASA and -- and projects like that don't have MBA's such as yourself.
1:58 2:01 FEMALE: Oh, no, I don't know if I'm a good one, but I'm trying.  [laughter].
2:01 2:04 MALE:	How 'bout yourself?  I mean uh -
2:03 2:05 FEMALE: I don't get to work on spaceships unfortunately.
2:07 2:07 MALE:	I imagine not.
2:07 2:10 FEMALE: Yeah, very, very traditional stuff.  I did um -- I spent four years in New York.
2:10 2:12 MALE: Uh-mm.
2:12 2:13 FEMALE: Before coming out here so very traditional finance stuff and I'm looking to do something different for the summer.
2:18 2:18 MALE: Uh-mm.
2:19 2:23 FEMALE: Um, trying to get a job in international development.  Yeah.
2:23 2:29 MALE:	Sort of World Bankish where you're giving out monies to help developing countries build infrastructure?
2:29 2:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  Not quite World Bankish because they sort of have a bad reputation in certain circles.
2:34 2:34 MALE:	Oh, okay, well -
2:35 2:47 FEMALE: But yeah.  But ideally I'd kind of like spend um, half a summer in headquarters in Geneva or London and then half a summer developing country, actually doing grass roots stuff.  So, but it's actually proving to be more difficult then I expected so.
2:48 2:50 MALE:	[unintelligible] most good ideas usually are.
2:51 2:52 FEMALE: Yeah, [unintelligible] the money runs out [laughter].
2:53 2:53 MALE:	Absolutely.
2:55 2:55 FEMALE: [Coughing] sorry.
2:55 3:07 MALE:	Since you're a grad student I was just curious what the typical Friday, Saturday night for a  grad student MBA with international interests [unintelligible] -
3:08 3:21 FEMALE: [laughter] Uh, that's actually an excellent question.  So a typical Friday night, uh, a Saturday night, okay business [unintelligible] is extremely social so it's like this little bubble.  We don't really interact with other schools, we don't really talk with anyone else, uh, so I live in the uh -- I live in Schwab [phonetic].
3:21 3:21 MALE:	Oh, okay.
3:22 3:22 FEMALE: I don't know if you know Schwab, right?
3:23 3:25 MALE: It's just a little bit down from [unintelligible].
3:26 3:26 FEMALE: Oh.  I'm sorry?
3:27 3:29 MALE:	From the [unintelligible] or is that just a little bit further down?
3:30 3:47 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  So, like 200 of us live there.  So if somebody sends an email, uh, there's beer in the courtyard, so everybody sort of piles down and then at 4 o'clock in the morning you finally drag yourself back home and then on Saturday night you either recover, you go up to the city, depending on what else you have going on, so.  
3:48 3:48 MALE:	Really.
3:48 3:53 FEMALE: And actually, it gets to be uh -- it's extremely social.  I don't think it's -- I don't think I've ever been in an environment where it was like more social then that.
3:54 3:54 MALE:	Yeah, that's amazing.
3:54 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  [unintelligible] I mean how 'bout space building people are they [laughter].
3:58 4:04 MALE:	I don't know about most space building people, but I know about space [unintelligible] we usually go home on a -- and relax.
4:04 4:05 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:05 4:06 MALE:	Well, it was real nice talking to you -
4:05 4:07 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, male200 [phonetic], take care.
4:09 4:09 MALE:	Good to see ya.
