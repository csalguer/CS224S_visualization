0:11 0:11 FEMALE: You have one.
0:00 0:12 MALE: Yeah. But yours is sort of more high tech. I think they're discriminating. I just don't think they think that what I have to say is interesting to say. I'd like to place a formal equipment complaint. How are you doing? Nice to meet you. 
0:29 0:29 FEMALE: Hi. How are you doing?
0:13 0:17 MALE: What's going on? I was worried, was I that bad at the first meeting you had to-- I thought you left or something. 
0:35 0:38 FEMALE: I'm sorry. I really had to go.
0:19 0:21 MALE: That's okay. We're just meeting. That's okay. Are you having fun tonight?
0:41 0:41 FEMALE: I am.
0:23 0:26 MALE: This has been kind of a little interesting. This is my first speed dating experience.
0:46 0:48 FEMALE: Me, too. What do you think about it?
0:30 0:36 MALE: Hits and misses. It's definitely more than you get if you go out to a bar or something.
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: Right. At a bar you can't even talk.
0:39 0:52 MALE: It's more than you're meeting-- You're meeting at least ten or a few people. You can at least get a feel for what they seem like so I think it's kind of cool. It's definitely good at Stanford, I feel like there's not a ton of mixing between departments with the grad students so.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE: Which department are you from?
0:54 1:00 MALE: I'm in business. Even that's pretty socialable. We don't get too much outside out of our walls. How about you?
1:21 1:23 FEMALE: I actually graduated but I was in the CS department.
1:04 1:06 MALE: Okay. So you're just back for speed dating?
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: Back for speed dating.
1:08 1:10 MALE: You know someone who's running it?
1:31 1:33 FEMALE: Yeah. Actually my sister is here, too. She's over there.
1:14 1:17  MALE: That's a good deal. You said you live in the Bay area.
1:37 1:38 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. I live in Los Altos.
1:17 1:18 MALE: Where do you work in?
1:40 1:43 FEMALE: I work at this start up called Ingrian Networks. They do data security.
1:24 1:25 MALE: Data security. What Networks?
1:45 1:45 FEMALE: Ingrian.
1:27 1:27 MALE: Ingrian?
1:47 1:47 FEMALE: Ingrian. It's a small company.
1:29 1:39 MALE: Before school I covered technology stocks and a little bit of data in security. So what do they do exactly? Is it software, is it hardware?
1:57 2:04 FEMALE: It's a little bit of both. They sell to clients that encrypts your data. It goes to the database and encrypts it as it comes back.
1:44 1:45 MALE: So you write the code for the embedded software on it?
2:10 2:15 FEMALE: Yeah. I actually do the more how the user would set it up kind of thing. So more the user interface.
1:55 1:57 MALE: And are they in the city?
2:19 2:19 FEMALE: They are in Redwood city.
1:58 1:59 MALE: So do you live in the city?
2:20 2:21 FEMALE: No. I live in Los Altos actually.
2:03 2:06 MALE: I lived in the city before school. I love the city.
2:27 2:27 FEMALE: Where did you live?
2:08 2:16 MALE: I lived in Pacific Heights for a while and it was great. I'm going to be there this summer so I'm excited to kind of get back up there. But you like the peninsula better?
2:37 2:47 FEMALE: Yeah. I spent a lot of time in the city. I don't know. It's hard to-- I like going there. I can't imagine myself kind of living there just because it's a town overload.
2:28 2:31 MALE: There's too many people, you're more of like a--?
2:50 2:50 FEMALE: Yeah. It's cold.
2:32 2:32 MALE: It's cold?
2:52 2:52 FEMALE: It's cold.
2:33 2:35 MALE: It is colder than here. But you're more like a suburbs type person?
2:55 2:55 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:36 2:37 MALE: That's understandable. Where are you from?	
2:58 2:59 FEMALE: I'm from Hong Kong, actually.
2:40 2:41 MALE: Isn't that pretty crowded?
3:01 3:01 FEMALE: It's quite the city. I don't know.
2:45 2:46 MALE: I was going to say. 
3:05 3:06 FEMALE: But it's not like it's intimidating, it's just...
2:47 2:50 MALE: I was going to say, this feels like suburbs especially compared to Hong Kong.
3:07 3:07 FEMALE: Yeah. I don't know.
2:51 2:52 MALE: But you want to stay in the United States?
3:12 3:12 FEMALE: I think so.
2:55 3:09 MALE: Sorry my phone is making noise. Actually it's Snoop Dogg, Drop it Like It's Hot, it's a good ringer. Come on, get it. I have Teddy Grahams, too.
3:24 3:24 FEMALE: That's not.
3:10 3:10  MALE: What?
3:26 3:26 FEMALE: That's not bad, Well that's okay.
3:10 3:12 MALE: Stop playing I'm kind of a ringer fan. Don't you think cell phone ringers are kind of funny?
3:31 3:41 FEMALE: Yeah. I have a guy that works next to my cube. His phone goes Who Can It Be Now? the Talking Heads and it keeps saying that.
3:20 3:22 MALE: Does it play the whole song?
3:43 3:43 FEMALE: No. It just goes like that.
3:24 3:32 MALE: But is it like a polyphonic thing or is it actually a sample from the direct song?
3:47 3:52 FEMALE: Yeah. It actually sounds like somebody singing. It's very funny. Who can it be now. Yeah.
3:35 3:36 MALE: No way.
3:54 3:54 FEMALE: It's so funny.
3:38 3:41 MALE: I will have to try to find that. So it's the person's voice or it's the actual song.
4:00 4:04 FEMALE: It's the actual song. It sounds like the Talking Heads dude or whatever saying it.
3:46 3:46 MALE: Is that Talking Heads?
4:07 4:08 FEMALE: I thought it was Talking Heads, maybe I'm wrong.
3:49 3:54 MALE: I thought maybe it was like Men at Work. Who can it be now? Sorry about the loud.
4:13 4:15 FEMALE: That's okay.
3:56 3:56 MALE: It was nice to meet you.
4:16 4:16 FEMALE: Nice meeting you, too.
3:58 3:58 MALE: Have a good rest of your night.
4:19 4:19 FEMALE: Take care.
