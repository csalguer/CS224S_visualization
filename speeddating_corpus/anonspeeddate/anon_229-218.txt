0:59 1:09 MALE:   I was just thinking that [unintelligible] few weeks ago when I was taking exams and I was really thinking.  I sitting by the library over spring break and I was like -

1:36 1:50 FEMALE:  We're so -- I mean it's so intense and it's just a year.  And like everybody loves us.  So we get to take classes in a lot of different places.  So I've been hopping around between management science, and my ed school and like D school classes.  So -
1:50 1:52 MALE:   Sort of flying here and there, and every where between?
1:52 1:55 FEMALE:   Exactly, so what's your course of study?
1:56 1:58 MALE:   Um, I do Slavic [unintelligible] and literature.  And -

2:07 2:09 FEMALE:   Yeah, I've actually -
2:08 2:20 MALE:  You try to integrate in [unintelligible] language.  Try to integrate so much it's like a lot of times teachers [unintelligible] integrating it.  Just so they can sound like they're really up to date, but they really don't have no idea of what's going on.
2:20 2:21 FEMALE:   And that's what we're here for to help.
2:22 2:28 MALE:  That's what you guys are here for exactly.  Exactly, I mean like I used [unintelligible] but that's about as [unintelligible].
