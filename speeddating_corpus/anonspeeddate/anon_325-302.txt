0:00:06.4 0:00:07.2 MALE:  I'm fine, you?
0:00:07.2 0:00:08.8 FEMALE:  [laughter] I'm doing very well.
0:00:08.5 0:00:10.1 MALE:  So, uh, where are you from?
0:00:10.6 0:00:14.8 FEMALE:  I'm from- I'm from Hong Kong originally and then I'm living in Los Altos.
0:00:14.5 0:00:15.9 MALE:  Oh, you were born in Hong Kong?
0:00:16.2 0:00:17.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I was born in Hong Kong.
0:00:17.0 0:00:17.9 MALE:  Do you speak Mandarin?
0:00:18.4 0:00:19.3 FEMALE:  I speak Cantonese.
0:00:19.2 0:00:20.1 MALE:  Cantonese.  Okay.
0:00:20.1 0:00:20.5 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:20.0 0:00:21.6 MALE:  So you don't speak, uh, Mandarin-
0:00:22.3 0:00:25.6 FEMALE:  Not so much.  [laughter] I've always wanted to learn, but-
0:00:25.8 0:00:28.1 MALE:  [unintelligible] So I'm French.  
0:00:26.8 0:00:29.0 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] Uh-huh.
0:00:28.8 0:00:33.8 MALE:  And my lab in France there were two Chinese people and they were speaking to each other in English.
0:00:32.0 0:00:34.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Okay.
0:00:34.3 0:00:38.2 MALE:  -because one from- was from the south and then the other one was from Beijing.
0:00:36.7 0:00:38.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  
0:00:38.5 0:00:39.1 MALE:  So- 
0:00:39.6 0:00:43.7 FEMALE:  It's definitely kind of-  I think China is pretty divided, too.  
0:00:43.0 0:00:43.5 MALE:  Yeah.
0:00:44.3 0:00:50.4 FEMALE:  And Hong Kong for the longest time wasn't really part of China, it was more- it was a British colony.  So it's very bizarre.
0:00:47.3 0:00:53.8 MALE:  Yeah, that's right.  But for- for the French- I mean French is such a small country that it's uh-
0:00:53.1 0:00:53.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:54.1 0:00:56.0 MALE:  -we all- we all speak the same language.  
0:00:56.4 0:00:56.9 FEMALE:  Right.
0:00:55.8 0:00:59.2 MALE:  So it's very rare to imagine those people that from the same country-
0:00:58.0 0:00:58.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:59.0 0:01:00.4 MALE:  -cannot understand each other.  
0:01:00.8 0:01:01.3 FEMALE:  Right.
0:01:01.3 0:01:02.6 MALE:  So what are you doing here?
0:01:03.2 0:01:04.6 FEMALE:  Um, what am I doing here?  
0:01:04.2 0:01:04.6 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:04.4 0:01:07.3 FEMALE:  I'm, uh, uh- I'm in the CS department.
0:01:07.5 0:01:08.0 MALE:  What is that-
0:01:07.8 0:01:08.9 FEMALE:  Comput- computer Science.
0:01:08.6 0:01:10.9 MALE:  Oh.  Computer Science, okay.  So-
0:01:09.6 0:01:12.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What about you?
0:01:12.0 0:01:15.8 MALE:  Uh, the Physics department in, uh, uh, solar physics actually.
0:01:13.6 0:01:19.1 FEMALE:  Okay.  Oh that's awesome.  That's really awesome.  
0:01:19.1 0:01:25.7 MALE:  Well yeah that is very different from most of this- most of the people here are from the School of Education.  So it's kind of [unintelligible].
0:01:22.8 0:01:30.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I worked at, um, the Lockheed astrophysics lab when I was really little [unintelligible] 
0:01:28.3 0:01:33.4 MALE:  Which one, the LMA- LMSAN at, uh, Paolo Alto?  
0:01:32.5 0:01:35.9 FEMALE:  Uh, yeah, the one that's on- what is it, Hanover-
0:01:35.8 0:01:37.3 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  It's the one in Paolo Alto.
0:01:37.1 0:01:37.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:37.2 0:01:40.1 MALE:  Yeah, Lockheed Martin's, uh, Space and-
0:01:39.6 0:01:40.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  The- the-
0:01:39.8 0:01:41.2 MALE:  -I don't know what, laboratory.
0:01:41.3 0:01:45.2 FEMALE:  My- I think it was the Michelson's space telescope that was up at that time.
0:01:44.5 0:01:44.9 MALE:  The what-
0:01:45.2 0:01:46.1 FEMALE:  The Michelson-
0:01:46.0 0:01:46.7 MALE:  Michelson-	
0:01:46.6 0:01:49.1 FEMALE:  Michelson, I think.  It was a long time ago.
0:01:47.5 0:01:49.0 MALE:  Like MBI-
0:01:49.3 0:01:50.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  The MBI- 
0:01:50.0 0:01:51.7 MALE:  [unintelligible] started working on- 
0:01:51.7 0:01:53.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  That's awesome.	
0:01:51.7 0:01:56.4 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm working on [unintelligible] taking with MBI.  And so-
0:01:56.6 0:02:00.2 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I was just an intern, I was like a- I don't know what I was like-
0:02:00.2 0:02:01.3 MALE:  What were you doing there?
0:02:02.0 0:02:08.1 FEMALE:  I was just an intern.  They just gave me frames and frames of sort of the sun spot activity and I would just kind of put them together-
0:02:06.7 0:02:07.1 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:07.9 0:02:11.7 FEMALE:  -and I would write a loop to make them into a movie.  I just remember that.
0:02:09.4 0:02:18.2 MALE:  [unintelligible] your Lockheed- I- I desperately tried to, uh- to, uh, enter Lockheed Martin and they refused because I don't have a green card.
0:02:15.6 0:02:18.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:02:18.4 0:02:20.8 MALE:  -and I'm not- yeah, I'm not American so- 
0:02:21.0 0:02:28.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's too bad.  It's kind of a cool place.  It's- it's not something- it's cool because it's not something I get to do really or probably ever get to do again.
0:02:23.3 0:02:28.7 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
0:02:28.8 0:02:31.6 FEMALE:  Yeah, but- Yeah.  But, yeah.
0:02:28.5 0:02:31.6 MALE:  It's very different from what you're doing now.  [unintelligible] 
0:02:32.1 0:02:32.6 FEMALE:  But, yeah, it was cool.  
0:02:31.9 0:02:34.3 MALE:  [laughter] A small world.
0:02:32.9 0:02:39.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I still have some of those big posters of, uh, the sun and the sun spot and- yeah, it was cool.
0:02:35.3 0:02:41.9 MALE:  And so you are in Master's now or-
0:02:42.2 0:02:44.8 FEMALE:  Um, I actually graduated in 2001.
0:02:44.4 0:02:45.1 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:45.2 0:02:48.7 FEMALE:  So I'm- I'm working, actually, in the industry.
0:02:47.1 0:02:52.1 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah, it's like me.  I [unintelligible] I'm a grad student but actually I work. 
0:02:51.3 0:02:51.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:52.3 0:02:55.4 MALE:  -I already have a PhD and a- and a post doc there so. 
0:02:54.4 0:02:56.6 FEMALE:  Oh cool.  [laughter] 
0:02:57.1 0:02:58.0 MALE:  Where are you working?
0:02:58.5 0:03:05.5 FEMALE:  I'm working at a start up called Ingrian Networks.  Um, they do data security so encrypt your data, make sure people- 
0:03:01.2 0:03:05.4 MALE:  Okay.  Where- where- where is it?
0:03:05.6 0:03:06.6 FEMALE:  It's in Redwood City.
0:03:06.6 0:03:07.0 MALE:  In where?
0:03:07.3 0:03:07.9 FEMALE:  Redwood City.
0:03:07.6 0:03:09.3 MALE:  Oh red- okay.  So it's close to-
0:03:09.5 0:03:10.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It is close by.
0:03:10.6 0:03:13.9 MALE:  So you- you- you- you plan to stay here in the- in the U.S.?
0:03:14.4 0:03:19.5 FEMALE:  I think so.  I've always thought about moving to London for a little bit just because-
0:03:18.3 0:03:18.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:19.7 0:03:25.0 FEMALE:  -from being from Hong Kong- from being Hong Kong [unintelligible] British colony I have a- I have an English passport.  I have a British passport.  
0:03:24.2 0:03:26.1 MALE:  You have a British passport- Okay.
0:03:25.6 0:03:33.4 FEMALE:  So it's kind of funny to have a British passport to- and not ever have lived there.  Like I visited a bunch but like I've never lived there, so-
0:03:33.3 0:03:38.0 MALE:  Well that's- yeah, that's useful.  So you can enter the European Union with no problem. 
0:03:37.2 0:03:39.1 FEMALE:  Oh yes.  [laughter] Yeah.
0:03:38.3 0:03:40.4 MALE:  That's pretty- pretty useful. 
0:03:40.7 0:03:41.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:41.6 0:03:44.0 MALE:  But you don't plan to go back to China one day-
0:03:44.2 0:03:47.6 FEMALE:  I don't think so.  I mean it's- it's kind of a very different world now so. 
0:03:47.3 0:03:49.6 MALE:  Yeah.  I guess.
0:03:48.2 0:03:52.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, so- what France- what part of France are you from?
0:03:52.1 0:03:53.6 MALE:  Paris.  Well I- I-
0:03:53.6 0:03:54.8 FEMALE:  Oh.  Paris is so pretty.
0:03:54.6 0:03:59.6 MALE:  I worked in Paris, but I- I was not born in Paris.  Yeah, actually I don't like Paris; it's too big.  
0:03:59.5 0:04:00.3 [horn]
0:04:01.1 0:04:02.5 MALE:  Okay.  That's very short.
0:04:03.7 0:04:04.5 FEMALE:  It's really nice to meet you.
