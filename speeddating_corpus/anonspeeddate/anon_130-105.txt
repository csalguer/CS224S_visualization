0:02 0:03 MALE:  I'm getting faster.  Hi.
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  [unintelligible].  
0:06 0:08 FEMALE:  Where are you [unintelligible]?  
0:11 0:13 MALE:  I am in the chemical engineering.  What about you?  
0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  Philosophy.  
0:15 0:15 MALE:  Oh, nice.  
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Why nice?
0:19 0:21 MALE:  You are the only philosophy person I have met at this school.  
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:22 0:26 MALE:  I've met education, music, physics, lots of engineering. 
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  Music?
0:28 0:32 MALE:  I live with a music major so that kind of does it.  So.  
0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:35 0:40 MALE:  Music [unintelligible] and I'm still not sure what they do.  My, uh.
0:40 0:43 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] and play songs.  She plays the [unintelligible], or?  
0:44 0:48 MALE:  He plays--he plays a lot of things.  He plays guitar, violin.  He plays the guitar really well.  
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]?  
0:50 0:50 MALE:  Easy.  
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  I will be so [unintelligible].  
0:52 0:57 MALE:  Oh, cool.  I live in the middle of family housing with a physics major and a music major.  So...
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  I don't know where that is.
1:01 1:15 MALE:  Home?  You know when you're heading out on Fair?  That area, like family-sand that's spread out everywhere, but it's pretty cool.  They do a lot of neat stuff.  What kind of stuff do you do in your philosophy?  
1:14 1:25 FEMALE:  So, [unintelligible].  So, I want to understand how people understand themselves.  
1:26 1:26 MALE: Wow.  
1:26 1:30 FEMALE:  Who am I and stuff like that--all of the key questions.  
1:32 1:34 MALE:  Ah, those are really hard.  
1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:35 1:52 MALE:  We had a speaker present to us in a design class last quarter, and he said that the important thing that every person needed to ask themselves in order to be a good engineer was who are you and how do you want to be remembered?  Boy, that was hard.  I sat there.  
1:51 1:54 FEMALE: Why did he want you to say that?  [unintelligible].
1:55 1:56 MALE:  He said that-
1:55 1:59 FEMALE:  [interposing] [unintelligible] will know who you are for engineering.  
2:01 2:10 MALE:  He was talking more in the perspective of starting your own company and applying those values to the company that you're going to start so that you have some sense as to-
2:09 2:10 FEMALE: [interposing] So, who are you?  
2:11 2:12 MALE: I have no idea.  
2:12 2:12 FEMALE:  Obviously.  
2:16 2:22 MALE:  I think the cop out answer I came out with after that is I am me.  And that's about as--all I can say.  
2:22 2:23 FEMALE: Okay.  What does it mean?
2:24 2:34 MALE:  I have no idea.  I couldn't come up with it.  It--it kept expanding and contracting, and it just was a mess.  
2:33 2:36 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] this way?
2:38 2:42 MALE:  No, it was a good exercise, but have you come up with an answer to the question?
2:41 2:46 FEMALE: No, that's why I asked you.  That's why I say you write my thesis.
2:47 2:52 MALE: It's like--pull out the paper, okay, what's my thesis?  Yeah.  
2:52 3:07 FEMALE:  The answer is [unintelligible] I'm actually looking at psychological research.  I want to be more like more scientific about it and not just thinking that maybe some idea dropped [unintelligible].  
3:08 3:08 MALE:  Cool.  
3:08 3:22 FEMALE:  More like arguing that we have these kinds of psychological make-ups, neurobiological.  Do you know by any chance [unintelligible] any neurobiology?  
3:24 3:34 MALE:  The extent to what I know of neurobiology was that my undergrad advisor was looking at CT scans to try to detect epilepsy.  That's it.  
3:34 3:35 FEMALE:  That's [unintelligible].  
3:36 3:36 MALE: So...
3:35 3:38 FEMALE:  Do you know what [unintelligible]?  Do you ever [unintelligible]?  
3:39 3:39 MALE:  No. 
3:39 4:04 FEMALE:  So, there are these clues to [unintelligible] people who have some damage in their brain.  Like, for instance, they--somebody [unintelligible] her leg is not her leg.  What I want to understand how--the responsing in our brain [unintelligible] actually make [unintelligible] to be ours.  
4:06 4:19 MALE:  There's a lot of really cool stuff.  What I do is controls particularly like human and robotic interactions.  But I ran out of time.  I was--thank you.  And what number was it?
