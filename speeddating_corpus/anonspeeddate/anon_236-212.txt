0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  Yeah it's fun.  

0:16 0:22 MALE:  I've never done it before, it's kind of stressful, you know, you only have like your four minutes and then move on down.  

0:43 0:46 FEMALE:  But I'm not moving, I haven't been moving so I feel [laughter].  

0:25 0:28 MALE:  Yeah that is the thing, you sort of sit here and you have your own little area.  

0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

0:30 0:34 MALE:  Your water, your end table.  You're like a nice little [unintelligible].  

0:53 1:00 FEMALE:  [laughter] so yeah and -- but [unintelligible] supposed to fill out the chart.  

0:41 0:41 MALE:  Yeah.  

1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  Because every time I'm kind of slow, so --  

0:44 0:44 MALE:  It's not a problem.  

1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  Um, so --  

0:47 0:55 MALE:   When you're in doubt -- yeah so tell me about yourself, like what program are you in and like what's your graduate -- like what are you studying?  

1:17 1:19 FEMALE:  I study education.  

1:00 1:00 MALE:  Okay cool.  

1:20 1:23 FEMALE:  And uh testing, like management.  

1:04 1:09 MALE:  Oh okay, so you like -- educational testing like SAT stuff or like --  

1:29 1:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah stuff like that.  But I'm only like, but I really don't know how to do it now because I'm only second year in the program.  

1:20 1:20  MALE:  Oh I see.  

1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  So I still don't --  

1:21 1:25 MALE:  So you're still taking the tests in class, you haven't got any time of your own.  

1:44 1:55 FEMALE:  [laughter] like when you said like SAT I said, well it's just, well it's supposed what I want to do, but it still looks so [unintelligible] [laughter].  

1:37 1:37 MALE:  Cool, yeah.  

1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  How about you?  

1:38 1:40 MALE:  I'm in management science and engineering.  

2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  Oh cool.  

1:41 1:50 MALE:  It's, it's okay.  I do like a lot more management than I do engineering, but it keeps me busy and I'm going to graduate this year with my sort of first and only year.  

2:10 2:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

1:51 2:10 MALE:  It's going to be nice.  Yeah I actually thought about taking an education class this semester, like the introduction to the politics of education or something like that.  It seemed pretty cool, but then I went to like the book stores and the course reader is like you know really huge and I was like, I like education, but maybe not enough to read all this.  

2:29 2:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I feel like engineering is so hard because it like requires lots of math.  

2:16 2:17 MALE:  Yeah.  

2:37 2:39 FEMALE:  And I'm really not very good.  

2:19 2:24 MALE:  Yeah me neither actually.  My program hasn't required a lot of math, I'm very happy about that.  

2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  Really.  

2:25 2:31 MALE:  Now have you been taking courses that are math intensive or you can be like me and take psychology and organizational behavioral courses.  

2:50 2:51 FEMALE:  Oh okay.  

2:32 2:35 MALE:  I even applied a course in like drama toward [unintelligible], so --  

2:55 3:07 FEMALE:  That's cool.  I'm taking probably like -- I'm kind of sometimes go to a group and they do some drama things as well, so I think it's fun.  

2:48 2:53 MALE:  So like is it a career, do you see yourself in like educational policy or like teaching or --  

3:14 3:27 FEMALE:  Teaching, like probably, hopefully I can teach -- yeah I really like teaching because I feel like it keeps me out to be with kids all the time.  So -- 

3:08 3:12 MALE:  So you're more of like an elementary, like a younger kids or --  

3:32 3:49 FEMALE:  Well, hopefully I can be like the -- in academia you know, but I still like don't know how it will eventually work out.  But I haven't really thought that far yet.  How about you, are you going to work?  

3:30 3:35 MALE:  I think initially at least.  I'd like to work for like either for like the Walt Disney company or like a consulting firm or something like that.  

3:56 3:56 FEMALE:  Wow.  Disney is cool.  

3:37 3:46 MALE:  We'll see how it goes.  Yeah that's my dream.  I haven't been successful yet.  But at any rate it's been a pleasure meeting you and I guess, enjoy the rest of your evening.  

4:06 4:06 FEMALE: You too.
