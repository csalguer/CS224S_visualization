1:42 1:50 MALE:  You know it's going to be hard.  Like not [unintelligible] expect this of you, but I was talking to someone else.  And they started talking about the [unintelligible] moot court or something.  
1:49 1:51 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, we all had to do that.  
1:51 1:53 MALE:  You had to breath.  It sound like--
1:53 2:01 FEMALE:  [interposing]  It's neat though because [unintelligible] this is so much work, but it really should be portrayed.  And then you would do a better job [unintelligible].  But you'd be doing it for a grade.  So...
2:02 2:05 MALE:  A lot of people like they work very hard, but they never sort of got like--
2:05 2:12 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Right, so it's annoying, but then you like you don't put in the effort that you know you should.  But yet you still [unintelligible].
