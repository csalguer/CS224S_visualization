00:01  	00:01  	MALE:  [horn]

00:01  	00:03  	FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female126.

00:03  	00:05  	MALE:  I'm male104.  What's going on?

00:05  	00:09  	FEMALE:  Not -- nothing so much as far as [unintelligible], you know

00:10  	00:10  	MALE:  That sounds like fun.

00:12  	00:13  	FEMALE:  I know yeah.  So where did you grow up?

00:13  	00:15  	MALE:  I grew up in New York but I moved to Florida when I was young.

00:16  	00:16  	FEMALE:  Where in New York?

00:17  	00:18  	MALE:  Long Island.

00:18  	00:20  	FEMALE:  I grew up in near Poughkeepsie.

00:21  	00:32  	MALE:  You know where Croton-Harmon is?  It's on near Poughkeepsie is on the end of the train line and it goes to like Croton-Harmon and then it goes to a bunch of other places.

00:33  	00:33  	FEMALE:  Ah.

00:34  	00:35  	MALE:  And um, --

00:35  	00:36  	FEMALE:   I wasn't allowed on the train when I was -- [laughter].  

00:37  	00:37  	MALE:  Ah-huh.

00:38  	00:39  	FEMALE:  Because even in --

00:40  	00:41	MALE:  I could see it was like a really dangerous place

00:42  	00:54  	FEMALE:  Yeah, so my brother was at WestPoint -- well, we moved -- we also moved to California and my bother went to WestPoint [unintelligible], Virginia, but it --

00:54  	00:55  	MALE:  You moved to California before were here?

00:55  	01:04  	FEMALE:  When I was in high school.  I was born and raised near Poughkeepsie and then moved here in high school.  And um, we both left to because we hated California, so much.  So we really --

01:00  	01:05  	MALE:  Ah-huh, so that's why you came back here?

01:06  	01:20  	FEMALE:  It was purely an academic decision.  I came to San Francisco and heard it was a great school.  The only downside to Stanford before I got here was the fact that it was in California.  My friends all hold that against me too much, unfortunately they found a couple of other things.

01:20  	01:27  	MALE:  Yeah, the only reason I came here is because it's in California.  I don't like Stanford at all.  I just really -- I've been trying to come to California for years. 

01:27  	01:27  	FEMALE:  Where did you go to undergrad?

01:27  	01:33  	MALE:  University of Florida.  So you could see why I would want to leave there.

01:33  	01:41  	FEMALE:  [laughter] how close did you live -- when did you -- when you said you moved to Florida, did you mean you moved before college or?

01:42  	01:47  	MALE:  No, no, I moved when I was like seven or whatever.  I really wanted to like -- but whatever.

01:47  	01:59  	FEMALE:  Yeah, in college I went to go visit my brother in at WestPoint and I was going to take the train to Poughkeepsie, my mother -- I was like 20 something years old, my mother would not let me go.  

01:59  	01:59  	MALE:   You weren't allowed to drive it?

01:59  	02:01  	FEMALE:  I couldn't go there after dusk, not even dark, after dusk a male had to pick me up.  My brother's girlfriend was 26 at the time, no; she could not pick me up

02:01  	02:01  	MALE:  Not good enough, huh?

02:01  	02:26  	FEMALE:  I had to have a male pick me up during the day and I could not be in that train all night, you know.  I'd say mom you're making my travel plans so hard, I don't care you're not going to use the train.  So unfortunately I don't have a lot of experience with the train.  Any time I went down to the city we drove in a car.

02:27  	02:31  	MALE:  I wouldn't want to drive it sounds like more dangerous to take a car in the city. 

02:31  	02:40  	FEMALE:  Well, we would usually take it to the edge of the city.

02:40	02:40	MALE:  Like to a train station?  Oh.

02:40	02:42	FEMALE:  And bounce around, but we wouldn't be driving once we got into the city.

02:43  	02:49  	MALE:  My experience in New York is hop on the train and I'd ride back and forth a while and then when the week was over I would go home.

02:50  	02:52  	FEMALE:  [laughter] did you have fun time on the plane?

02:53  	02:56  	MALE:  Yeah I really did, I really liked it.  I'd ride the train every morning and every night.

02:57  	03:01  	FEMALE:  But out of enjoyment not -- working? 

03:01  	03:08  	MALE:  No, yeah, it's out of like getting places, but no, the train's pretty fun, just like [unintelligible], not that --

03:09  	03:09  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

03:10  	03:15  	MALE:  So are you going to get the hell out of California after you get your Stanford degree or are you being converted?

03:16  	03:33  	FEMALE:  Well, I wouldn't say I'm being converted.  What's changing my mind is that my family is here.  And -- you know for a while it will be fun to be somewhere else, but --

03:33  	03:34  	MALE:  So why don't you like it here?

03:34  	03:35  	FEMALE: Why don't I?

03:35  	03:36  	MALE:  Too much pollution?  Too many people?

03:36  	03:45  	FEMALE:  Well, I mean -- it's so -- first of all it's so built up, I mean grew up south of Pough --  like I was born in Poughkeepsie, but we lived in [unintelligible] Falls, you probably never heard of it, because it's so tiny. 

03:46  	03:47  	MALE:  Sounds like a good place though.

03:47  	04:03  	FEMALE:  the thing is it was -- I mean it was more rural part than suburbs, I mean it wasn't really farm -- there were farms around.  I think it was only an hour from a big city you have the benefit, so you can go to the city and experience all that stuff.  You were far enough away but you're not in the city.  And this is so urban, so busy.

04:02  	04:06  	MALE:  Yeah. Yeah, I hear that.  I can hear that.

04:06  	04:07	FEMALE:  God.  

04:08	04:09	MALE:  See ya.

04:09  	04:09  	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.

04:10  	04:10  	MALE:  You too.
