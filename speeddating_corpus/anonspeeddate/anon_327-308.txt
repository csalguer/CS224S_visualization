0:03 0:07 MALE: [laughter] Please just take a moment.  It's high pressure.  I had no idea.
0:12 0:13 FEMALE: I know, seriously.
0:08 0:8 MALE: So
0:14 0:14 FEMALE: I'm female327, again.
0:09 0:09 MALE: female327?
0:15 0:15 FEMALE: Yes.
0:10 0:10 MALE: male308.  Good to meet you again.
0:16 0:16 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, male308.
0:11 0:12 MALE: So what do you study?
0:17 0:19 FEMALE: I am here in the school of education.
0:14 0:14 MALE: Excellent.
0:19 0:22 FEMALE: I study early childhood development and psychology and
0:17 0:18 MALE: Master's or PhD?
0:24 0:27 FEMALE: I'm a PhD student.  I'm in my fourth year now.  [unintelligible].
0:22 0:25 MALE: [unintelligible].  I've just been meeting education master's students.  Lazy.
0:30 0:31 FEMALE: And here I am.
0:26 0:29 MALE: Only want to do one or two year program.  Good for you.
0:35 0:36 FEMALE: I'm sticking around for the long haul, you know.
0:31 0:32 MALE: I won't ask how long.  
0:37 0:37 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:33 0:35 MALE: What comes next?  Are you interested in academia or
0:40 0:44 FEMALE: Um, well somewhat.  But I think that I'm going to wait for that for a while
0:40 0:40 MALE: That's very smart.
0:45 0:49 FEMALE: --because I think I'd like to just stay in research for a bit.  So.  Yeah.
0:44 0:44 MALE: That's really cool.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE: How about you?  What do you do here?
0:45 0:49 MALE: So I'm a second year law student.  I just finished up. We had finals yesterday.  So--
0:54 0:55 FEMALE: Oh congratulations.
0:50 0:53 MALE: Thank you.  I will take it.  It's been a grueling week. 
0:58 0:58 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:54 0:55 MALE: Um, but, uh, but see, you're smart.  I, you know, every week it's sort of tweaking what happens after this.
1:05 1:06 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
1:01 1:03 MALE: But I love it.  I find it really interesting.
1:08 1:12 FEMALE: Cool.  So what do you hope to do after this experience?
1:07 1:09 MALE: Work at a firm for a few years.
1:14 1:14 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:09 1:11 MALE: But I'm really interested in criminal prosecution.
1:17 1:17 FEMALE: Okay.
1:12 1:16 MALE: And would love, uh, political climate, being in line-
1:21 1:21 FEMALE: Yeah?
1:16 1:17 MALE: --to be a judge one day
1:22 1:22 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:17 1:18 MALE: --down the road a long ways.
1:23 1:23 FEMALE: Wow.
1:19 1:20 MALE: It's, uh, see--
1:25 1:29 FEMALE: So ambitious [laughter].  No, I'm just teasing.
1:24 1:28 MALE: Well you know, listen we've can't all be PhD students, we have to compensate somehow [laughter].
1:33 1:33 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:29 1:32 MALE: Uh, what were you doing before this?  Did you just come straight through or were you working for a bit?
1:37 1:43 FEMALE: Um, no, actually, after I did my undergraduate degree, I did some policy work in D.C. for a year.
1:39 1:39 MALE: What were you doing?
1:44 1:51 FEMALE: Um, I did also work in the [unintelligible] funding administration, um, around early childhood education type of issues, so.
1:41 1:42 MALE: Sounds sweet.  So you knew all along?
1:52 2:04 FEMALE: So it was fun.  Yeah.  I mean, I can't really say I knew all along.  I kind of studied early childhood development, and it was more like social psychology when I was an undergrad.  And so, um, I worked in D.C. for a year like
1:59 2:00 MALE: How did you enjoy it?  Was it cool?
2:05 2:06 FEMALE: Oh I loved it.
2:01 2:01 MALE: Yeah.
2:06 2:08 FEMALE: It was really fantastic experience.
2:03 2:06 MALE: 'Cause you hear so many conflicting things about D.C., where you know, everybody's talking about
2:11 2:11 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:08 2:10 MALE: --shop all the time.  But it's an interesting shop, right?
2:15 2:21 FEMALE: [unintelligible] you see.  It's intense to be there, but I think it's also kind of good to be around that kind of energy for, you know, 
2:17 2:18 MALE: Oh definitely.  People who are that passionate about-- 
2:22 2:23 FEMALE: [unintelligible].
2:18 2:18 MALE: --what they're doing.
2:24 2:24 FEMALE: Exactly.  Exactly. 
2:20 2:23 MALE: And thenthen you came into grad school?  Or
2:28 2:37 FEMALE: Um, I did some graduate work in, um, Boston for a bit.  And then, I did some graduate work in Manhattan for a bit.  And then I came here to really finally wrap up
2:32 2:35 MALE: You certainly did one of these slow mature curves around--
2:38 2:38 FEMALE: --the graduate work.
2:37 2:40 MALE: Which have you liked the most so far.  I mean, you can't really say you enjoy Palo Alto the most out of the three.
2:46 2:57 FEMALE: You know, I can't say Palo Alto, per say, but I think kind of the Bay area in general, kind of the energy here is probably more kind of my speed.  I mean, my heart is in New York.  I grew up in New York.
2:52 2:53 MALE: Oh where in--
2:58 3:01 FEMALE:  You know, I grew up in Long Island, actually.  But, um
2:56 2:57 MALE: That's nice.  Not too far from the city.
3:02 3:03 FEMALE: Yeah.  Exactly.
2:58 2:58 MALE: I [unintelligible].
3:03 3:15 FEMALE: Yeah.  So I really enjoyed it out there.  But you know, it's kind of like, particularly after 9/11 and stuff like that, it's been kind ofthe energy here has been good, I think.  I mean, Boston
3:11 3:12 MALE: You feel like New York's the same--
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: --city and
3:13 3:17 MALE: --at this point, I mean?  Or is it still kind of, uh, a little change in
3:22 3:28 FEMALE: It's getting back.  I think it's getting back to, you know, kind of how it used to be.  But I think, you know, when something like that happens, obviously
3:23 3:25 MALE: It's going to take a while.  
3:29 3:30 FEMALE: --it just kind of stays, and people
3:25 3:25 MALE: Yeah.  For sure.
3:31 3:34 FEMALE: --[unintelligible].  Yeah.  So how about you?  Where did you grow up?
3:29 3:31 MALE: Well I grew up in Tennessee.  Uh
3:36 3:36 FEMALE: Really?
3:32 3:35 MALE: And then I discovered California in college, and I thought, oh there's a better places--
3:40 3:40 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].
3:36 3:37 MALE: --than Tennessee out there.  Uh so I was up in Seattle for two years, working for Microsoft.  And then, uh, I came back, and--
3:48 3:49 FEMALE: What made you decide to get into law school?
3:45 3:50 MALE: Um, well I was having this experience where, you know, a person offered me the job.
3:56 3:56 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:51 3:53 MALE: You're working really hard, and you don't know really what you're doing.
3:59 3:59 FEMALE: Oh yeah.
3:50 3:59 MALE: And so I was bringing all this work home and turning onI'll try to make it a short story.
4:04 4:05 FEMALE: Well sure.
4:00 4:01 MALE: Do you know Bravo Network?
4:07 4:07 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
4:02 4:04 MALE: They have a show on there, Inside the Actor's Studio.
4:10 4:12 FEMALE: Oh I love that show.  
4:06 4:08 MALE: You know what I'm talking about?
4:12 4:13 FEMALE: It's fantastic.
4:08 4:13 MALE: Well before college, I always thought that I'd want to work in the business side of the entertainment industry.
4:18 4:18 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:13 4:13 MALE: So here I am.  I don't know anybody in Seattle.
4:20 4:20 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:15 4:17 MALE: I'm working really hard, not really sure if it's for me. 
4:22 4:22 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:18 4:19 MALE: I'll make this really short.
4:25 4:26 FEMALE: Sure, sure.
4:22 4:23 MALE: I thought, maybe I want to get back into the entertainment industry.
4:28 4:28 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:24 4:26 MALE: I thought, well law school could be sort of a jumping off period.
4:31 4:31 FEMALE: Sure.
4:28 4:30 MALE: Somehow when I ended up here, I was interested in [unintelligible]--
4:34 4:34 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:30 4:31 MALE: --than the law, but that's life for you, so.
4:37 4:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  True, true.
4:33 4:34 MALE: Anyway, it was really good to talk to you.
4:39 4:41 FEMALE: It was really meeting you, too.  Yeah.
