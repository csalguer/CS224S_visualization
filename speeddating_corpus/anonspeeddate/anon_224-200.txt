0:15 0:16 MALE:  Oh yeah.  
0:17 0:20 FEMALE:  Uh, they say keep it at your shoulder, I hope this is the right place.  I'm not really sure.  
0:21 0:21 MALE:  [unintelligible]

0:24 0:24 MALE:  Good, yourself? 
0:25 0:25 FEMALE:  I'm very good. 
0:26 0:26 MALE:  Very nice.  
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  The four minutes is a lot shorter then I thought it was.  
0:28 0:29 MALE:  It really is.  [unintelligible] 
0:29 0:33 FEMALE:  You're like--[laughter] and people are in the middle of stories. They should give you like a clock so you know.  
0:34 0:34 MALE:  Like a counter. 
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  Like when you're on TV.  So--
0:36 0:36 MALE:  Yeah.    
0:37 0:39 FEMALE:  --you have like the 10 second warning or something.  So you can wrap things up.  
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Or at least the music from Jeopardy [unintelligible] 
0:42 0:44 FEMALE:  [laughter] Exactly.  
0:45 0:48 MALE:  Uh, so um, do you like [unintelligible] 
0:49 0:52 FEMALE:  Oh I'm just curious, like, what program you're in, et cetera, et cetera.  
0:53 0:53 MALE:  I'm an engineer.  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
0:54 0:54 MALE:  Uh, aeronautics and astronautics. 
0:55 0:57 FEMALE:  Everybody I've met so far has been an engineer.  [laughter] 
0:58 1:02 MALE:  Well that's not a big surprise, there's only about, I don't know, one gal per 10 or 20 guys. 
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  Right. No, I'm sure.  
1:05 1:08 MALE:  [unintelligible]  
1:09 1:09 FEMALE:  You what? 
1:09 1:09 MALE:  In space. 
1:10 1:10 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:11 1:14 MALE:  Space craft, all kinds of stuff like that, and grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.  
1:15 1:20 FEMALE:  Well it's going to be even better for you now that all these um, like private companies are taking space ships out and stuff. 
1:21 1:21 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  That's great. 
1:22 1:26 MALE:  That was interesting when [unintelligible] came out and gave a talk.  And [unintelligible] 
1:27 1:30 FEMALE:  No, but the air you gave away, did they give away the X-Prize?   
1:31 1:35 MALE:  They have given away the X-Prize, and I'm actually surprised that you actually uh, knew about the X-Prize.  
1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:36 1:39 MALE:  Well I guess it was on the news, five years ago, I really would have been surprised. 
1:40 1:43 FEMALE:  Right, right, right. No five years ago, I agree, but they, they put it on the Daily Show. 
1:44 1:44 MALE:  [unintelligible] nameX nameX.  
1:45 1:50 FEMALE:  I think it was--He is a good guy.  I think it was actually uh, Moment of Zen in fact. 
1:51 1:53 MALE:  Ah yeah, I, I do enjoy Moments of Zen as few as they are. 
1:54 1:56 FEMALE:  [laughter] There's one for every episode.  [laughter] 
1:57 1:57 MALE:  [unintelligible]  
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  I'm uh, in the MBA program. 
2:00 2:00 MALE:  [unintelligible]  
2:01 2:01 FEMALE: MBA program. 
2:01 2:01 MALE:  Oh yeah.  
2:02 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, so it's a great program, it's a lot of fun.  
2:05 2:05 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
2:06 2:08 FEMALE:  But I think the odds are a little better for us on male/female. 
2:09 2:11 MALE:  Yeah, I've often said many times [unintelligible] business--
2:12 2:12 FEMALE:  [laughter]
2:12 2:15 MALE:  [unintelligible]  
2:16 2:18 FEMALE:  Well business is still, I mean it's still a two-thirds, one-third. 
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Really?  
2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  It's not equal, but um--
2:20 2:21 MALE:  I'm surprised. 
2:22 2:31 FEMALE:  Yeah, but as long as you're not in, in the finance classes, I think it's very noticeable.  But in all the other classes it's, it's generally pretty half and half.  So it's not too bad.  Yeah 
2:32 2:37 MALE:  That's good, I'm a strong believer in encouraging women into engineering, it's just my uh--
2:38 2:38 FEMALE: My best friend is an engineer though. 
2:39 2:39 MALE:  Really? 
2:40 2:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, she--well my best friend in the program.  She worked for GM.  
2:44 2:44 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:44 2:51 FEMALE:  She, uh, they called her the Piston Princess because she's, her specialty was pistons, so yeah. 
2:52 2:55 MALE:  Well, you know, you do kind of have to enjoy a good piston [unintelligible] 
2:56 2:57 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And they do when she makes them so.  
2:58 3:08 MALE:  [unintelligible] so since you are a grad student, what's a typical grad student's uh, Saturday night for an MBA?  
3:09 3:28 FEMALE:  [laughter] Um, probably one of the--I don't know, like there's usually some party going on, either in the city or here on campus.  Um, or I'm usually, a lot of times I'm on some trip, so for example, not this past weekend but the weekend before, I was at Jazz Fest, which was a lot of fun.  Um--what? 
3:29 3:29 MALE:  Where was that? 
3:30 3:37 FEMALE:  It's in New Orleans.  Every year they do Jazz Fest, it's like two weeks, it's a big, huge music festival where they have great creole food available--
3:38 3:38 MALE:  [unintelligible]  
3:39 3:45 FEMALE:  --it's a lot of fun.  And then this weekend, my mom's coming to visit, so it'll be a very different Saturday night.  
3:46 3:46 MALE:  [unintelligible]  
3:47 3:49 FEMALE:  But we're going to go to Napa, so that should be fun.  
3:50 3:51 MALE:  [unintelligible] Have you ever been to the Hillside [unintelligible]. 
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Because you know, I've never--
3:53 3:53 FEMALE:  You've never been?  
3:54 3:54 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  How many years have you been here?  
3:56 3:56 MALE:  I've been here for five years. 
3:57 4:02 FEMALE:  [laughter] Oh, that doesn't bode well.  [laughter] 
           [horn]
4:03 4:06 MALE:  I definitely think that [unintelligible] 
4:07 4:07 FEMALE:  [laughter] It was very nice to meet you. 
4:07 4:11 MALE:  You too.
