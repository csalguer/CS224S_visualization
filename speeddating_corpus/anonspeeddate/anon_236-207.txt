0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  I'm a second year.  

0:35 0:37 MALE:  Oh yeah?  I'm in electrical engineering.  

0:27 0:27 FEMALE:  Oh.  

0:38 0:39 MALE:  PhD also.  

0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  wow.  

0:39 0:39 MALE:  Third year.  

0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  Oh okay.

0:55 0:58 MALE:  Five total, I still have two more or three more, two more or three more.  

0:48 0:55 FEMALE:  Okay.  So, because that's usually the time like people do it here, do their program here?  

1:06 1:16 MALE:  Yeah, I mean it really varies and I mean as you probably know it varies a lot, but electrical engineers don't generally get out in less than five years total.  

1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Oh.  

1:18 1:26 MALE:  And then sometimes, I mean, I was with my advisor for a year and then switched, so that like kind of cost me some time, so that's why it might be six for me.  

1:17 1:30 FEMALE:  Oh.  Yeah I know that engineering um, is um like the Stanford [unintelligible] what Stanford famous for, so I do like it must be much, very challenging you know.  

1:42 1:48 MALE:  It's pretty tough.  There's a lot of -- they take a lot of students and then like it's pretty competitive to find a lab to work in.  

1:38 1:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah I heard about that.  Like they all complain about the qualification exam, like they say it's too hard, like they really like weed out people and it's really horrible.  

2:00 2:10 MALE:  They take -- yeah so for our [unintelligible] they pass about 30% per year.  You get to take it twice, so, but still I mean that's still a pretty small fraction I guess.  

2:01 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, so you must be very good.  Like, because like one of my friends she failed and she was really sad about that.  

2:19 2:19 MALE:  Just once?  

2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

2:21 2:22 MALE:  She's electrical?  

2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

2:23 2:24 MALE:  So she'll get another shot right?  

2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, but she's so worried you know.  

2:27 2:28 MALE: I mean it does suck.  

2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

2:30 2:41 MALE:  It's annoying.  But I don't know, I think like if you study hard enough you can often get through it.  But it is, it's just -- I mean it's incredibly stressful.  It's easy for me to say that being passed it right?    

2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

2:41 2:42 MALE:  So --  

2:33 2:42 FEMALE:  I mean because like you're so smart, you don't even like know how hard it is to others [laughter].  I just feel like very sorry for her you know.
