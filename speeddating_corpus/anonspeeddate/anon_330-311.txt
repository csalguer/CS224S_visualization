00:01 00:02 FEMALE: They haven't told us to start yet.  
00:06 00:07 MALE: Okay.  You're hiding it there.  
00:09 00:09 FEMALE: I know.  
00:08 00:10 MALE: Very tricky.  Sincerity, no.  
00:13 00:16 FEMALE: No.  They have to actually make an effort to earn to learn my name.  
00:16 00:17 MALE: That's true.  That's a good idea.  
00:19 00:20 FEMALE: See.  There it is.  
00:19 00:19 MALE: There you go.  
00:21 00:23 FEMALE: That's the sign.  Anyways.  
00:23 00:24 MALE: So, what do you study here?  
00:25 00:28 FEMALE: Um, I'm in a program called IPER--
00:28 00:28 MALE: Hybrid?  
00:29 00:30 FEMALE: IPER.  
00:30 00:30 MALE: Hyper?  
00:32 00:32 FEMALE: Yeah.  No, IPER.  
00:32 00:32 MALE: IPER?
00:34 00:34 FEMALE: Yeah.  
00:33 00:34 MALE: I-P-E-R?  
00:35 00:35 FEMALE: Yeah. 
00:35 00:38 MALE: Okay.  What--that must stand for something because I've never heard of IPER.  
00:39 00:43 FEMALE: Yeah, it's, um, Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.  
00:43 00:43 MALE: Oh, okay.  
00:44 00:52 FEMALE: So, when--you know when programs have really big names it means that it's very vague, which means that you can do whatever you want.  
00:52 00:56 MALE: So what's your specialty within this?  Let me just turn this--sorry.  
00:57 00:58 FEMALE: Oh, courteous, hmm.  
00:58 01:03 MALE: Yeah.  No, see courteous, I turned it off.  I didn't answer it.  [unintelligible]  So what do you--
01:03 01:07 FEMALE: It's good that you try to rationalize why you should have a high score in something.  
01:08 01:11 MALE: So what--what is, uh, what's your focus, then, within this program?  
01:13 01:23 FEMALE: Uh, I'm studying social entrepreneurship.  I'm in water [unintelligible] so how you can apply entrepreneurship to solve the water problem in the world, like clean water in developing countries.  
01:23 01:25 MALE: Wow.  That's actually huge.  
01:26 01:26 FEMALE: How about you?  
01:26 01:31 MALE: Um, I'm, uh, I did an MBA and now I'm doing a, uh, class for electrical engineering.  
01:32 01:32 FEMALE: Okay.  
01:32 01:34 MALE: And I work for part-time.  So...
01:35 01:35 FEMALE: Oh, that's interesting.  
01:36 01:36 MALE: Yeah.  
01:36 01:39 FEMALE: Usually people get the engineering degree before it.  
01:39 01:41 MALE: Yeah, I'm, like, messed up.  So...
01:42 01:42 FEMALE: Good to know.  [laughter]
01:43 01:45 MALE: Yeah, now you're like, you met--he's a foolish person.  
01:48 01:48 FEMALE: He's ambitious.  
01:48 02:30 MALE: Ambitious, yes.  Pretty, like, [unintelligible].  But, no, I, uh, you know, I, uh, I always wanted to do an engineering degree but during undergraduate I just didn't have the sort of--it wasn't the right sort of time to do it.  Now, I figure that, you know, I'm working part-time, really understanding that to be able to communicate to the engineering group that you work with is super important.  And just--I don't like it when people are very insincere about, you know, knowing the technology, like, they pretend to know what people are talking about.  They beat around the bush.  And I just don't like the smoke and mirrors so I think that it's important to really say I'm going to take the time to understand what you're trying to do because that's important.  
02:31 02:32 FEMALE: No, that's great.
02:32 02:37 MALE: Sincere time.   [laughter]  So that, uh, no, I actually do believe that.  
02:36 02:39 FEMALE: No, it's good that you're giving me all the answers.  I can't think about that, so...
02:40 02:49 MALE: But I actually think it is important to know so you connect with people you work with because I think so many times people don't take the time to really do that.  
02:49 02:53 FEMALE: No, that is true and actually that's part of the philosophy of my program, that--
02:53 02:53 MALE: Oh, really?   
02:54 02:55 FEMALE: Engineers--
02:54 02:55 MALE: Because it's interdisciplinary?  
02:56 03:09 FEMALE: Yeah, exactly.  Like engineers don't understand business people, business people don't understand law, uh, you know, people--and it's a mess so we're trying to make some students learn a little bit of everything.  
03:10 03:10 MALE: Yeah.  
03:10 03:12 FEMALE: So we don't have that much gap [unintelligible].  
03:13 03:16 MALE: Yeah.  Well, knowing a little bit of everything goes a long way.  
03:16 03:17 FEMALE: You think so?  
03:17 03:24 MALE: Yeah, well, really.  Totally.  Because, you know, it allows you to be--you're like the, the straw the stirs the drink.  You make things happen, you know.  
03:25 03:28 FEMALE: Well, I'm going to call you when I get my crisis and I'm, like, I don't know anything.  
03:29 03:33 MALE: But you see, you'll know how to communicate to the people who are experts.  
03:33 03:33 FEMALE: That's true.  
03:34 03:35 MALE: So...which is important.  
03:34 03:47 FEMALE: But it's tough still.  I mean, it's good what you're doing, which is not just, you know, touching the surface and learning the lingo and understanding the basics but you're really trying to understand and empathize with people you're working with.  
03:48 03:58 MALE: Yeah, because, you know, how many times do you sit around the water cooler saying, you know, my boss doesn't understand anything that I've said, or why is this important?  
03:58 03:59 FEMALE: I say that of all my advisors.  
04:00 04:01 MALE: Oh, really?  That's scary, no.  
04:02 04:19 FEMALE: Well, it is because I--I'm studying or drawing from three or four disciplines for my thesis so if I go to my anthropology advisor, she's not going to understand anything about my engineering issues and vice versa.  So it's actually pretty tough.  
04:19 04:21 MALE: So you must have, like, three or four advisors then?  
04:21 04:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  
04:23 04:25 MALE: Do you ever get together and have, like, lunch?  
04:25 04:29 FEMALE: We do.  I mean, the program really stimulates this type of interaction.  
04:29 04:30 MALE: Oh, okay.  
04:29 04:42 FEMALE: But you know when you're really trained at something you don't truly change.  It's really hard to understand each other's methods and they have their biases, I mean, that's why they chose their discipline in the first place.  
04:43 04:43 MALE: Yeah, that's true.  
04:43 04:46 FEMALE: So making a physicist take social sciences seriously--
04:47 04:48 MALE: Yeah, forget it.  It's not going to happen.  
04:48 04:50 FEMALE: Not going to happen.  What did he say?  
04:51 04:52 MALE: I have no idea.  
04:52 04:53 FEMALE: Oh, I think we're--
04:55 04:55 MALE: Is this the end?  
04:55 05:03 FEMALE: I think so.  Is this your first time doing this?  
05:05 05:08 MALE: Oh, doing this?  Yeah.  I've never done this before.  
05:08 05:09 FEMALE: Would you do it again?  
05:10 05:11 MALE: What's that?  
05:10 05:11 FEMALE: Would you do it again?  
05:13 05:23 MALE: Um, yeah, I think it's sort of actually a way to meet people.  I think--my only problem is that it's, like, you really don't have time to really get that [unintelligible].  Maybe not the point, but--
