0:02 0:10 MALE:  Hello.  I know.  Hi, now we can talk.  Hi, male105 [unintelligible].  
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  female133 [unintelligible].  
0:12 0:18 MALE:  So, hum, trying to come up with different questions for people?  What's your favorite food?  
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  I like chocolate.  
0:20 0:20 MALE:  Right.  
0:16 0:18 FEMALE:  Kind of a broad category.  
0:25 0:25 MALE:  Brownies?  
0:20 0:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:27 0:29 MALE:  Do you have any dishes that you like to make?  
0:25 0:27 FEMALE:  I like to make couscous.  
0:33 0:36 MALE:  Couscous.  How do you make those?  
0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  How do you make couscous?  You just boil water.  
0:40 0:52 MALE:  Oh, it's like little tiny pasta type things. For a moment I was like I've had couscous.  I know the name.  What is it?  Yeah, it's like asking how do you make rice?  
0:46 0:49 FEMALE:  Do you cook much?  
0:56 0:58 MALE:  I'm part of one of the eating clubs so--
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Oh, okay.  
1:00 1:06 MALE:  Quakers, so every Thursday I cook for 25 people or so.  It's kind of fun.  
1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  Oh. 
1:08 1:16 MALE:  So, today we did Korean barbecue chicken--I mean Korean barbecue pork, rice, and a radish and apple salad.  It was fun.  
1:11 1:13 FEMALE:  So, is it a vegetarian [unintelligible]?  
1:19 1:21 MALE:  We don't have any fortunately.  
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:22 1:37 MALE:  We have somebody who is really, really picky about their food, and so my cooking partner and I have started doing the MFA scores, minimum flavor alternatives.  Basically, we take the meat.  We put it in a pan.  We don't add anything to it, and they love it.  
1:32 1:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, I agree.  [unintelligible] a lot of the coops, and there are a couple of vegans in their house.  Every time they cook they have to make vegan.  
1:50 2:09 MALE:  My partner and I last quarter we did three vegetarian recipes in a row, three for the whole quarter, and all of the sudden we got this reputation that all we cook is vegetarian when we haven't made a single vegetarian meal in the last four months.  What are you--no.  It's a lot of fun.  So, what department are you in?  
2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  Economics.  
2:10 2:10 MALE:  Wow, nice.  
2:05 2:06 FEMALE:  What are you doing here?  
2:12 2:14 MALE:  Engineering, a big surprise.  
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  what year are you in?  
2:16 2:17 MALE:  I am a first year.  
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  How is that to you?  
2:21 2:28 MALE:  Good, it took me about six months to get back into it.  I've been out of it for four years.  So that was--the whole--
2:23 2:26 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Were you working the, were you--
2:33 2:39 MALE: [interposing]  I was working for Intel for a while and for GM for a while.  It was good, but--
2:34 2:43 FEMALE:  How is Intel?  How often is it that they address the [unintelligible]?  Like, [laughter].  
2:50 3:25 MALE:  You have to do a [unintelligible] and then a [unintelligible], and so they do the whole ranking process every six months.  But only one of them really counts.  But the other one kind of counts too.  And it's the worst like it's good in some ways because it gets you very productive.  But you can sort of see people's productivity kind of go up and then go down, and then go up and then go down.  I don't know.  I know more people complained about it than they enjoyed it.  But it was fun.  I like working, and--
3:19 3:21 FEMALE:  At Intel?  
3:27 3:35 MALE:  Just in general.  I actually looked forward to going to work there every day.  So, there's a lot of cool people in my group.  Did you go straight from undergrad to--
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
3:37 3:40 MALE:  So, how has it been keeping it solid for that long?  
3:34 3:58 FEMALE:  I kind of regret it actually because I think that I don't know if you have [unintelligible] more stressed out [unintelligible] here.  You don't really see the alternative, you know.  Whereas I was talking to some [unintelligible] people at work before who kind of have a sense of, okay, well, if something doesn't work out here, I can always go.  It's okay.  Whereas I really wish I would have--okay, are you from Berkley.  
4:06 4:08 MALE:  The thing about that is it's hard to come back.  
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
4:09 4:11 MALE:  It was nice talking to you.  Have a good one.
