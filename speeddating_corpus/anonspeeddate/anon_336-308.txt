0:00 0:11 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] frequently quiet this time around.  I think they decided we haven't been serious enough about our evaluations.  I don't know if you noticed the hash that fell over the room for this round of--

0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  Oh, really?

0:12 0:13 MALE:  --of scoring.

0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  People were...

0:14 0:14 MALE:  It's a little disconcerting.

0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.

0:18 0:20 MALE:  So, what--what program are you in?  What are you studying?

0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  I study medicine.  I'm in my second year.

0:21 0:25 MALE:  Pretty cool.  Like straight up MD or, um, Ph.D. program?

0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  MD.

0:27 0:28 MALE:  Do you love it or hate it?

0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  I actually really love it.  I mean--

0:30 0:33 MALE:  You never know, I mean, it's a rough four years.

0:33 0:35 FEMALE:  No, I know people who don't like it and I--I really feel I love it.

0:35 0:43 MALE:  And you try not to associate with them too much.  Yeah, I'm a law student.  If they don't like law, I'm not wasting time talking to them.

0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  No.  [laughter].

0:44 0:50 MALE:  You're here for a reason, right?  [unintelligible] I don't know.  What comes after this do you know, like, what discipline you're interested in?

0:50 1:00 FEMALE:  Um, uh, I--I really don't know.  I've been exposed to and really enjoy oncology, emergency medicine.  I really like the [unintelligible].

1:01 1:09 MALE:  Here is the wonderful thing of medicine, you can't go wrong.  You're doing wonderful things.  The way where as me, I can sap all kinds of value from the world if I'm not careful so.

1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  [laughter].

1:11 1:12 MALE:  So, do you live on campus or off campus?

1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  Um-hum.  I'm on campus [unintelligible].

1:13 1:18 MALE:  Me too.  I live in Carouthers [phonetic], which is build as the worst grad dorm on campus.

1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  Oh, right, right, right.  

1:19 1:22 MALE:  But it's the law school [unintelligible], so I like it.

1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  Do you like that, do you like hanging out with your classmates or...?

1:23 1:38  MALE:  I love them.  It's a real--I mean, it's good, it's bad, right.  Because they are such a great group of people and we hang out so much and the only downside is that, you know, you don't really get an incentive to make an effort to get out there, you know, get to know other people.  But most other people are overrated, so.

1:39 1:39 FEMALE:  Right, right.

1:39 1:43 MALE:  Do you find that you're mostly just kind of into med school sort of social scene?

1:43 1:52 FEMALE:  Um, actually I--I mean, we--we are really tight with our class because you just found--we have like seven hours of lecture a week--a day or something.

1:53 1:54 MALE:  Oh, my.  Everyday?

1:54 1:54 FEMALE:  And so--yeah.  

1:55 1:55 MALE:  Good Lord.

1:55 1:58 FEMALE:  I mean, this quarter less so, but yeah.

1:58 1:59 MALE:  Is anything [unintelligible] for you all?

2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:01 2:01 MALE:  Oh, that helps.

2:02 2:03  FEMALE:  Well, it's just like you guys, right?

2:03 2:05 MALE:  No.  Yeah, I mean, right.  You're absolutely right.

2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  You guys have like honors, which is really like great.

2:07 2:14 MALE:  We have grades.  Well, we get like, you know, two pass fails that we can use whenever we want.  Oh, awful system, but, you know.

2:14 2:18 FEMALE:  Um, but you can--can you get two passes--so you can--but it is kind of great.

2:19 2:22 MALE:  You get like a floating pass, fail, fail [unintelligible], so you can choose to take two courses over that.  Well, after your first semester that's [unintelligible].

2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:24 2:27 MALE:  Where were you before?  Did you come straight here from school or were you working?

2:27 2:33 FEMALE:  No, I, um, I was in Princeton.  I studied [unintelligible] biology.  And then I studied physics in England and then--yeah.

2:33 2:34 MALE:  Wow.  Where in England?

2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  I was in Oxford.

2:35 2:35  MALE:  I think I heard.

2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.

2:37 2:39 MALE:  [unintelligible].  So, did [unintelligible]--did you know that you were going to end up in med school?

2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  I had absolutely no idea.

2:41 2:41 MALE:  Oh, really?

2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No.

2:43 2:43 MALE:  What happened?

2:43 3:02 FEMALE:  Um, I thought I was going to do biophysics and I--but I started volunteering at a clinic and I really liked to do--I loved interacting with patients.  I like the instant gratification that you get just talking to people, making connections with people, and helping them out and so I switched from [unintelligible] to patients and yeah. 

3:02 3:04 MALE:  You can't argue with that.  Not too many regrets about it.

3:05 3:14 FEMALE:  Actually, no.  I mean, it's hard and sometimes I'm like am I cut out for this, can I memorize all of this stuff.  I mean, it's so much stuff.  I can't even--I never even imagined.

3:14 3:21 MALE:  I cannot imagine.  We get [unintelligible], you know, let me perfectly honest.  We have open book exams it's not as bad as, you know.

3:21 3:22 FEMALE:  You guys have open book exams?

3:22 3:24 MALE:  It's sick isn't it?  And we still find that difficult.

3:24 3:25 FEMALE:  All the time?

3:25 3:35 MALE:  Look, there's, you know, some of us just weren't cut out to do well on the M CAT, so there had to be a place for us.  Um, but, yeah, for the most part so--so, that's good.

3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  You worked [unintelligible]?

3:36 3:53 MALE:  I'll probably work for a firm--well, sort of like court for a year.  We are [unintelligible] an apprentice to judge and then I'll work at a firm for a few years.  What I'd really like to do then is a little criminal prosecution like federal law and stuff working for a US Attorney's Office.  And then my long-term dream is to be a trial court judge, but yeah.

3:53 3:53 FEMALE:  A what?

3:54 3:54 MALE:  A trial court judge.

3:55 3:55 FEMALE:  Okay.

3:55 3:58 MALE:  Um, but things change, you never know.  So, um, so we'll see I don't know.

3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  What's a trial court judge and why do you want to do it?

4:01 4:22 MALE:  Oh, well, so, you know, um, the reason I say that is because there are like appellate judges and trial judges.  A trial judge being--it's a person that if you sue somebody or the government brings a criminal prosecution or a civil suit against somebody, you're the judge.  Um, a fellow judge being, you know, like in circuit courts and supreme courts, and I just find that trial work is a little more interesting.

4:22 4:22 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

4:23 4:24 MALE:  It's really good to meet you.

4:24 4:25 FEMALE:  Bye male308.
