0:00 0:02 FEMALE:  H.  female328.
0:03 0:03 MALE:  I'm male313.
0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male313.
0:04 0:09 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  Let me fill in your info here.  All right.
0:10 0:12 FEMALE:  Oh.  Okay.  We can officially talk.
0:12 0:13 MALE:  Excellent.  Good.  I don't want to mess up the study.
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  [laughter].  
0:15 0:16 MALE:  Wow.  How are things going?
0:16 0:18 FEMALE:  Oh, pretty good.  Is your little red light on?
0:19 0:20 MALE:  I don't know that I have a little red light.
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  Yours is different from mine.
0:22 0:24 MALE:  Yeah, the ladies and the guys have been--I don't know.
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  [interposing] I'm sure it is.
0:25 0:27 MALE:  I have no idea whether this thing is still on.
0:27 0:31 FEMALE:  But you know what?  Their research purposes are not really my main purposes.
0:31 0:35 MALE:  Exactly.  I'm--I'm kind of always letting it slip down.  It's already fallen on the floor.
0:35 0:36 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:37 0:37 MALE:  I know someone [unintelligible].
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  All right.  So what's your purpose?
0:39 0:40 MALE:  What is my purpose?  Meeting people.
0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  Sounds good.
0:42 0:45 MALE:  And, you know, I was helping her out, like you know, she needed women for this thing.
0:45 0:45 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:45 0:50 MALE:  So I was kind of helping her emailing the dorm list and telling my friends.  So now I kind of like come see how it goes.
0:51 0:53 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  So dorm list.  What are you--what do you do at Stanford?
0:54 0:56 MALE:  Um so I'm a grad student in CS, CSP.
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh interesting.
0:57 0:59 MALE:  My dorm is essentially in the studio [unintelligible].
0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:00 1:03 MALE:  I call it the dorm 'cause that's what the underclass say, the dorm.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  Well, what do you do in CS?
1:06 1:06 MALE:  Verification.
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:07 1:09 MALE:  Improving practice of programs.
1:09 1:09 FEMALE:  How interesting.
1:10 1:14 MALE:  Yeah, it's actually really hard.  It's totally kicking my butt right now.  Things that we feel like we should be able to solve--
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
1:15 1:16 MALE:  --and we just go round and round in circles.
1:17 1:20 FEMALE:  The CSP [unintelligible] program is like impossible to get into from what I hear.
1:21 1:24 MALE:  Is it?  I don't know.  What do you do?
1:24 1:29 FEMALE:  Um I'm a bit--I'm getting my MBA at the business school.
1:28 1:28 MALE:  Oh cool.
1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  Second year.  Um--yeah.
1:30 1:31 MALE:  So how do you like it?
1:32 1:38 FEMALE:  Uh I like it a lot.  I've learned a tremendous amount and I--it's been a great experience.  Although I still haven't learned to play golf, which--
1:39 1:41 MALE:  [interposing] Oh, you have to do that I guess to [unintelligible] some people or anything.
1:40 1:42 FEMALE:  I know.  I know.  I got to--got to get on it.
1:42 1:45 MALE:  I don't know.  That's going to be on the final.  You can't graduate unless you can--
1:45 1:48 FEMALE:  So I've been told.  If I walk on the 12th, I got to learn to play golf.
1:48 1:48 MALE:  Wow.
1:49 1:54 FEMALE:  But it's okay.  I'll--I'll be staying in the area, and I hear that alumni's still get decent rate--decent rates at the golf course.
1:54 1:59 MALE:  Over at the Stanford Golf Course.  Yeah, I've been over there.  I've never played though.  I actually never played--I been putt-putt golf, but not--not real golf.
1:59 2:01 FEMALE:  Exactly.  Mini golf is good.
2:01 2:09 MALE:  Yeah, mini golf.  Although sometimes I just feel like wow, this is impossible.  Even at--even at putt-putt.  So driving down the green, I don't know.
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:09 2:16 MALE:  I think I'd be terrible.  Is--actually is it good to be bad?  Maybe you--you can butter up the clients by losing to them.  I don't know.
2:16 2:20 FEMALE:  I think--I think you don't want to beat them, but I think you don't want to be like so far behind that you hold them up.
2:20 2:20 MALE:  Okay.
2:20 2:23 FEMALE:  So that's as--that's what I got to figure out how to do.
2:22 2:23 MALE:  All right.  So there's got to be--
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  [interposing] Exactly.
2:23 2:28 MALE:  Now would you actually--would you actually do that?  Like what if you were really good?  Would you throw the game for them if they were an important client?
2:29 2:39 FEMALE:  I uh--I don't know.  I don't know.  I might--I might concentrate less, but I'm not sure I would intentionally throw the game.
2:39 2:41 MALE:  Oh no, I went into the weeds.  What's going to happen?
2:41 2:48 FEMALE:  See, I'm a terrible liar, so I'm not sure I can pull it off.  So maybe that's just my way of avoiding the ethical dilemma is that--
2:48 2:48 MALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
2:49 2:51 FEMALE:  --my constitution will not--not let me get into the excellent level.
2:52 2:54 MALE:  Well, if it happens, it happens.  I just did, wow.
2:54 2:57 FEMALE:  But I don't think that'll ever be a problem.  Even my--
2:58 2:58 MALE:  [interposing] You could be great.
2:58 3:00 FEMALE:  --hand-eye coordination, not so much.
3:00 3:02 MALE:  You could be the next [unintelligible] or something.  I don't know.
3:02 3:04 FEMALE:  Uh I'm good at Tetris.  Other than that--
3:04 3:07 MALE:  [interposing] I love Tetris.  I dream in Tetris.  Have you ever done that?
3:07 3:08 FEMALE:  I've dreamt in 3-D Tetris.
3:09 3:10 MALE:  Wow.  That's pretty cool.
3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  It's kind of sad.
3:12 3:16 MALE:  It's actually pretty cool.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I'll randomize the blocks and I'll--
3:17 3:19 FEMALE:  [interposing] [laughter].
3:17 3:22 MALE:  --imagine where they'd go.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to go to sleep tossing and turning.  That's when you know you've been playing too much Tetris.
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  Clearly.
3:23 3:24 MALE:  I think I also have dreamt in FreeCell.
3:25 3:27 FEMALE:  What's--I--I know--I've heard of FreeCell.
3:27 3:28 MALE:  It's solitaire on windows.
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
3:30 3:30 MALE:  Yeah.
3:31 3:31 FEMALE:  Okay.  [laughter].
3:32 3:34 MALE:  Not good.  I waste way too much time on that.  What do you do for fun--
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh lately--
3:35 3:36 MALE:  --other than Tetris?
3:37 3:39 FEMALE:  Oh well, lately, robotics.
3:40 3:40 MALE:  Cool.
3:41 3:45 FEMALE:  Well, uh I'm working with a--I'm working with a startup that's doing consumer robotics.
3:45 3:46 MALE:  Oh, very nice.
3:46 3:53 FEMALE:  So I'm not sure that falls into fun.  So I--I like 80s music, and I like dancing, and I like hanging out with my friends.  
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.
3:54 3:58 FEMALE:  And I like to read, although I don't get much time.
3:58 4:01 MALE:  I love to read, and I just do it even if I should be doing research.  It's really bad.
4:01 4:01 FEMALE:  What do you read?
4:02 4:03 MALE:  Sci-Fi, classics--
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  [interposing] Okay.
4:04 4:04 MALE:  --poetry, kind of big.
4:05 4:08 FEMALE:  You--you've been to see uh um Hitchhikers Guide?
4:07 4:08 MALE:  Hitchhikers Guide?  I haven't actually.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  Oh, you have to go.
4:10 4:10 MALE:  Should I--have you seen it?
4:10 4:12 FEMALE:  It's good.  It's good.  But don't--don't expect the books.
4:13 4:16 MALE:  Okay.  I read the books when I was a kid, so I don't really remember the books.
4:15 4:15 FEMALE:  Okay.  Yeah, perfect.
4:16 4:17 MALE:  Maybe that's good.
4:17 4:23 FEMALE:  Perfect, yes.  It--it prints together really well, and it's--it's just people who expect it to be like a page-for-page tenderation [phonetic].
4:23 4:24 MALE:  Yeah, and they can't possibly cram that into a movie.
4:25 4:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:26 4:26 MALE:  All right.
4:26 4:26 FEMALE:  That's fun.
4:26 4:26 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
4:27 4:27 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male313.
4:27 4:28 MALE:  Good luck.
