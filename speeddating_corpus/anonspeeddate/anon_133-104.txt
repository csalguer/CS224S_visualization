0:05 0:06 MALE:  How's it going?  
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Fine.  
0:08 0:09 MALE:  Are you enjoying yourself?  
0:10 0:12 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Have you ever done speed dating before?  
0:13 0:13 MALE: No.  
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  Okay.  Okay.  
0:15 0:15 MALE:  And you?  
0:16 0:19 FEMALE:  Once.  I did it at Weyman's where they  have it.  
0:19 0:19 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
0:20 0:34 FEMALE:  It seems like at first you have better matches, and then [unintelligible] get tired and don't really [unintelligible].  Yeah, we'll see if that trend continues or--
0:35 0:36 MALE:  [interposing]  Was the list as long the last time you went?  
0:37 0:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was longer actually.  So, I mean the number of people--well, we had to talk for two and a half hours.  So there were more people.  So, [unintelligible] were major in what year you were in and where you were from [unintelligible].  
0:51 0:52 MALE:  I've been kind of avoiding talking about my major. 
0:52 0:54 FEMALE:  Okay, what is your major?  
0:54 0:55 MALE:  Computer science.  
0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  Well, it's not bad.  
0:58 0:59 MALE:  Yeah, just [unintelligible].  
1:00 1:03 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  Oh.  [laughter]  
1:04 1:06 MALE:  I'd rather talk about [unintelligible].  
1:07 1:12 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So, why are you doing--how are you doing with business changes [unintelligible]?  
1:13 1:20 MALE: Yeah, I just don't [unintelligible] doing this anymore.  I've got [unintelligible].  What about you?  
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  I'm [unintelligible].  
1:22 1:24 MALE:  That's kind of [unintelligible].  
1:25 1:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, it is sometimes.  It' s a lot of math.  
1:28 1:29 MALE:  How much time do you have left?  
1:33 1:40 FEMALE:  Uh, three to four years.  I'm a second year.  So [unintelligible].  
1:41 1:45 MALE:  Yeah, that sounds pretty awful. 
1:45 1:57 FEMALE:  I mean the first couple years are hard [unintelligible], and in a couple of years when you're kind of [unintelligible], not really, you know.  And then it will kind of be like [unintelligible].  
1:57 1:59 MALE:  So do you recognize [unintelligible].  
1:59 2:02 FEMALE:  No, this is my second year, so I'm finishing up my fourth quarter now.  
2:02 2:02 MALE:  Oh.  
2:02 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, so I'm--
2:05 2:07 MALE:  [interposing]  How many times do you [unintelligible]?  
2:08 2:16 FEMALE:  You know, I think [unintelligible] went for each [unintelligible].  They're called variables, you know, so it doesn't really mean anything.  
2:16 2:17 MALE:  I don't know.  
2:17 2:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible].  
2:21 2:29 MALE:  Seven times I [unintelligible].  That's why--so hopefully my [unintelligible].  I don't like that too much.  
2:29 2:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, the first year is pretty bad.  You don't really get a [unintelligible] in.  The second year most of the classes don't really help a lot.  It's so--you know, you throw your [unintelligible] and then you get out.  
2:44 2:46 MALE:  So, what's your program?  
2:47 2:58 FEMALE:  I think [unintelligible] and regulations.  So, like anti-trust and monopoly stuff--that, you know [unintelligible].  
2:58 3:01 MALE:  So, it's kind of like [unintelligible].  
3:01 3:05 FEMALE:  Well, the [unintelligible] also.  
3:05 3:06 MALE:  So, it is [unintelligible] that?  
3:08 3:10 FEMALE:  In the--in the cycle?  
3:10 3:15 MALE:  I don't know that.  I would think like on a scale that's like [unintelligible].  
3:16 3:29 FEMALE:  I think it depends on what you focus on.  There was like political economy stuff, but roll with that--you know, how people vote, [unintelligible], and that.  Some [unintelligible].  So, something along those lines.  
3:30 3:37 MALE:  So, I'm free and going to mess up the date now.  [unintelligible].  I'm sick of [unintelligible].  
3:38 3:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, my first year was pretty rough.  This one has been a little bit better, but [unintelligible].  [laughter]  So, I want the quarter to be over.  Next year will be a lot better.  
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  Hopefully.  
3:55 3:56 MALE: Nice meeting you.  
3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
