0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  I'm from Spain. 

0:30 0:30 MALE:  Spain, okay. 

0:31 0:31 FEMALE:  Yep. 

0:32 0:32 MALE:  Whereabouts in Spain? 

0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  Barcelona. 

0:33 0:33 MALE:  Oh okay.  I know that because of the Olympics. 

0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] the '92 Olympic games.  I worked there. 

0:40 0:41 MALE:  Okay.  Did you see anything cool? 

0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  What? 

0:42 0:42 MALE:  Did you see anything cool? 

0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Yeah the Dream Team. 

0:44 0:45 MALE:  Oh really, the basketball, yeah. 

0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  Yeah basketball.  Yeah I was a volunteer so I saw all the Dream Team and I was like [unintelligible]. 

0:50 0:51 MALE:  That must have been really, really cool. 

0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Yeah it was amazing. 

0:53 0:53 MALE:  My one Olympic story is that I went to the Olympics in Salt Lake -- 

0:57 0:58 FEMALE:  Okay. 

0:58 0:58 MALE:  When it was here -- in 2002 in the winter. 

1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  Okay. 

1:00 1:01 MALE:  It was in Salt Lake City. 

1:01 1:02 FEMALE:  Salt Lake, where is that? 

1:03 1:03 MALE: It's in Utah. 

1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  Okay. 

1:04 1:05 MALE:  So, two states east of here. 

1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  Sure, sure. 

1:07 1:08 MALE:  But dad's got family out there and we -- it was easy for us to go and so we just went and got to see -- 

1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  With the whole family? 

1:18 1:19 MALE:  Well, not so much, but most of the -- the whole, my brothers and my parents essentially and then a couple friends and all that, but it was great.  Like the whole international sort of like energy and everyone moving around and just everyone seemed there just to have fun and enjoy themselves and it was really kind of -- it was great, it was great. 

1:44 1:44 FEMALE:  I love it.  It was a good -- I was a volunteer. 

1:45 1:46 MALE:  Okay. 

1:46 1:46 FEMALE:  So I -- I still -- [unintelligible] come inside, it was amazing, it was like wow. 

1:52 1:53  MALE:  That's got to be, that's got to be really cool. 

1:54 1:54 FEMALE:  But it was a little bit depressing in a part because it's so much money and so much effort and it's so short and it's finished and you think, okay and the money went -- 

2:03 2:03  MALE:  What happened, yeah it's gone. 

2:03 2:04 FEMALE:  So it's also a little bit frustrating in a way because it's just sports and they spend so much money. 

2:09 2:12 MALE:  So what's your major? 

2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  I'm doing law. 

2:14 2:14 MALE:  You're in law? 

2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  I'm doing a Masters. 

2:16 2:17 MALE:  Okay. 

2:17 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm [unintelligible] I'm doing law.  And what are you doing?  

2:21 2:21 MALE:  I'm an electrical engineer. 

2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  Masters, PhD? 

2:23 2:24 MALE:  PhD. 

2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  Which year? 

2:25 2:26 MALE:  First. 

2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  That's a scary one, no?  Because you just arrived and you have to do all the classes? 

2:31 2:33 MALE:  And the classes are -- they're ridiculous, they're insane. 

2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  A lot of work. 

2:37 2:37 MALE:  They're absurd, so yeah. 

2:39 2:40 FEMALE:  I know, I know.  I have a couple of PhD dates tonight in engineer, an electrical engineer and they were all saying that the first year is horrible. 

2:47 2:48 MALE:  Yeah, yeah -- 

2:48 2:49 FEMALE:  But the second year they just have holidays, so -- 

2:51 2:52 MALE:  I've had fun up to this point; I've had a good time, so I think I've got just one more quarter to get through and -- 

2:58 2:58 FEMALE:  Why did you want to do a PhD?  [unintelligible] all that much? 

3:01 3:03 MALE:  [laughter] it's just not right [laughter].  Why would I want to do this?  Well, that's been a question that's been on my mind quite a bit lately and -- 

3:10 3:11 FEMALE:  You are doing -- I mean you -- how does it work in America, you have an undergraduate in engineering? 

3:15 3:16 MALE:  I have an undergraduate in engineering and a Masters in mechanical engineering and professional certification, I worked for five years while -- 

3:24 3:24 FEMALE:  And you say, now -- 

3:24 3:25 MALE:  I decided I'm coming back -- 

3:26 3:27 FEMALE:  Why? 

3:27 3:28 MALE:  -- to school.  Why?  Well, at that time it was always something that I wanted to do.  I wanted to do original research. 

3:38 3:38 FEMALE:  The PhD? 

3:38 3:39 MALE:  I mean yeah original research.  Original research is important and a PhD is something that if you want to do original research professionally, the PhD becomes a must--have. 

3:49 3:49 FEMALE:  Okay. 

3:50 3:50 MALE:  So, it was always something I was kind of interested in and wanted to try and then it would open up other things that I could potentially do. 

4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Like for example? 

4:01 4:02 MALE:  Research for the government, industry, for academia and it also allows, you know, I can teach if I wanted to. 

4:10 4:10 FEMALE:  You would like to do that? 

4:11 4:11 MALE:  I've considered it, but there's, you know, a little bit of, well okay there's a lot a bit of jumping through hoops and 

4:18 4:18 FEMALE:  Jumping through? 

4:19 4:19 MALE:  Jumping through hoops. 

4:20 4:20 FEMALE:  What does it mean?  I don't know that term. 

4:21 4:22 MALE:  It means a lot of -- 

4:23 4:24 FEMALE:  Now you're doing an English class also. 

4:26 4:26 MALE:  Yes, yes, yes, so jumping through hoops is something that, I'll pretend that wasn't the horn.  Jumping through hoops is something they train animals to do. 

4:36 4:36 FEMALE:  Okay. 

4:37 4:38 MALE:  So you hold up a hoop and the dog jumps back and forth through it. 

4:39 4:40 FEMALE:  Oh yes okay. 

4:40 4:41 MALE:  So it's almost like a useless sort of extra work that doesn't really --  

4:48 4:50 FEMALE:  Make a difference. 

4:50 4:50 MALE:  Make a difference, yeah, yeah. 

4:51 4:52 FEMALE:  Okay. 

4:52 4:53 MALE:  So jumping through hoops. 

4:55 4:56 FEMALE:  Okay.
