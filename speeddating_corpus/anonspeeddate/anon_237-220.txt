00:19  00:26	FEMALE:  Well, I don't want to take any ownership or anything over it, but we certainly probably got a disproportionate number of the emails about it [laughter].
00:27  00:36	MALE:  Yeah, we didn't learn about it, like -- well I didn't learn about it until like um, ah, until like last week or two weeks ago.  At least I think there was an email with all the information so. 
00:37  00:42	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  You found out eventually [laughter].  Word gets around.
00:43  00:44	MALE:  Yeah, yeah, but its fun.  So what kind of -- are you PhD student or?
00:44  00:55	FEMALE:  No, I'm a Masters student doing History, Philosophy of Education rhetoric, stuff like that.  So the fuzzy, really fuzzy humanity type of education.

00:57  00:58	FEMALE:  So, it's fun.  What about you?
00:59  01:00	MALE:  I'm an engineering student, so I'm in the electrical engineering.
01:00  01:01	FEMALE:  What kind, electrical.
01:02  01:05	MALE:  Yeah.  I guess there must have been a lot of electrical --
01:06  01:09	FEMALE:  There's been a bunch -- there's been a bunch of aero/astro more than anything it seems tonight.
01:10  01:14	MALE:  It must be -- it must be more [unintelligible].  I always meet the aero/astro guys it seems like.
01:15  01:19	FEMALE:  I have no idea [laughter].  So what do you do around here?  Where might you have seen me before?
01:20  01:31	MALE:  And um, ah, I'm into like running and snowboarding and those kinds of things.  And ah, ah, yeah and outdoor stuff I'm from Colorado, so -- 
01:32  01:33	FEMALE:  Nice.
01:34  01:34	MALE:  Yeah, I'm into hiking and camping those kinds of things.
01:35  01:36	FEMALE:  Awesome, awesome.  That's great.
01:36  01:37	MALE:   Reading watching movies, that's about it.
01:37  01:43	FEMALE:  Yeah.  That's sounds awesome.  Where's your favorite place to go hiking or backpacking or?
01:44  01:52	MALE:  Um, you know I don't have a favorite place.  I -- I never go to the same place.  Ah, I like Tahoe, I mean I like that sort of Alpine lakes and rocky stuff like that.  
01:53  01:54	FEMALE:  Nice.
01:55  01:56	MALE:  And of course the Yosemite's and stuff like that.  How about you, are you a backpacker or?
01:56  02:12	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I lived in Oregon for two years before I moved down here and I know -- I mean I'm no expert on Oregon, but I know places up there more than I've been able to get out around here, so.  But, just everything up around Hood or Sister's or whatever, but yeah that's sort of Alpine [laughter].
02:13  02:14	MALE:  Cool, yeah.
02:15  02:15	FEMALE:  Area is really fun.
02:16  02:18	MALE:  So are you like into technical stuff or just ah --?
02:19  02:42	FEMALE:  I haven't done much technical stuff at all.  One of my old housemates was a really technical like always off on some new route or whatever.  No, it was more like go where I can snowshoe without any [laughter] other stuff.  I would be interested in learning more technical stuff, but I've sort of never been in the situation to be able to do that.  But --
02:43  02:44	MALE:  Yeah, you ever go with the outing club? 
02:44  02:47	FEMALE:  Not here, I haven't actually.  Um, have you done stuff around here?
02:48  02:54	MALE:  I've done a few things with them, its pretty fun I mean it's always nice when someone else organizes the trip.
02:55  02:55	FEMALE:  Sure takes care of logistics.
02:56  02:57	MALE:  And everyone is really -- everyone is really nice. 
02:58  02:58	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:58  02:59	MALE:  So, yeah.  
02:59  03:13	FEMALE:  Yeah, no, I feel like I kind of got into a swirl around here.  Like did they have [unintelligible], but it's all right.  I've been able to do a little exploring not as much that would have been ideal.
03:14  03:15	MALE:  So how about, what year are you in?
03:15  03:17	FEMALE:  I'm a Masters student.  So, just one year. 
03:18  03:19	MALE:  Oh, so your, nine months right?
03:19  03:24	FEMALE:  No, one that's right.  There's one one-year Masters Program I think.  But yeah, nine months get them in and out.
03:25  03:27	MALE:  So do you know what you're doing next?
03:28  03:51	FEMALE:  No idea.  I'm um, interested in education journalism, so it's just a lot of applying for jobs all over and hoping someone kind of bites.  Um, yeah.  So and it's also the kind of thing that no one hires a tremendous amount ahead of time.  So, now is the time to sort of start applying and see where it goes.  It could be anywhere at this point, so. 
03:52  03:52	MALE:  Cool.  Yeah but --
03:53  03:54	FEMALE:  Yeah, it's kind of cool I like it.
03:54  03:58	MALE:  No, it should be really interesting I mean I like it's an important profession right?  I mean --
03:59  04:14	FEMALE:  I like to think so [laughter].  Yeah, I like to [unintelligible].  I mean for me it works really well because like [horn] -- well.  The nice thing about journalism is that there's always sort of like a news story right?  So, there's always something new to me, like check out, it won't get boring.  Well, nice to meet you.
04:15  04:16	MALE:  Cool.  I was nice to meet you.  Have fun
04:17  04:17	FEMALE:  You too.
