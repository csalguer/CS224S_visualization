0:03 0:04 FEMALE: Hi, I'm female325.
0:06 0:07 MALE: Nice meeting you. I'm nameX.
0:08 0:08 FEMALE: Hey. What do you do at Stanford?
0:08 0:10 MALE: I'm a double E PhD student.
0:11 0:11 FEMALE: Cool.
0:12 0:12 MALE: You too?
0:12 0:15 FEMALE: I actually graduated in 2001 with a CS degree.
0:17 0:24 MALE: Okay. Wait so I think you're my year then. I was a freshman in '97. Yeah. So you know tons of people that I know.
0:25 0:26 FEMALE: Maybe.
0:26 0:29 MALE: I'll have to mark you down as friend to friend. Okay. So which dorm were you in?
0:30 0:32 FEMALE: I was in Trankos [phonetic] my first year.
0:33 0:35 MALE: Trankos. Okay. So let's see. I didn't know that many Wilbur people. Did you know anybody in Flomo?
0:38 0:39 FEMALE: I don't think so.
0:40 0:41 MALE: It's weird how you can graduate and...
0:44 0:45 FEMALE: It's such a big campus.
0:45 0:45 MALE: Yeah, yeah. But let's see. You don't know nameX? Are you Korean or?
0:51 0:51 FEMALE: I'm Chinese.
0:52 0:56 MALE: Chinese, Chinese. Okay. Because I know a bunch of Korean people around here.
0:57 1:00 FEMALE: I would say 103 but the kids are younger than I am.
1:01 1:03 MALE: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: We're kind of the same age, yeah.
1:05 1:05 MALE: So what are you doing around now?
1:05 1:07 FEMALE: I actually work. I work at a company called Ingrian Systems, a start up by nameX.
1:07 1:08 MALE: What is it? Is he a professor here?
1:08 1:09 FEMALE: Yeah. Data encryption.
1:17 1:17 MALE: Wait a second, nameX?
1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:19 1:22 MALE: Wait. Did you know nameX and nameX and all those guys?
1:23 1:24 FEMALE: I think [unintelligible] used to do that. He's the last guy.
1:25 1:25 MALE: So nameX has two companies.
1:26 1:26 FEMALE: Probably.
1:27 1:27 MALE: Do you know Voltage?
1:27 1:28 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:29 1:32 MALE: Yeah. So a bunch of my buddies work voltage. They were actually co-founders and so on.
1:32 1:36 FEMALE: Yeah. I think nameX isn't quite as much in Ingrian anymore but that's what he was doing five years ago or whatever.
1:37 1:43 MALE: Oh. Yeah, yeah. So that's actually getting really big now. So what's the key tech breakthrough?
1:47 1:59 FEMALE: It's data encryption that sort of we make our clients that stores all the keys and stores all the sensitive--  It stores all the keys and encrypts and decrypts as you go over the wire to the database.
2:00 2:03 MALE: So what's your involvement with that?
2:03 2:09 FEMALE: I actually work on the UI team so I sort of do the set up work for the system. I...
2:10 2:10 MALE: Front end
2:11 2:12 FEMALE: Yeah. Front end, basically [unintelligible] and stuff.
2:12 2:15 MALE: Awesome. So are you based in Paolo Alto?
2:15 2:16 FEMALE: Redwood City.
2:19 2:19 MALE: So how'd you hear about this?
2:20 2:23 FEMALE: My sister actually took me. She's still a student.
2:24 2:25 MALE: What's she doing?
2:28 2:28 FEMALE: She is material science.
2:28 2:31 MALE: Material science. Great. So engineering runs in the blood, huh?
2:31 2:31 FEMALE: Yeah. I guess so. I don't know.
2:33 2:40 MALE: Well, my younger brother is more practical than me. He's out working on Wall Street right now. Yeah, so do you have any other siblings other than your sister?
2:42 2:42 FEMALE: Just the two of us.
2:43 2:45 MALE: Do you have rhyming names?
2:46 2:49 FEMALE: No. Her name's nameX, she's over there. But J and T, not quite.
2:50 3:00 MALE: No. Well actually J is just an abbreviation for my full name, which is Pali Slavic. You don't want to try to pronounce it. 
3:01 3:01 FEMALE: So what do you do now?
3:03 3:10 MALE: What am I doing now? Actually now that I'm graduating I entering for a faculty position. I actually fly to MIT tomorrow.
3:11 3:13 FEMALE: Cool. You should talk to her she went there.
3:14 3:14 MALE: Oh really? Wow. Okay. Is she graduating this year also? Is she older?
3:15 3:22 FEMALE: She's done. No. She graduated from MIT, she's here as a Masters student. But she went there so she'll tell you all about it.
3:23 3:24 MALE: Did she do material science there also?
3:27 3:29 FEMALE: I do know a few people who are not faculty but PhD candidates.
3:33 3:33 MALE: At MIT?
3:36 3:36 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.
3:37 3:42 MALE: Yeah. Me, too. It's a bunch of guys from Stanford that went over there. So I'm going to booze with all of them after I decompress.
3:43 3:45 FEMALE: It's a good It's really fun.
3:46 3:54 MALE: I'm actually not going trying to get into double E, though. I work in bioex so I'm trying to get into the Whitehead Institute, that's like genomics. Because I work on genetic circuits.
3:55 3:55 FEMALE: I think that's really cool.
3:56 4:05 MALE: So it's not double E per se, but the nice thing is I'm like if you do a bio PhD after a post doc then [unintelligible] so anyway. All right. Well good meeting you.
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: It was nice meeting you, nameX.
