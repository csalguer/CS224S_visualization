0:01 0:03 FEMALE: Hey.  How are you?
0:00 0:02 MALE: Good. This is beginning to get to me now. 
0:06 0:08 FEMALE: This is--yeah.  Letter N. 
0:06 0:08 MALE: They need to get a better-sounding horn than that.
0:11 0:13 FEMALE: Don't you think it's getting louder?
0:09 0:10 MALE: Yes. 
0:13 0:14 FEMALE: And more screech--like?
0:11 0:13 MALE: Yes, especially [unintelligible].
0:17 0:19 FEMALE: Eeee.  [laughter]  It's just--but anyway, female334. 
0:15 0:16 MALE: Okay.  But--male306 [phonetic]. 
0:20 0:20 FEMALE: male306?
0:17 0:17 MALE: Yeah. 
0:21 0:21 FEMALE: Nice to meet you. 
0:17 0:20 MALE: Nice to meet you, too, again. [unintelligible]  
0:24 0:24 FEMALE: [laughter] Yeah. 
0:20 0:22 MALE: So like, anybody, that's the first question.  It's, "What do you do?"
0:26 0:29 FEMALE: Yeah.  I'm a--I'm in immunology over at th-- 
0:25 0:26 MALE: Immunology? Uh, medi--
0:30 0:31 FEMALE: In the medical school.
0:27 0:28 MALE: In the medical school.  Okay. 
0:31 0:32 FEMALE: Yeah.  PhD program. 
0:29 0:29 MALE: Okay. 
0:33 0:34 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:30 0:31 MALE: So you're going to be here, like, forever. 
0:35 0:37 FEMALE: For, like, four more years, yeah. 
0:33 0:34 MALE: Four?  So how long have you been here?
0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Uh, this is my first year. 
0:36 0:37 MALE: Oh, okay. 
0:41 0:42 FEMALE: Yeah.  What about you?  What are you studying?
0:39 0:39 MALE: I'm in a master's program.
0:43 0:43 FEMALE: In?
0:40 0:40 MALE: In MS and A. 
0:45 0:46 FEMALE: Oh, that's Material Sciences?
0:42 0:44 MALE: No, no, no.  Management Science and [unintelligible]. 
0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Management sciences.
0:44 0:45 MALE: [unintelligible].
0:50 0:51 FEMALE: Okay.  How do you like that?
0:48 0:52 MALE: Good.  I'm [unintelligible] I don't take any class in MS and A.  I'm, like, halfway into B-School. 
0:57 0:59 FEMALE: So what do you want to do when you get out with that?
0:56 1:01 MALE: What I want to do?  Start up on my own.  I did something, actually, in medical school.
1:06 1:06 FEMALE: Where?
1:02 1:05 MALE: No, no, no.  Not classes.  Somebody from Stanford Medical Infomatics. 
1:09 1:10 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  So you--
1:06 1:07 MALE: Uh, working with--on a technology. 
1:11 1:12 FEMALE: Together, you want to start up something, or--
1:08 1:11 MALE: Yeah.  But, uh, if he--if he wants to do it.
1:16 1:17 FEMALE: What was it?  What were you working on?
1:13 1:15 MALE: Uh, segmentation of 3D medical imaging. 
1:19 1:20 FEMALE: Oh, that's neat. 
1:17 1:17 MALE: Yeah. 
1:21 1:24 FEMALE: That's pretty relevant.  Immunologists use that stuff a lot. 
1:20 1:22 MALE: Yeah.  It's, like, I don't understand biology at all. 
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: [laughter]
1:23 1:27 MALE: So I said, "You take care of technology, I'll sell the stuff." [unintelligible] sell it.  
1:31 1:35 FEMALE: So you, you think you'll be starting that soon?  You would need more funds, or--
1:30 1:33 MALE: No.  I don't think it's, it's gonna happen. 
1:36 1:37 FEMALE: Something to pass the time?  
1:34 1:34 MALE: Yeah. 
1:39 1:41 FEMALE: So what do you think you'll do in--instead?
1:38 1:41 MALE: What I will?  Probably, I'll go work in a management consulting firm. 
1:46 1:49 FEMALE: So how, how--what exactly does management consulting consist of?
1:46 1:48 MALE: They go to companies, see how they work. 
1:53 1:53 FEMALE: Um hm. 
1:49 1:57 MALE: Do a bunch of BS, tell them how to--you know, you shouldn't be doing it this way.  You should be doing it that way.  Whether they listen to you or not.  Usually don't really implement.  You just give your recommendations. 
2:02 2:02 FEMALE: Um hm. 
1:58 2:07 MALE: Foot them a bill--foot them a bill of a couple million dollars and walk home happy.  [laughter] Which is not the best thing in the world. I, I, I don't--
2:10 2:13 FEMALE: Do you--why do you want to do that, then?
2:10 2:12 MALE: Because I wanna get back into B-School [phonetic]. 
2:17 2:19 FEMALE: So you wanna do an MBA, or--
2:13 2:23 MALE: Yeah.  I'm actually looking for high-tech, high-tech companies here, but high-tech companies and marketing positions, they sort of require more work experience.  And I have only about a year's experience. 
2:27 2:30 FEMALE: So I hear there's a firm out here in McKinsley [phonetic].  McKinsley?
2:26 2:27 MALE: Yeah, McKenzie [phonetic]. 
2:31 2:31 FEMALE: McKenzie.  
2:27 2:31 MALE: Yeah.  They take you--I mean, they take you in Master's program at MBA level. 
2:36 2:36 FEMALE: Um hm. 
2:32 2:34 MALE: They don't really allow you to have too much work experience. 
2:39 2:40 FEMALE: So you thinking about--
2:35 2:38 MALE: That's a good place to start.  McKenzie is, is a good place.  I'll probably go into the technology divisions. 
2:43 2:46 FEMALE: Yeah, they've actually got an information session coming up. 
2:42 2:43 MALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.
2:46 2:49 FEMALE: Sometime soon. Um, but tomorrow, I think.  
2:45 2:49 MALE: They, they, they do a lot of recruiting in medical school also. 
2:53 2:59 FEMALE: Yeah.  I heard that.  Actually, one of my friends is going over there, but he's a, a--what's he doing?  Mechanical?  Mechanical engineering, I think. 
2:55 2:55 MALE: Yeah. 
3:00 3:03 FEMALE: Um, so he's not in the medical school. He's a friend of a friend of a friend. 
2:58 3:05 MALE: Yeah.  But they do all around, just the main expertise.  People like us are generalists, and they require specialists. 
3:11 3:12 FEMALE: So where are you from, originally?
3:08 3:08 MALE: India. 
3:12 3:15 FEMALE: India?  And then you came over here for your grad?
3:10 3:11 MALE: My master's.  
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Okay. 
3:12 3:14 MALE: I just flew in, like, in September.  That's my first time to US.
3:19 3:24 FEMALE: Oh, wow.  So have you got--have you passed your quals yet, or do you have to do quals in the master's program?
3:20 3:24 MALE: No.  I thought I was going to apply for a PhD program, and then I said, there's no way I could work that hard for five years. 
3:29 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  It's a--it's a lot of work.  I think people over in engineering work a lot more than we do over in Biology.  Contrary--
3:32 3:32 MALE: No. 
3:37 3:38 FEMALE: Yeah, I think you do. 
3:33 3:34 MALE: You do?
3:38 3:41 FEMALE: I mean, seriously, there's a lot of competition over there. 
3:36 3:39 MALE: Bi--biology schools.  I was never good at biology in school.
3:44 3:45 FEMALE: Well, it's just, to each his own, right? 
3:41 3:41 MALE: Yeah. 
3:46 3:47 FEMALE: Different strengths and everything. 
3:43 3:43 MALE: Yeah. 
3:50 3:50 FEMALE: Yeah, so--
3:46 3:47 MALE: So what brought you here?
3:52 4:11 FEMALE: Um, well, I, I went to undergrad at Iowa State, and I came here for my, um, graduate degree.  It's one of the best programs in the country.  You can't pass that up.  Um, yeah.  So I grew up in Minnesota, actually.  Land of the Lakes--10,000 Lakes.  Oh.  Oh, it was a little dimmer that time, wasn't it. 
4:07 4:08 MALE: Oh. 
4:11 4:12 FEMALE: Ah. 
4:08 4:09 MALE: It was--it was, was good to meet you, female334.
4:13 4:14 FEMALE: It was good to meet you, male306.  [unintelligible].
