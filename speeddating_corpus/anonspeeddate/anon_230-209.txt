0:24 0:27 MALE: Oh cool.  So you're next to Terman there in your little--

0:24 0:27 FEMALE: Yeah.  Actually we're in Terman.  We don't have any other building.  We're kind of [unintelligible].

0:36 0:37 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore.  

0:40 0:41 MALE: Okay.  

0:40 0:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  Which is why, like, my knowledge of American names is about next to nil.

0:43 0:46 MALE: Okay.  Oh it's cool.  female230.  So uh how long you been here?

0:43 0:48 FEMALE: I've been here, actually I went to college here, so, three years in college and now I'm a master's.

0:50 0:51 MALE: At Stanford?

0:48 0:49 FEMALE: No.  I went to Yale.

0:52 0:54 MALE: Oh great.  Great.  East Coast.

0:52 0:53 FEMALE: So yeah I was there for three years.  It was cold, oh my god.  It was cold.

0:56 0:58 MALE: It is cold, yeah.  I'm from the East Coast myself.

0:55 0:56 FEMALE: Where you from?

0:59 1:00 MALE: Connecticut, so.

0:57 1:02 FEMALE: So what--did you happen to, like, [horn] know, like, Yale or some of the other schools nearby or--?

1:05 1:06 MALE: Did I happen to know?

1:03 1:07 FEMALE: Did you know the schools--did you visit Yale or [unintelligible]?

1:10 1:16 MALE: No, I didn't.  But uh my niece is going to go there--but she just, she's decided to take uh BU over Yale, doesn't that blow your mind?

1:12 1:15 FEMALE: Oh.  Actually BU is a pretty good school too.

1:18 1:19 MALE: Oh okay.

1:15 1:19 FEMALE: In Boston, I must say.  I mean, we hate Harvard, but every time I visit Boston--

1:22 1:23 MALE: Right.  

1:20 1:22 FEMALE: --it, it strikes me as a great place to be.  There's just so much opportunity [horn] like--

1:25 1:30 MALE: Right.  Yeah I was--I was wondering what the hell's going on [laughter].

1:27 1:28 FEMALE: That's so weird.

1:31 1:32 MALE: Okay.  Yeah.

1:29 1:30 FEMALE: But uh--

1:33 1:34 MALE: Um so yeah, no.

1:31 1:32 FEMALE: It's a good place to be.

1:35 1:37 MALE: So Connecticut um, it's very beautiful in the summer though, but you weren't there in the summer, were you.

1:35 1:41 FEMALE: Well I, I was in New York for two summers, and because I had friends nearby Yale I was sometimes over.  

1:43 1:44 MALE: Yeah.  

1:41 1:43 FEMALE: It is much better, but then it gets too humid.

1:46 1:47 MALE: Oh.

1:44 1:45 FEMALE: It reminds me too much of home, you know.

1:48 1:49 MALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:45 1:49 FEMALE: Singapore is a place where 95 percent humidity is, is an everyday occurrence.

1:52 1:53 MALE: Is that right?

1:50 1:52 FEMALE: So you have no idea.  It is, it's quite serious.

1:54 1:56 MALE: So you're not going to go back there ever?

1:53 1:54 FEMALE: No I will.  I will.

1:57 1:58 MALE: You will.

1:54 1:55 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:58 1:59 MALE: Okay.  Cool.

1:56 1:59 FEMALE: My family's there.  I have no family here, so that's kind of where I'm headed, I think.

2:02 2:03 MALE: Cool.

1:59 2:00 FEMALE: Probably.

2:03 2:05 MALE: So uh then you're doing a master's.

2:02 2:03 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.  

2:06 2:08 MALE: And then you'll be done in uh, what?

2:04 2:05 FEMALE: I'll be done in June actually.

2:08 2:11 MALE: Cool.  And then what, you're going to do [unintelligible]?

2:08 2:10 FEMALE: I probably will go back, yeah.

2:12 2:13 MALE: Oh okay.  Cool.

2:10 2:12 FEMALE: I have a job offer, so that's--

2:14 2:15 MALE: Great.

2:12 2:15 FEMALE: That [unintelligible] I'm going to do.  What about yourself?  Are you a PhD or--?

2:18 2:19 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm--

2:16 2:17 FEMALE: So how many years you got left?

2:20 2:26 MALE: Well I guess--I told my advisor I got one year left.  I just told him yesterday, so we'll see uh, how that goes.

2:23 2:24 FEMALE: You mean you guys get to decide?  How?

2:27 2:31 MALE: Well, you know, it's like when you get your thesis done, right, so--

2:28 2:29 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:32 2:33 MALE: I have about--

2:30 2:31 FEMALE: You don't take any more classes?

2:34 2:38 MALE: No, I'm done with that, thank God.  This is the most stress I can handle, right here.  [laughter] 

2:35 2:36 FEMALE: Don't be stressed.

2:39 2:42 MALE: This is kind of like a final exam, isn't it, like?

2:39 2:44 FEMALE: Don't be stressed.  Like, a lot of us--at least the girls, like six of us were over at my place because uh, what happened is my suitemate is um--

2:47 2:48 MALE: Yeah.  

2:44 2:47 FEMALE: --taking a class with the professor.  And so, you know.

2:50 2:51 MALE: In sociology?

2:47 2:50 FEMALE: The professor encouraged--I don't know what the class is, but the professor encouraged all of them to go.

2:53 2:54 MALE: Okay.  Yeah.  

2:51 2:53 FEMALE: So a lot of the girls are, you know, we're just here to have a good time.

2:56 2:58 MALE: Oh yeah, yeah, that's good.

2:54 2:55 FEMALE: No stress, just a chat, you know.

2:58 2:59 MALE: That's a good uh--

2:56 2:59 FEMALE: And because I'm roommates with her and we also dragged another of our roommates.

3:02 3:03 MALE: Sure.

3:00 3:02 FEMALE: So it's, like, almost a suite girls' night out thing, so.

3:05 3:09 MALE: Great.  So you must get to the city much?  Or not?

3:06 3:07 FEMALE: San Francisco?  

3:10 3:11 MALE: Yeah.  

3:07 3:12 FEMALE: I've been there, like, more times than I would care to acknowledge, but I actually don't like it that much.

3:14 3:16 MALE: You don't like it?  Why is that?

3:13 3:19 FEMALE: Well, that's the funny thing.  Like, I'm more used to New York.  I mean, being in college at, at Yale for three years, we were in New York quite often.

3:22 3:23 MALE: Right.

3:20 3:26 FEMALE: And I also worked two summers in New York, so in terms of American cities, from what I've seen, New York was just so much more, I don't know.

3:30 3:31 MALE: Cosmopolitan or something?

3:28 3:30 FEMALE: Uh, no, San Francisco's cosmopolitan too.

3:33 3:34 MALE: Okay.

3:30 3:38 FEMALE: San Francisco actually had that pretty good too, but you know, like, in New York there are different sections, so every time you feel like you're sick of one type of culture or something--

3:40 3:41 MALE: Got more variety.

3:38 3:39 FEMALE: --you can hide away at something else, you know.

3:42 3:43 MALE: More diverse.

3:39 3:44 FEMALE: Yeah.  Exactly.  And so much to do.  I like music and theatre and--

3:45 3:48 MALE: Yeah, it's true, like Broadway.  

3:44 3:47 FEMALE: --ballet and that kind of crap, yeah, so.

3:49 3:51 MALE: We don't have anything like that in San Francisco, yeah.

3:48 3:51 FEMALE: Well, they have, but I've also not had time or money to go, or else, you know.

3:54 3:56 MALE: Right.  That's the trouble with being a student.

3:53 3:54 FEMALE: Last time I had money to burn, but now I'm like--

3:57 3:58 MALE: Yeah.  

3:55 3:56 FEMALE: Got to count every dollar, so.

3:59 4:02 MALE: Yeah, no that's, that's fair, you know, I hear a lot of people--

3:58 3:59 FEMALE: Do you go a lot, or--?

4:02 4:03 MALE: To what, plays?

4:00 4:01 FEMALE: Do you go a lot to the city?

4:04 4:09 MALE: Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Probably, probably every week.  At least.  Once or twice.

4:03 4:05 FEMALE: Okay.  Okay.  I thought it was [unintelligible].

4:10 4:13 MALE: I have a sister who lives in the city and uh another sister in Oakland, and uh.

4:11 4:12 FEMALE: Oh okay.

4:15 4:16 MALE: So I go there to hang out.

4:13 4:15 FEMALE: You said you were from Connecticut.

4:17 4:18 MALE: Yeah.  

4:14 4:16 FEMALE: But your sisters have all moved out?

4:18 4:25 MALE: We all moved out here, a lot of us did, and uh, you know, the one in the city has two kids, so uh, it's very--

4:22 4:26 FEMALE: She's not moving.

4:26 4:31 MALE: Lucky.  Well, they may move.  They may move.  You know, the city's not easy with kids, but.

4:31 4:32 FEMALE: That was what I thought when I lived in New York, but, you know, I think--

4:35 4:36 MALE: People do it, yeah.

4:33 4:37 FEMALE: As a young person, you know, if you have one child, you'll hang in there, 'cause it's such a nice place to be.

4:38 4:40 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  

4:37 4:42 FEMALE: So what about you?  What are your--after your PhD are you thinking of academics as a career or--?

4:45 4:50 MALE: Probably not.  I'd probably do research at a company, perhaps in the Bay Area.

4:47 4:51 FEMALE: I kind of--I actually don't know anybody who's in geophysics.  

4:52 4:53 MALE: Excuse me.

4:49 4:51 FEMALE: So, like, what companies are you guys looking at?

4:55 5:03 MALE: There's a small company uh right in this area that does uh um develops algorithms to process seismic data which goes down, reflection data.

5:00 5:04 FEMALE: We're not--just, just on a side note, San Fran's not going to get the earthquake anytime soon, right?

5:08 5:11 MALE: Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Well I don't know, I don't study earthquakes anyway, but.

5:09 5:10 FEMALE: Oh what, what do you study [unintelligible]?

5:13 5:18 MALE: Well I'm more of just a, you know, seismic imaging, [horn] you know, like, like uh sonograms, but of the Earth.

5:14 5:15 FEMALE: Oh.

5:19 5:20 MALE: You know what sonogram is, well we do it with the Earth.
 
5:18 5:20 FEMALE: That's cool.  Anyhow, it was nice to meet you.

5:23 5:25 MALE: Yeah, nice to meet you too, female230.

5:22 5:24 FEMALE: Luckily we get to sit down.
