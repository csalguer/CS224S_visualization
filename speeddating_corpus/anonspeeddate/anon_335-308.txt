0:00 0:06 FEMALE: [laughter].  male308 Cass.  Look what you roped me in to. 
0:08 0:10 MALE: Are you having fun?  How's it going?
0:07 0:12 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm having fun, although my buzz wore off, so now I'm kind of like, oh.
0:13 0:17 MALE: Oh, no. At this point, somebody comes around, you're like--
0:14 0:15 FEMALE: The real female335. 
0:17 0:18 MALE: Sorry, I'm no longer drunk. 
0:17 0:17 FEMALE: I know. 
0:18 0:21 MALE: Otherwise it would've been great, but--
0:18 0:29 FEMALE: Don't worry.  I haven't told anybody else that I tossed back a few, but I was just telling somebody the other day that--you probably don't remember.  Um, but you, you bought the alcohol for my 18th birthday.  Do you remember that?
0:32 0:34 MALE: Was this over the summer, uh, in [unintelligible]?
0:31 0:37 FEMALE: No, no, no.  It was, um, my sophomore year.  We went to Ernie's, and we talked to Shaboo [phonetic].  It was before he got married.
0:39 0:41 MALE: Oh, man, I love that guy. 
0:39 0:50 FEMALE: Yeah.  And I was just telling somebody because a friend of mine went there. It was her birthday. She just turned 21, and they, they didn't give her a present.  It was like, "Oh, my God."  I went for my 18th birthday, and they gave me a present. 
0:51 0:56 MALE: The place is going to seed.  Let's be clear. You know, I feel like--oh.
0:52 0:58 FEMALE: It is.  Yeah.   So I have decided in the few seconds, seconds that we are really [unintelligible] for each other. 
0:59 1:01 MALE: Should we have dinner tomorrow night?  What do you think?
0:59 1:01  FEMALE: I think so.  Oh, my gosh.  How great. 
1:01 1:05 MALE: Oh, you know.  Yeah, I'd say this whole thing worked out pretty well.
1:02 1:05 FEMALE: [unintelligible], we don't need you.  We're going on a date.  [laughter]. 
1:05 1:11 MALE: It's--yeah, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten. Um, but, I mean, is it kind of what you expected, or--
1:09 1:11 FEMALE: Yeah, it's fun.  I'm having a good time. 
1:14 1:15 MALE: Yeah, it's very cool.  I mean--
1:13 1:15 FEMALE: I mean, I just like meeting new people, and I like to talk, so--
1:17 1:26 MALE: Yeah, I mean, this whole thing is, like--I heard we were filling out forms.  I was like, "Oh, gees, now I have to apologize to female335 about this."  But, uh, it's--I think it's a really cool process [unintelligible].
1:23 1:26 FEMALE: Like, female335, unattractive.  [laughter].
1:28 1:30 MALE: [unintelligible], you know?
1:27 1:33 FEMALE: Aw. [laughter]  No, but it's fun.  It's always good to get out of the department.
1:34 1:40 MALE: At this won't even--this will--it won't even throw off the averages.  It'll just be right there with them. 
1:38 1:41 FEMALE: But I am, I'm going to say yes, I am going to give you my email address. 
1:43 1:44 MALE: Oh, yes, that's a good idea. 
1:43 1:46 FEMALE: Um, but how about you?  Is it everything you hoped for and more, male308?
1:48 1:59 MALE: Yeah, it's a good time.  Well, I though, for some reason, there was just going to be ten of each gender, so I thought, "Well, you know, the odds are there, right?"  I know the grad students here.  The probability says--but yeah, it's been fun.  Yeah, it's really cool.
1:58 1:58 FEMALE: That's good. 
2:00 2:04 MALE: And, you know, I'm at the stage where, like, I just took exams yesterday.  So what's in my life right now?
2:06 2:06 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:04 2:10 MALE: I could be cleaning my room, which is a disaster, or out meeting people.  It actually was a close call.  I'm not going to lie to you.
2:10 2:14 FEMALE: male308, you know, I really find it hard to believe your single.  We should find--we should remedy that. 
2:15 2:18 MALE: Well, only after we find Mr. female335, as we call him.
2:17 2:17 FEMALE: Mr. female335.
2:19 2:21 MALE: Listen, what are you doing, uh, next Thursday night?
2:21 2:22 FEMALE: That's a good question.  Oh, nothing, actually. 
2:24 2:36 MALE: Outstanding.  So here's what we're doing.  Um, Star Wars is opening up, and this is going to be the dorkiest conversation you've had all night, but it's really important.  Um, a bunch of people--do you remember Hyde Ci [phonetic] from under grad?
2:34 2:34 FEMALE: Yes, yeah. 
2:36 2:37 MALE: Do you remember Connie from under grad?
2:36 2:36 FEMALE: Yes.
2:38 2:40 MALE: So, you know, she's working in a law firm now. 
2:38 2:39 FEMALE: Right, right, right.
2:40 2:42 MALE: He's back doing MS and E. 
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: Right. 
2:42 2:44 MALE: Actually, that's right because we ran into each other the other night. 
2:42 2:43 FEMALE: We ran into them.  Right, right, right. 
2:44 2:50 MALE: Um, anyway, so then to my summer roommate Sonia who you may have met that night, too, but I don't know if you remember her. 
2:50 2:51 FEMALE: You were with two women.  I don't think I met them.
2:51 3:04 MALE: Um, oo, and two single law students.  I'm not setting you up.  I'm just saying they're going to be there.  Are going to go see Star Wars at 10:30 at the Metrion [phonetic].  I don't know if you have an early morning on Friday.  It is a long weekend.  I think it's, like--
3:02 3:06 FEMALE: Actually, I do.  You know, I'm going to Tahoe, and we're leaving at 6:00 a.m.
3:07 3:09 MALE: Oo.  Well, don't sleep.
3:07 3:09 FEMALE: It's for--yeah, I know, right. 
3:10 3:11 MALE: No, uh, who are you going to Tahoe with?
3:10 3:12 FEMALE: Well, I'm going up with the alumni association board. 
3:14 3:15 MALE: Oh, are you still on that?
3:14 3:14 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:16 3:18 MALE: What, are you a regular member, or are you, like, a grad student--
3:16 3:19 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm the grad student [unintelligible] member. 
3:20 3:21 MALE: Oh, that's really cool.
3:19 3:25 FEMALE: But I've been a member for the last--you know, now it's going to be two years.  They're letting me stay on one more year because I told them after that, I'm going to go on.
3:27 3:28 MALE: How come I didn't see you at the Stars [phonetic] conference?
3:27 3:32 FEMALE: Um, I was in Milwaukee.  I was speaking at a conference.  Yeah.  I was really bummed.  I wanted to be there. 
3:34 3:36 MALE: I'm pretty impressed.  A conference sounds pretty good.
3:35 3:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:36 3:39 MALE: It was okay.  This was my second one, and--
3:39 3:43 FEMALE: I went as a student once.  I think--oh, you were there that time.  We saw each other that time.  Yeah. 
3:46 3:55 MALE: That would've been--yeah, the only other one I've been to.  I didn't see you--there's some, you know, like, um--a couple people a year ahead of me.  You know, there's only one person there from my class, nameX [phonetic], and there--
3:55 3:55 FEMALE: Oh, I know the last name. 
3:56 3:58 MALE: There would've been one person from your class, but--
3:57 3:59 FEMALE: Um hm.  Yeah, male308 Thompkinson's [phonetic] there.  Can you imagine?
4:00 4:03 MALE: Yeah, she was there.  I met her mom, actually, who's really cool.
4:00 4:04 FEMALE: Yeah, her mom's the sweetest.  Do you know nameX [phonetic] was there, too?
4:06 4:11 MALE: You know, I know the name, but I don't know him.  I think he was, like, ASSU [phonetic] president my fresh--
4:10 4:11 FEMALE: Yeah. 
4:12 4:13 MALE: Or vice president or something.
4:11 4:17 FEMALE: he was the first--it must have been your freshman year.  He was the first, like--
4:16 4:21 MALE: Oh, my God. I have to give you more tens.  Hang on.  No, go on, go on, go on.  What were you saying?
4:18 4:24 FEMALE: He was--I'm going to call you, "Good friend, other."  Good old friend.  I won't call you old.  Good friend. 
4:23 4:26 MALE: Okay. Um--
4:25 4:31 FEMALE: He was the first ASSU president, like, lone ASSU president.  Before that, it was four presidents. 
4:32 4:35 MALE: Really? That was a big mistake. 
4:31 4:31 FEMALE: Yeah. 
4:35 4:36 MALE: [unintelligible] for one person. 
4:39 4:40 FEMALE: Was I flirtatious?  
  MALE: [unintelligible]
