2:29 2:30 MALE: Are you in the PhD program?

2:47 3:01 FEMALE: I'm in the masters program at the education school and um, but there are a lot of people who are doing the MBA but also a masters in education.  There's the joint program where they do both.  So we have a lot of interaction with those students.

2:44 2:44 MALE: I see.

3:02 3:07 FEMALE: But I didn't know that there was a PhD at the GSB until very recently.

2:50 2:54 MALE: Yeah, yeah, they do because they need professors.  Yeah, yeah.
