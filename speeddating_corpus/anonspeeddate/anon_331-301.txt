00:01 00:02 FEMALE: Hi.  female331.
00:03 00:04 MALE: male301.  Good to meet you.  
00:04 00:08 FEMALE: male301, good to meet you.  Do you know, like, someone up there or?  
00:08 00:11 MALE: Um, I met her one time.  I met her at the [unintelligible].  
00:12 00:15 FEMALE: Okay.  Because that's, that's who I know here from this [unintelligible].  It's, like, how did you find out about it?  
00:16 00:19 MALE: Actually, my other two friends are here.  They've heard about this kind of a study going on.  
00:19 00:20 FEMALE: With nameX?  
00:20 00:25 MALE: And then--no, not nameX.  Not nameX either, but my friends.  They've got, like, a slip in [unintelligible], whatever.
00:24 00:25 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  
00:25 00:28 MALE: And then, um, and then I heard about it.  I'm in the school of medicine so--
00:28 00:31 FEMALE: Okay.  That's--so you know the--are you first year or second year?  
00:32 00:35 MALE: I'm only a one-year program, the [unintelligible] program for the teacher education program.  
00:35 00:39 FEMALE: Are you going to, like, go out and teach right away then, or...where?  Like in the Bay area?  
00:39 00:40 MALE: In San Francisco.
00:40 00:42 FEMALE: Do you have a place already or are you kind of--
00:42 00:42 MALE: No, I'm looking for a place.  
00:43 00:44 FEMALE: How's that going now?  
00:45 00:46 MALE: It's tough to find places.  
00:46 00:47 FEMALE: Yeah, what's the market like?  
00:48 00:49 MALE: For houses or for jobs?
00:48 00:50 FEMALE: No, for--forget housing, yeah.  
00:49 00:50 MALE: I have a job.  
00:50 00:52 FEMALE: That's what I'm saying.  You have a job.  
00:53 00:56 MALE: Well, the teaching, teacher profession, everyone's looking for math teacher right now.    
00:56 01:02 FEMALE: Oh, you're a math teacher.  That's--okay.  But are you going to do, like, general subjects or is it just math, or you do high school?  
01:03 01:04 MALE: I'm going to do high school.  
01:03 01:05 FEMALE: And just math or?  
01:06 01:08 MALE: Well, just math and teach, like an advisory or something.  
01:06 01:07 FEMALE: Like anything else?  
01:09 01:11 MALE: Yeah.  No, there's a couple schools that do, like, math and science--
01:10 01:11 FEMALE: Right, right, right.  
01:12 01:13 MALE: But I was looking--I'm just going to be a math teacher.  
01:13 01:18 FEMALE: Just math.  So are you good at math?  I guess it's silly thing, but, like, do you--was that your favorite thing in high school or college or?
01:19 01:25 MALE: Um, it wasn't that my favorite thing [unintelligible], I mean, it's something--that's the thing.  It's something I'm kind of good at, but it was never my favorite.    
01:23 01:24 FEMALE: Yeah.  
01:25 01:28 MALE: I never really like doing all [unintelligible] and I never really got away, got into it, you know.  
01:28 01:29 FEMALE: So what do you want to, like, why teach it?  
01:31 01:35 MALE: Because I think it's something that's important and I feel like it's something that can be really interesting.  
01:34 01:37 FEMALE: So how would you change it, 'cause, like, I didn't really like math either, you know.  
01:39 01:43 MALE: So many people don't because it's taught, like, procedurally.  This is the way the Greeks did it and so--
01:42 01:43 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
01:45 02:00 MALE: And so it's not that interesting.  But if you do it, like, I feel you can do it like exploratory based, like problem solving based.  [unintelligible] a little bit, you have to train your brain to think about those things a little bit more and then make it, like, not hard and make it accessible.  But it can be really rewarding to, like, kind of discovery it on your own.  It's, like, you have ownership and feel like it makes sense, you know.  
01:59 02:11 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You see, I remember, like, I always did well at algebraic stuff.  That's, like, to me, easy, but geometry I did horribly at.  I didn't like the proofs.  Like, when we have to, like, proofing, so, like, I don't know.  They're, like, what would you do there?  
02:12 02:16 MALE: Well, I mean, like the thing, like, proofs are kind of [unintelligible].  
02:15 02:17 FEMALE: You make it so like it's not like, I hated that stuff.  
02:19 02:22 MALE: Yeah, like, I hated it too.  Geometry, proofs, no one does, like, the two column [unintelligible]--
02:21 02:23 FEMALE: Yes, that's what we did.  Yes.  Yes.  
02:24 02:31 MALE: That's not what mathematicians do.  That's not like how people, like, think and do things.  That's how, like, mathematicians do it, like, it's more like paragraphing, like you--
02:30 02:32 FEMALE: Ooh, that's much easier.  
02:33 02:38 MALE: It's much easier and it makes more sense, right?  Like, the formalizations stuff, that comes from [unintelligible] exact--
02:39 02:40 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Okay.  
02:42 02:45 MALE: But it doesn't have to be that way.  There's so much room in math do it different ways.    
02:44 03:02 FEMALE: Yeah.  Actually I like it better if it's, like, more like an English style, like paragraphs because--if they take the math and they translate it into words for me, I become--it's much easier for me to do.  You know, like, if you take a weird equation and say, okay, well, this is like--you make a sentence out of it.  Oh, okay.  Then I can kind of figure it out, you know.  
03:04 03:12 MALE: It's like a literacy issue.  That's the thing about, like, reading the symbols and really kind of understanding what they mean and where it's coming from and being willing to have a couple of different representations for one, like, symbol.    
03:11 03:12 FEMALE: Yeah.  
03:13 03:26 MALE: I have an intuitive understanding of what the equal signs [unintelligible].  But so many kids, like, they see the equal sign and looks like, you know, they grow up seeing that [unintelligible] equal and equals means do something.  It means, like, perform something.  And then when they get to algebra, where it's, like, balancing equations, it doesn't make any sense to them.  
03:24 03:28 FEMALE: Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  It's like why do I have to subtract this from this side or [unintelligible].
03:29 03:30 MALE: Yes, exactly.  
03:29 03:35 FEMALE: It's kind of trippy that the math formulas even work at all in real life, I mean, it just, you know, that's kind of--
03:36 03:40 MALE: You see, that's the thing.  It's because people are taught separate.  Here's this thing at the end of the work in real life.  
03:40 03:41 FEMALE: Because they don't have that connection at all.  
03:43 03:56 MALE:  You should be able to make connections between it.  I've seen so many videos of, like, little kids who are, like, um, who are like, do the--do, like, a subtraction problem on paper and they might do it wrong and make an error.  And then they, like, do it, like intuitively, like they'll take ten beans away from fifty beans, right?    
03:54 03:55 FEMALE: Five apples or--yeah, yeah, yeah.  
03:57 04:02 MALE: And they're, like, oh, I like-- well, I got an answer here but it must be wrong because it's not how I did it on paper.  
04:01 04:01 FEMALE: Oh, wow.  
04:02 04:05 MALE: So they trust like that the procedure because that's what they think math is.  
04:04 04:09 FEMALE: As opposed to, like, your actual thing with the beans.  [laughter]   Well, it was nice to meet you.  
04:10 04:11 MALE: Nice to meet you.
