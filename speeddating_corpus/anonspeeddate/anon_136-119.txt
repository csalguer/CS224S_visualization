0:05 0:07 MALE:  Oh, no problem.  Is this "P"?  
0:08 0:09 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  
0:09 0:09 MALE:  Are you "P"?  
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  I am "P"  
0:11 0:15 MALE:  Okay, I mean you have a name card, but I can't see it right now.  
0:15 0:15 FEMALE:  female136.  
0:15 0:16 MALE:  Nice to meet you female136.  
0:22 0:32 FEMALE:  I'm right there with you.  So, male119 it's really nice to meet you.  
0:31 0:33 MALE: Yeah, it's good to meet you.  Wow.  
0:33 0:35 FEMALE:  This is like a marathon.  
0:36 0:38 MALE:  I feel like I'm wearing down at the home stretch.  
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
0:40 0:42 MALE:  So, what do you do at Stanford?  
0:42 0:45 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.  This is my first year.  
0:45 0:46 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  How about you?  
0:46 0:47 MALE:  I'm in mechanical engineering.  
0:48 0:50 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  What are you focused on?  
0:50 0:57 MALE:  What do I focus on?  I actually look at the mechanics of biomaterials.  So, it's actually more specifically.  
0:57 1:00 FEMALE:  What [unintelligible] biomaterials?  
1:00 1:06 MALE:  So, biological materials for example.  So, I actually look at the mechanics at the very top layer of the skin.  
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:07 1:19 MALE:  So, it's very specific.  I never thought I would be doing it, but with as applications, for example, toward transdermal, jugular [unintelligible], anything you attach to the skin interacts with it mechanically like a Band-Aid for example or drug patches.  
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
1:20 1:32 MALE:  I don't really care about the technology as much.  We're just studying that sort of material.  So, it's definitely very--off beat I would say.  I never thought I would be studying it.  So.  
1:32 1:41 FEMALE:  It is, but I mean I can definitely see why it's really important given that like there are so many [unintelligible] that are being made into like [unintelligible].  
1:42 1:42 MALE:  Absolutely.  
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Medications, or--
1:44 1:49 MALE:  [interposing]  Pharmaceuticals, any sort of kind of drugs or what not definitely.  
1:50 1:57 FEMALE:  That's really cool.  It's interesting.  I've met so many engineering people like from different disciplines and [unintelligible].  
1:58 2:05 MALE:  Everybody does a lot of different stuff.  Right.  Well, do you have a focus yet, or are you sort of just getting your feet wet in law school right now?  
2:05 2:15 FEMALE:  I'm still sort of getting a feel for it, but I have a hunch that what I'm going to end up doing is public international law.  
2:15 2:15 MALE:  Okay.  
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  Working for a government.  
2:18 2:18 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  Or working for an international institution.  
2:21 2:21 MALE:  Okay.  
2:21 2:26 FEMALE:  It's really--it's what I love.  I was going to be a [unintelligible] before I came here.  
2:26 2:29 MALE:  And that changed a little bit?  Not too much?  
2:29 2:32 FEMALE:  Not really so far my intentions have kind of born it out, but--
2:32 2:36 MALE:  [interposing]  So what did you do before that, or what led you down this path?  I'm just curious.  
2:36 2:39 FEMALE:  Well, I worked for about five years before I came here.  
2:40 2:40 MALE:  Okay.  
2:41 2:47 FEMALE:  And for a good portion of that time I worked for a public affairs firm in DC doing like legislative advocacy work.  
2:48 2:48 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:48 2:50 FEMALE:  And then I worked for the State Department for a while.  
2:50 2:52 MALE:  Oh, you did, okay.  How was that?  
2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  I loved it. 
2:53 2:53 MALE:  You did?  
2:54 3:06 FEMALE:  I loved it.  It was a fascinating organization.  They tackle so many issues with just like--I mean the world is a big place, and there are tons of things going on every day.  
3:06 3:06 MALE:  Right.  
3:08 3:10 FEMALE:  The state department tries to fill what--
3:10 3:16 MALE:  [interposing]  A lot of that stuff, right.  Yeah, definitely.  So, are you from that area originally, or?  
3:16 3:17 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm from DC.  
3:17 3:21 MALE:  Oh you are, like DC, DC or Virginia, or Maryland?  
3:21 3:22 FEMALE:  Virginia, you're right.  
3:23 3:27 MALE:  Okay, I'm just wondering.  I know a lot of people from. 
3:25 3:26 FEMALE:  How about you?  
3:26 3:32 MALE:  I'm from LA, in LA though.  A lot of people are like I'm from LA, but they're from California somewhere. 
3:32 3:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, Orange County or something.  
3:35 3:37 MALE: People know where the OC is now.  
3:39 3:44 FEMALE:  That's why it came to mind.  So, how long have you been in [unintelligible]?  
3:44 3:53 MALE:  So, this is my fifth year in grad school, and I came straight from undergrad.  I did undergrad on the East Coast, and I came back out here.  I like it out here.  
3:53 3:53 FEMALE:  You're never going back.  
3:54 3:59 MALE:  I don't know.  Well, it's really nice out here.  I do a lot of cycling and stuff like that.  
3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah  
4:00 4:02 MALE:  It's pretty fun.  Do you do--what do you do outside of law school?  
4:02 4:05 FEMALE:  I actually do bicycling, running--
4:05 4:05 MALE:  [interposing] Oh, really?  
4:06 4:11 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] cycling.  
4:12 4:14 MALE:  Just for fun.  This is a great place to do that.
4:14 4:15 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you.
4:15 4:16 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
