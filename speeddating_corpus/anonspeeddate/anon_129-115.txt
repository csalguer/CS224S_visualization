FILE NAME: Male Speaker 115 -- Female Speaker 129


0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  All right,  
0:02 0:03 MALE:  Hi, I'm male115. 
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  I'm female129. Nice to meet you. 
0:04 0:05 MALE:  Hi, nice to meet you.  
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  How's your evening going?
0:07 0:10 MALE:  It's going pretty well.  I'm starting to feel a little bit tired now.  
0:13 0:15 FEMALE:  It was exhausting.  What's this--number fourteen?  
0:14 0:15 MALE:  Fourteen.  So we still--
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  [interposing]  We're getting there.  
0:16 0:17 MALE:  Five more, yeah. 
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  Are you having fun?  
0:18 0:20 MALE:  What letter are you, "I"?
0:23 0:26 FEMALE:  I am "I" yeah.  
0:24 0:27 MALE:  Good, good.  That sounds funny.
0:29 0:33 FEMALE:  I'm like I don't know.  I've just been waiting here all night, and you guys just come.  
0:34 0:36 MALE:  Well, it's so much easier for you.  You don't have to be moving around.  
0:39 0:41 FEMALE:  That's true.  So, what are you studying?
0:39 0:40 MALE:  I do physics.  
0:42 0:44 FEMALE:  Physics, oh my god.
0:42 0:45 MALE:  So you don't do science.  What do you do? 
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  Education.  
0:45 0:46 MALE:  Oh, education.  
0:48 0:53 FEMALE:  Actually, physics is like the academic subjects I am most scared of.  
0:52 0:52 MALE:  Oh, why is that?
0:55 1:03 FEMALE:  Because my physics teacher in high school sat me down one day and told me that there were two kinds of people in the world, people who are good at physics and people who aren't, and that I wasn't.  
1:02 1:03 MALE:  Oh, my god. 
1:05 1:08 FEMALE:  I had been working my tail off.  I just didn't get it.  
1:06 1:08 MALE:  Oh my god, that's tough.  
1:10 1:15 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] like what shape is this?  I don't know.  It's [unintelligible].  It's a parabala.  
1:15 1:19 MALE:  Oh, my god that person [unintelligible] right from the teacher, you know, doing that. 
1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  You know--but you know what god bless him.  
1:21 1:22 MALE:  Oh really.
1:24 1:31 FEMALE:  Because I wasn't any good at it, and I was being way too hard on myself and I needed to just sort of say like it's okay to not be good at it.  
1:29 1:33 MALE:  Okay, yeah.  Okay, I'm glad you have a good impression about that.  
1:35 1:38 FEMALE:  Yes, yes, it didn't bother me so much.  
1:37 1:37 MALE:  Okay, that's good.  That's very good.  
1:39 1:39 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:38 1:38 MALE: So are you first year?
1:42 1:43 FEMALE: First and only year. 
1:42 1:44 MALE: Oh, okay, okay, so you are in the Master's program? 
1:46 1:46 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:44 1:44 MALE: Okay. 
1:47 1:50 FEMALE: The one-year Master's, nine months actually.  
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Uh-huh, wow.  
1:52 1:53 FEMALE: Very quick.  
1:51 1:56 MALE:  I know.  Everything is so quick here--speed dating, the quarters.  
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  Okay, where are you from?
1:58 1:59 MALE: I come from Spain.  
2:01 2:03 FEMALE: From Spain? And things are much slower in Spain?
2:02 2:04 MALE: Much more slower, yeah.  
2:07 2:10 FEMALE: Everybody takes it easy, and in America it's much faster.  
2:08 2:19 MALE:  Yeah, absolutely.  When I go back for vacation, the first few days I feel stressed out, and I look at people and they say--and then I think to myself they're so inefficient.  They do everything so slowly.  
2:21 2:21 FEMALE: That's funny.  
2:20 2:24 MALE: Yeah, really, and then like a few days later I'm one--I go back to what I was before.  
2:27 2:30 FEMALE: Yeah.  How long have you been here?
2:28 2:29 MALE:  Four and a half years.
2:31 2:34 FEMALE: So, what do you think, are you going to stay or go home?
2:32 2:32 MALE: I have no clue.  
2:35 2:35 FEMALE: Really?  
2:32 2:49 MALE:  I have no clue.  What I believe is that if I stay here for whatever reason, that will mean that I am better off here than there.  So that will be good, and if I do the opposite, same thing.  That's because I will be treated better there.  So, whatever I do will be the best I guess.  
2:52 2:55 FEMALE: I've asked that.  It all works out in the end, right?
2:53 2:54 MALE:  Exactly.  
2:56 3:09 FEMALE: It all happens for a reason.  I just wish that somebody else controlled the outcome sometimes.  It's a lot of pressure when you have to make these decisions for yourself where you're going to live.  
3:07 3:12 MALE: I know.  Actually--yeah, I can understand that about you because since you are going to finish your program now.  Are you stressed about that? 
3:15 3:19 FEMALE:  I'm not stressed about finishing.  I'm stressed about figuring out where I'm going next.  
3:17 3:20 MALE: Oh, that's what I meant.  
3:22 3:24 FEMALE:  I really shouldn't stress about it because--
3:22 3:28 MALE:  [interposing] Well, actually yes because what I mean is that you have to move somewhere, right?  I mean you have to do it.  
3:30 3:31 FEMALE: Well, so I just moved here from Boston.  
3:29 3:30 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:32 3:34 FEMALE:  And I'm glad that I did, but I'm--
3:33 3:33 MALE: Why is that?
3:36 3:37 FEMALE: What's that?
3:35 3:36 MALE:  Why, exactly?  
3:38 3:41 FEMALE:  Why am I glad that I did? It was a change.  
3:39 3:39 MALE: Okay.  
3:42 3:46 FEMALE: An experience, and I have a sister in Boston and a sister in San Francisco.  
3:44 3:45 MALE: Uh-huh.  
3:47 3:57 FEMALE: My sister out here has kids.  So, it's been really nice to keep her kids and sort of, you know--I don't know, it's been great.  But now it's like do I go back to the East Coast?  Do I stay here?  What do I do?  
3:56 3:56 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  It's a lot of pressure.  
3:58 4:00 MALE: Yeah, but you know nothing is irreversible.  
4:03 4:06 FEMALE: That's true.  That's what I said when I moved out here.
4:05 4:06 MALE:  Exactly. 
4:08 4:08 FEMALE: Like--
4:07 4:10 MALE: [interposing] So at least now you know [unintelligible] have to move?
4:15 4:17 FEMALE: Oh, my goodness.  male115, I didn't even--
4:14 4:15 MALE: [interposing]  Oh, very interesting.  
4:18 4:20 FEMALE:  It was nice to meet you.  Have fun.  Good luck.
4:17 4:18 MALE: You too.
