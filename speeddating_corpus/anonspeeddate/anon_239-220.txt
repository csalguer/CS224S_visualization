0:52 0:56 FEMALE:  Exactly, I, that's nice.  I'm in the product design program, master's degree; it's in the department of mechanical engineering.
0:57 0:58 MALE:  Okay.
0:57 1:00 FEMALE:  And it's a two year program, my first year, I'll graduate next year.  You?
1:01 1:12 MALE:  Okay, so, I'm in electrical engineering, I'm in my sixth year.  I'll graduate in probably December or March.  Um, and uh, yeah, I'm in to like ultra sound imaging.
1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  Cool, okay.
1:13 1:14 MALE:  So, yeah.
1:15 1:18 FEMALE: Are you going to try and be a professor or do more research here?
1:17 1:31 MALE:  No, I'm going to probably do like post doc or something.  I, right now I'm sort of on the engineering end of um, engineering end of things, so I want to do um, yeah, I want to do.  I'm not sure; I think I want to do something more medical, medical oriented.
1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:32 1:35 MALE:  So, maybe do post doc like in medical school or something.
1:35 1:37 FEMALE:  Oh, great.  Well good luck.
1:37 1:39 MALE:  Or, or just go work for a small company or something.
1:39 1:41 FEMALE:  That's cool, that's cool.  Yeah.
1:41 1:43 MALE:  So like what, what specifically is your research about?
1:44 1:49 FEMALE:  Oh, well see, mine's not really a research program, it's very, it's just a product design program so all we do is make fun products all the time.
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Oh, okay.
1:50 1:58 FEMALE:  But I do want to do some research in the field of, see I draw, I draw comics a lot and I want to research the effectiveness of the comic medium on higher education.
1:59 2:00 MALE:  Cool, wow, that's pretty awesome.
2:00 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, see if, so see if like, you know, there's all these books for kids that are like, oh let's learn physics and it's rudimentary, but if you really bring it to like, higher education, you know, it's also very useful.  And I don't think enough is done to help um, current education materials of higher ed, you know.  It's all like textbooks and like, you know, boring stuff [laughter].
2:25 2:29 MALE:  Cool, so, are you, like you're doing like comic strips or like comic books like?
2:29 2:33 FEMALE:  I do both, right, I um, I used to, I drawing from like years and year, ten years or more.
2:34 2:37 MALE:  Oh, that's really cool, so that, that, what kind of comics do you like, like what kind of?
2:37 2:39 FEMALE:  Um let's see, so my strips are...
2:40 2:42 MALE:  Do you write, do you do the daily, or?
2:42 3:06 FEMALE:  I used to, mainly political comics and stuff, when the Galician was around; oh I would spurt them out.  Now I'm just really busy, um.  But I used to do like a strip that I'm particularly fond of is these two super heroes named Vector and Scalor.  And they uh, they battle the evils of like science puns.  And I use these characters to help.  I was a TA for a mechanics course last fall and I used them as my supplemental handouts for my students.  And it really, I think it really helped.
3:07 3:09 MALE:  Cool, no, that's pretty, man, that's totally unique, right?
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, tell me something unique about you?  What are you, what are you like to do?
3:12 3:29 MALE:  Uh, what's unique about me?  Um, I'm doing a lot of different stuff.  So I mean I like to snowboard and do a lot of outdoor stuff uh, running and um.  Yeah, I like to read a lot.  And uh, yeah, I'm into, yeah I'm into that kind of stuff I guess.
3:30 3:34 FEMALE:  That's great, that's great you get to get out and do some things around here.
3:35 3:37 MALE:  Uh, yeah, I, you know, I like to go hiking I guess.
3:37 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, what's a good trail you recommend around here?
3:40 3:50 MALE:  Recommended trail?  Uh, I mean if you want to go someplace close, I guess, uh, oh, there's Big Basin, I think so.  It's like a couple of hours from here, it's pretty nice.
3:50 3:51 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah?
3:51 3:57 MALE:  But it's like uh, nice redwoods and waterfalls and stuff like that.  Point Rains is also really nice, couple of hours from here.
3:57 4:04 FEMALE:  Okay, that's sweet.  That'd be cool.  I guess you've been around the area to know the things, pretty, pretty good and so far huh?
4:02 4:05 MALE:  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean there's always somebody who knows more.
4:06 4:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, is that the last one?
