0:18 0:21 MALE:  Yeah, it's a good experience.  I've never done this before so.

0:22 0:24 FEMALE:  I'm--I'm right there with you as well, so.

0:24 0:25 MALE:  Yeah, I figured why not.

0:26 0:29 FEMALE:  A--a good attitude to have.  A good attitude.  What program are you in?

0:29 0:30 MALE:  I'm in engineering.

0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  Okay.

0:31 0:31 MALE:  It's, uh--

0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  Very good.  Electrical?

0:33 0:33 MALE:  No, materials.

0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  Oh, branching out.

0:35 0:36 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:36 0:44 FEMALE:  Well I've--I've met a lot of the electrical engineers that they said if you meet an engineer most likely it's an electrical engineer, so I--I--the theory proved wrong.

0:45 0:46 MALE:  Yeah.  [laughter]

0:46 0:49 FEMALE:  Because you're not an electrical engineer.  Oh well.  [laughter]

0:49 0:50 MALE:  Where you from?

0:50 1:02 FEMALE:  Um, I'm from upstate New York via Scotland and Boston.  We kind of started out in the state of New York, then spent some time in Scotland, then spent some time in Boston and now here.

1:02 1:02 MALE:  Okay.

1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  So, well what about you?

1:04 1:06 MALE:  Um, I grew up in [unintelligible].

1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Oh.

1:07 1:07 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:08 1:11 FEMALE:  Big--just across the [unintelligible] Bridge?  [laughter]

1:11 1:12 MALE:  Pretty much, Yeah.

1:13 1:16 FEMALE:  Very cool.  Have you--did you stay around here for college and everything like that?

1:15 1:16 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:17 1:19 FEMALE:  You went to Stanford undergrad?  Okay.  When did you graduate?

1:20 1:20 MALE:  2000.

1:20 1:33 FEMALE:  Okay.  Because I knew--I know through my various pursuits I've actually met a lot of alums, so, um, I know a lot of runners and, um, who actually--no.

1:34 1:35 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:35 1:37 FEMALE:  Yes, uh-huh.  Did you know anyone--do you know any runners or?

1:38 1:40 MALE:  I knew the people on the track team [unintelligible] 

1:41 1:46 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It just kind of varies pretty much through running.  Yeah, because that's what I do.  [laughter]

1:46 1:46 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:47 1:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, I run for a team in San Francisco, so.

1:51 1:55 MALE:  Well one of my, um, one of my good friends, um, he, uh, he's ran a marathon at Boston.

1:56 1:56 FEMALE:  How'd he do?

1:57 1:57 MALE:  He did very well.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  I was actually there this weekend.

1:59 2:01 MALE:  Yeah, he did it.  He did it--he said he did it in, uh, three hours.

2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  That's great.

2:03 2:03 MALE:  And [unintelligible] or something.

2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  No, that's very good.

2:05 2:05 MALE:  But yeah--

2:05 2:06 FEMALE:  How's he doing now?

2:07 2:10 MALE:  He's doing fine.  [unintelligible] got back [unintelligible] 

2:10 2:10 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:10 2:12 MALE:  So we all went out [unintelligible] 

2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  Oh, very good.

2:13 2:14 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:15 2:22 FEMALE:  No, that's fabulous.  It was--it was a tough day.  I was--I unfortunately had to fly back the day of the marathon so I didn't get to watch it.

2:23 2:23 MALE:  Okay.

2:24 2:30 FEMALE:  But, um, just--I had a lot of friends who did it.  And so just calling and emailing and getting reports it was a hot day.

2:31 2:35 MALE:  Yeah.  I can't imagine like running [unintelligible] 

2:36 2:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And [unintelligible] 

2:40 2:44 MALE:  He was telling me that some people did it like [unintelligible] six hours [unintelligible] 

2:46 2:48 FEMALE:  I--I don't think--

2:48 2:49 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:50 2:57 FEMALE:  No, you walk run.  I mean because you have to think if you run a marathon in about three hours, that's about a seven minute pace.

2:58 2:58 MALE:  Yeah.

2:58 3:08 FEMALE:  And so if you do it in twice that it's about a 14-minute pace.  So that's kind of--I mean most people can walk a mile in about 15 minutes if they're walking pretty steadily.

3:08 3:08 MALE:  Uh-huh.

3:08 3:12 FEMALE:  And so yeah, that's kind of essentially a very, very, very slow jog or a very brisk walk.

3:13 3:13 MALE:  Yeah.

3:14 3:20 FEMALE:  I just--I--I can't--if I were going to do it, I--I would not want to walk it.  I'd want to get it done as quickly as I could.

3:21 3:23 MALE:  Three hours doesn't sound that quick [unintelligible] 

3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, but the fast people do it just over two.

3:27 3:31 MALE:  Yeah, he told me [unintelligible] 

3:32 3:40 FEMALE:  Yeah, pretty much.  [laughter]  Well very cool.  So--so what--what are you studying then in your degree?

3:41 3:42 MALE:  [unintelligible] materials.

3:44 3:47 FEMALE:  Very cool.  You get to play with--

3:47 3:48 MALE:  Play with magnets.

3:48 3:48 FEMALE:  Very cool.

3:48 3:49 MALE:  Uh, sometimes.

3:49 3:53 FEMALE:  [laughter] [unintelligible] school of education so--

3:53 3:53 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:54 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, I haven't been in physics for a while so I'm like, I know magnets is much broader than like--but--

3:59 4:00 MALE:  [unintelligible] refrigerator magnets.

4:00 4:04 FEMALE:  Exactly.  But they're still fun to play with.  But anyway, well very cool.  Well it was great meeting you.

4:05 4:05 MALE:  [unintelligible] meet you too.

4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Have fun.

4:06 4:06 MALE:  You too.
