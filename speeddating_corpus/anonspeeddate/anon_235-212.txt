0:12 0:17 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] I feel like [unintelligible] has like everyone [unintelligible] over at our place.  

0:20 0:20 MALE:  Well not me.  

0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  Okay there's still time left.  

0:23 0:26 MALE:  Yeah.  Hey I heard she does good cooking actually, like she's been all over New York.  

0:24 0:34 FEMALE:  Oh she does amazing cooking of all kinds, like entrees, desserts, like she always has something, like meals, like dessert.  Oh, it's great living with her [laughter].  So -- 

0:37 0:39 MALE:  Yeah I'm actually in a French pastry class --  

0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  Are you serious?  

0:40 0:40 MALE:  -- this semester.  

0:38 0:40 FEMALE:  Like where do you go for that?  

0:42 0:50 MALE:  Like there's a French dorm on campus, it's on like Mayfield Avenue and so like every Thursday evening they have like a wine tasting classes, huge cooking classes.  

0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  Oh really.  

0:51 0:53 MALE:  And it's pretty cool.  Are you going to be here for another year?  

0:51 0:57 FEMALE:  No, I'm almost done, too bad.  I love cooking, I love drinking.  That would have been great.  

0:59 1:00 MALE:  Combine the both.  So what program are you in then again?  

0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  I'm in education.  I'm in the Masters program.  

1:03 1:03 MALE:  Oh okay.  

1:02 1:07 FEMALE:  I'm almost done.  No, so I'm really hung up on your food right now.  

1:09 1:10 MALE:  Oh yeah.  

1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  So how long have you been in the class?  

1:11 1:24 MALE:  Actually just since the spring quarter.  You can register in all the different times, but I found out about it, had some spare time and so every other Thursday we cook from like 8:30 'til midnight, which it's cool, but --  

1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  That's amazing.  

1:25 1:33 MALE:  My only fault with it, you're like pulling out your cookies and stuff and your quiche at like midnight and I'm not really that really that hungry at that time of night.  

1:32 1:34 FEMALE:  Some people are, besides [unintelligible].  

1:36 1:39 MALE:  Well you'll just have to give me your phone number and we can make a delivery or something.  

1:37 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah home delivery.  No--  

1:42 1:49 MALE:  It's cool, we made like some macaroons, we made quiche and you know the truffles you buy in candy stores?  

1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Yes, you made truffles?  

1:50 1:51 MALE:  We made those.  

1:49 1:52 FEMALE:  I heard it takes a long time to make truffles is that true?  It was chocolate truffles right?  

1:54 1:56 MALE:  Actually it was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be, like --  

1:54 1:55 FEMALE:  Oh really.  

1:57 2:01 MALE:  You just sort of make this like ganache of some sort of chocolate thing and then just roll it up into a ball.  

2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  Oh my God.  

2:03 2:11 MALE:  So, it was pretty cool, but my main problem with all of the stuff we do is like the ingredients you have and the batch size is so high that you're like -- we made like 150 truffles in our batch.  

2:10 2:12 FEMALE:  Are you serious?  You could sell them.  

2:15 2:16 MALE:  I know, I'm considering it.  

2:14 2:16 FEMALE:  Just set a little table in [unintelligible].  

2:18 2:23 MALE:  We got like a 20 pound bar of Ghiradelli chocolate from like Trader Joe's.  

2:20 2:22 FEMALE:  Why were they so big?  I'm just like --  

2:24 2:26 MALE:  Well I guess there's like 30 people in the class.  

2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  Okay.	  

2:27 2:30 MALE:  So I guess the recipe is just for a large batch or something.  Yeah it's cool.  

2:27 2:31 FEMALE:  Okay.  Okay.  Did you -- were you like a big cooker before, like baker, cooker?  

2:33 2:48 MALE:  A little bit, actually like since I came you know to the graduate life I've cooked a lot more on my own, you know, sort of range from, you know, the small things.  So I'm getting more adventurous now with my fish and my trusty George Foreman Grill.  So do you cook as well?  

2:47 3:09 FEMALE:  I cook.  I mean, I feel like when [unintelligible] every day for three times a day it's not as fun anymore, but like I do enjoy it.  Like, it's kind of like maybe I'm more of a baker just because I have a sweet tooth and so I like to eat what I bake.  My main motivation for baking, so -- well I think this past week I think I've baked at like midnight.  I was like at one o'clock like cookies at midnight.  I think it's a procrastination tactic.  

3:11 3:11 MALE:  Yeah.  

3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  But I think it benefits many people, so I say it's okay.  

3:14 3:18 MALE:  Yeah and you're like in the long-term you have like, you know, your food that you can eat.  

3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  Exactly.  

3:19 3:22 MALE:  And one year working so you can work better and you work more productively.  

3:21 3:23 FEMALE:  That's what I say, it's a projective procrastination.  

3:24 3:31 MALE:  I'm still in the process of learning my family's fudge recipe, which is sort of like amazing.  

3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Oh you have one?   

3:32 3:32 MALE:  Yes.  

3:30 3:33 FEMALE:  I'm so jealous, I wish I had one of those.  I don't.  

3:35 3:37 MALE:  Well now is the time to start so you know like --  

3:35 3:35 FEMALE:  I -- yeah.  

3:37 3:38 MALE:  -- future generations.  

3:36 3:43 FEMALE:  I'll just start my own right?  You're right.  So like, is there like a secret ingredient to your fudge recipe?  

3:45 3:54 MALE:  Not really, I guess it's just you know, a lot of butter and a lot of chocolate and nuts.  I'd really like to learn how to make walnut fudge or like maple fudge.  

3:53 3:53 FEMALE:  Oh.  

3:55 3:57 MALE:  Like sort blonde fudge, you know, go with my hair, but --  

3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  Right.  Right, coordinate.  

4:00 4:00 MALE:  Yeah.  

3:59 4:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Well we spent the whole time talking about food.  

4:05 4:05 MALE:  All right, well it was a pleasure talking cooking with you.  

4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  I know, it was nice meeting.  

4:07 4:10 MALE:  Maybe I'll stop by maybe some time and we'll have some tasty treats.  

4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  All right, I'll see you later.  

4:11 4:12 MALE:  Take care.
