0:00 0:01 FEMALE: [horn] Oh Jesus. 
0:01 0:02 MALE: That was too fast for you.
0:03 0:11 FEMALE: Oh God. Sorry. I'm female323.
0:11 0:12 MALE: Let me guess your name because...
0:13 0:13 FEMALE: Oh.
0:13 0:14 MALE: I'm nameX.	
0:14 0:14 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, nameX.
0:14 0:15 MALE: Which department are you in?
0:16 0:17 FEMALE: I'm in the STEP program here in the School of Ed.
0:18 0:19 MALE: What's that stand for?
0:20 0:21 FEMALE: Stanford Teacher Education Program.
0:22 0:23 MALE: Okay. So what kind of teacher are you going to be?
0:24 0:25 FEMALE: A high school math teacher.
0:25 0:28 MALE: Okay. Nice. So have you gotten a job already here?
0:28 0:28 FEMALE: Yes.
0:28 0:28 MALE: Oh. Congratulations.
0:29 0:36 FEMALE: Thank you. High school math teachers, we get jobs pretty easily because no one wants to do it.
0:36 0:38 MALE: Oh. Math is the best thing to teach in high school, I think.
0:39 0:39 FEMALE: I think so, too.
0:40 0:47 MALE: It's like the most portable for example, you can take it anywhere. Social studies you have to relearn if you went to Canada for example. And then we're the bad guys.
0:48 0:51 FEMALE: [laughter] That's true. We got everything you never knew.
0:52 0:53 MALE: So where are you going to be teaching?
0:54 0:55 FEMALE: At San Lorenzo High School?
0:56 0:58 MALE: In northern California. No. I don't know where that is.
0:59 1:02 FEMALE: It's highway 92. It's right off highway 92 on the east side of the Bay.
1:02 1:03 MALE: Okay. Are you a California native?
1:04 1:05 FEMALE: No. I grew up in the northeast. I grew up in New Jersey.
1:05 1:07 MALE: Me, too. Well I grew up in Long Island, the Tri-state area.
1:08 1:08 FEMALE: Where in Long Island?
1:09 1:14 MALE: Plainview, Nassau County. You know I come from New York. I can come back but.
1:15 1:18 FEMALE: How long have you been out here?	
1:19 1:20 MALE: Since '97, I was a freshman here so I just stayed all the way through.
1:21 1:23 FEMALE: You stayed? So you haven't left Stanford yet?	
1:24 1:26 MALE: Yeah. I graduate this year in December.
1:26 1:27 FEMALE: Okay. So what are you studying?
1:27 1:27 MALE: Electrical engineering.
1:28 1:28 FEMALE: So you're getting an MA?
1:29 1:30 MALE: No. Do you know what bio--ex is?
1:31 1:31 FEMALE: No.
1:32 1:34 MALE: I'm getting my PhD this year.
1:35 1:37 FEMALE: So you started in '97.
1:38 1:41 MALE: So freshman in '97, graduated in 2000 and 2005 PhD.
1:42 1:47 FEMALE: Wow. Okay. I graduate from college also in 2000, but I don't have a PhD.
1:48 1:52 MALE: But if you're as stupid as me. All my friends are making money, my brother's on Wall Street.
1:52 1:53 FEMALE: I'm not making any money either.
1:53 1:55 MALE: Well but, you know,
1:56 1:57 FEMALE: No, I think it's great. What is your PhD in?
1:58 2:07 MALE: Electrical engineering, technically but it's like CS in the 70s. There's a lot of people who jumped into it from other fields so I'm doing really biology, genomix, genetic circuits. So that's why double [unintelligible]
2:09 2:11 FEMALE: Okay. So what kind of job do you want to get?
2:12 2:14 MALE: Hopefully faculty.
2:15 2:15 FEMALE: Oh teaching?
2:15 2:24 MALE: Yeah, right. So I'm going to actually MIT tomorrow. Someone talked me into coming here so I come in here and [unintelligible] talk to someone.
2:25 2:27 FEMALE: So you want to stay in academia?
2:28 2:30 MALE: Yeah, forever. No real world for me, right?
2:31 2:32 FEMALE: Perpetually summers off.
2:33 2:33 MALE: That's nice.
2:34 2:36 FEMALE: That's nice. So how does that work? Do you start off as an associate professor and then...?
2:37 2:55 MALE: You start as an assitant and then as you get tenure it's an associate. But actually I'm less interested in teaching, I want to do research. Not that I'm against teaching, but I like making big computers and making things rotate around, that sort of thing.
2:55 2:58 FEMALE: So I guess universities are the best places to do research, right?
2:59 3:01 MALE: Yeah, exactly. Where did you? Did you say where you went to undergrad?
3:02 3:03 FEMALE: I went to Carnegie Melon undergrad.
3:03 3:06 MALE: Oh, okay. You graduated in 2000? You didn't know a kid named nameX [phonetic] did you?
3:07 3:07 FEMALE: Who?
3:08 3:10 MALE: nameX. He's a tall, gangly kid on the swim team.
3:10 3:10 FEMALE: I don't think so.
3:11 3:15 MALE: He's from my high school. I just know he went there.
3:16 3:20 FEMALE: I might. The name doesn't sound totally unfamiliar but I can't picture who he is.
3:20 3:22 MALE: There's a lot of Long Island kids over there.
3:22 3:25 FEMALE: I know. It's like everyone from New Jersey and Long Island just ended up there.
3:26 3:29 MALE: The weather there. Here it must be much nicer, right? I hear--
3:29 3:29 FEMALE: Than Pittsburgh?
3:30 3:30 MALE: Yeah.
3:30 3:31 FEMALE: Yes. [laughter]
3:31 3:32 MALE: I hear it's very rainy, right?
3:33 3:42 FEMALE: It doesn't even rain just sort of mist. It's like a water pump in front of a fan. It's like this weird misty.
3:43 3:48 MALE: Is that the place where they have that-- no that's Case Western. They built this building where--
3:48 3:50 FEMALE: Yeah, the sun with the blind shades.
3:51 3:52 MALE: Yeah, yeah. You know it. Okay.
3:52 3:54 FEMALE: Carnegie Melon is very similar to Case Western.
3:55 3:56 MALE: They're very close, right?
3:56 3:59 FEMALE: Right, but it's in Cleveland. I think Case is in Cleveland.
4:00 4:03 MALE: Right. There must be some collaboration. Are they rivals or something?
4:04 4:19 FEMALE: They're not that close, they're not close enough to be rivals. But Case is just like the same kind of bunch of engineers. Anyway it was nice to meet you, nameX. Good luck on your interview tomorrow.
4:22 4:22 MALE: Thanks.
