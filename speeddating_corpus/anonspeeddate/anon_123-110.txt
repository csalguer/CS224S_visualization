0:00:01.6 0:00:02.1 MALE:  Hey.
0:00:02.2 0:00:03.0 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:00:03.1 0:00:03.7 MALE:  I'm male110.
0:00:04.4 0:00:05.4 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:00:04.3 0:00:05.3 MALE:  Nice to meet you too. 
0:00:07.3 0:00:09.6 FEMALE:  Could you write your name down for future references?
0:00:07.5 0:00:10.9 MALE:  Um, sure.  There it is. [laughter]. 
0:00:11.0 0:00:12.4 FEMALE:  How'd you get named after a city?
0:00:11.9 0:00:19.1 MALE:  Uh, pardon me?  Oh, okay.  So yeah, it's actually, male110's, um, the- it could be a Yugoslav or Czechoslovakian name.
0:00:20.1 0:00:20.7 FEMALE:  Oh.
0:00:20.0 0:00:26.2 MALE:  So it's- oh it's not an Italian name at all.  And I'm, I'm from Serbia.  That's where I grew up.  I lived in Belgrade for about twenty years or so.  
0:00:26.9 0:00:27.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:26.6 0:00:31.5 MALE:  Came to California, lived in New Jersey, came back to California and that's about it.  [laughter] 
0:00:31.7 0:00:36.5 FEMALE:  Okay, so there's definitely an explanatory gap there.  How do you go from California to New Jersey?
0:00:35.2 0:00:38.6 MALE:  [laughter] You [unintelligible].
0:00:37.9 0:00:39.7 FEMALE:  I mean, I can understand the coming back-
0:00:39.0 0:00:39.5 MALE:  Right.
0:00:39.6 0:00:40.8 FEMALE:  -but how did you, uh--
0:00:40.1 0:00:45.2 MALE:  No, it's, uh, actually I never lived on the East Coast, so I had [unintelligible] just to check out the East Coast.
0:00:45.4 0:00:45.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:45.0 0:00:48.1 MALE:  And then I eventually came back to California.  Because I- I liked it here better.
0:00:49.2 0:00:54.7 FEMALE:  How come you didn't end up in New York, though?  I mean, it seems like the more natural place to end up if you go to the East Coast is New York City.
0:00:53.2 0:01:10.4 MALE:  I love New York.  I really liked it a lot.  But at some point, um, I think it's really like the age factor.  If you can live in New York- you know, I'm- I'm twenty-nine right now, so, like, eventually in the long run, New York is- you know, it's not really like a friendly, family oriented place.  Um- 
0:01:11.5 0:01:12.0 FEMALE:  That's true.
0:01:11.1 0:01:15.0 MALE:  It's- it's great for partying, though, like if you like clubbing and all that kind of stuff like. 
0:01:15.2 0:01:15.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:15.5 0:01:17.7 MALE:  Do you go out a lot or [unintelligible]?
0:01:18.2 0:01:21.1 FEMALE:  Um, I probably go out two or three times a week.
0:01:20.4 0:01:23.7 MALE:  Yeah?  Where- where about?  Whe- where are some of your favorite places?
0:01:23.4 0:01:26.1 FEMALE:  Um, I usually go up once in the city-
0:01:25.6 0:01:26.1 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:26.3 0:01:28.8 FEMALE:  -and then we usually some- somewhere around here.
0:01:28.1 0:01:28.6 MALE:  Right.
0:01:28.7 0:01:30.5 FEMALE:  Uh, usually two nights I'm around here.  
0:01:29.7 0:01:30.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:30.8 0:01:33.4 FEMALE:  Um, so I'm in law school, and every week they have bar review.
0:01:33.4 0:01:34.9 MALE:  Yeah, I heard about that.  Right.
0:01:35.7 0:01:36.5 FEMALE:  Oh, how do you hear about it?
0:01:36.0 0:01:39.2 MALE:  Um, we have something similar called FOAM.  I'm in the business school.
0:01:40.2 0:01:41.1 FEMALE:  Oh, what do you guys have?
0:01:40.4 0:01:43.7 MALE:  Uh, FOAM, it's, uh- foam like foam.
0:01:44.5 0:01:45.0 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:44.4 0:01:53.8 MALE:  Uh, it's, uh, the abbreviation is, um, the acronym for friends of R. J. nameX, and R.J. nameX was the Dean of Stanford Business School a long time ago.  
0:01:53.5 0:01:54.1 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:54.3 0:02:04.9 MALE:  And, uh, the way it goes, the maiden name of this that R. J. Millers are basically the top ten percent of the students in the class.  And everybody else [unintelligible] [laughter] 
0:02:04.9 0:02:06.8 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:02:05.6 0:02:08.8 MALE:  And so FOAM is like a big, big, drinking event.
0:02:09.8 0:02:10.8 FEMALE:  Oh, I see.
0:02:10.0 0:02:12.9 MALE:  But I'm interested to know what, uh- what the bar review is like.
0:02:10.5 0:02:15.4 FEMALE:  Uh, the bar review?
0:02:14.0 0:02:16.0 MALE:  The bar review, right [laughter].
0:02:15.9 0:02:20.0 FEMALE:  I mean, it's just every Thursday night.  So I think we'll be hitting it up after this.  
0:02:19.1 0:02:19.6 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:19.7 0:02:21.7 FEMALE:  Um, they just pick a different bar.
0:02:21.0 0:02:21.5 MALE:  Right.
0:02:21.9 0:02:25.7 FEMALE:  And everyone just goes and gets [unintelligible].  And after a while, you see like the same one- like-
0:02:24.8 0:02:26.0 MALE:  [laughter] 
0:02:25.5 0:02:28.0 FEMALE:  Like same people all the time.  But whatever, it's usually fun.
0:02:27.3 0:02:27.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:28.3 0:02:36.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And sometimes we do, like, fun, like, really crazy things.  Um, I think like a month ago- no, it was the beginning of the semester, maybe in February.
0:02:35.3 0:02:35.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:36.1 0:02:38.6 FEMALE:  They decided to get a party bus.
0:02:37.9 0:02:39.1 MALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] 
0:02:38.8 0:02:40.2 FEMALE:  And they went up to the city-
0:02:39.6 0:02:40.1 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:40.7 0:02:45.8 FEMALE:  -and they went to this club.  They picked the most horrible club, and apparently there are all these Hell's Angels there.
0:02:45.2 0:02:46.0 MALE:  I'm sorry, who?
0:02:46.7 0:02:47.6 FEMALE:  Hell's Angels.
0:02:46.7 0:02:47.8 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:02:48.1 0:02:53.5 FEMALE:  It's like, do you know, that American phenomenon of these like bikers, these like big burly bikers?
0:02:52.9 0:02:53.9 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:02:54.2 0:02:55.5 FEMALE:  Oh, I'm sure you--
0:02:54.6 0:02:58.8 MALE:  No, I've never seen them.  I just didn't know the name like, yeah, like that's a good place to stay away from.
0:02:59.4 0:03:02.7 FEMALE:  I think it's a good place to stay away from.  A couple people got in fights with the Hell's Angels.   
0:03:01.7 0:03:03.1 MALE:  Oh no kidding.  You're kidding.
0:03:02.4 0:03:05.2 FEMALE:  Some guy got his- like got punched and it split his lip.
0:03:04.4 0:03:06.0 MALE:  Right.  Well that's crazy.
0:03:06.6 0:03:07.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:06.7 0:03:07.1 MALE:  Bizarre.
0:03:07.7 0:03:10.8 FEMALE:  It was pretty, uh, bizarre.  But usually bar review is just very tame.
