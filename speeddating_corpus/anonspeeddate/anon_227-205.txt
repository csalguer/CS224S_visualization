0:00 0:01 FEMALE: Hi. 
0:01 0:02 MALE: I'm [unintelligible]. 
0:02 0:02 FEMALE: female227.
0:03 0:03 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:04 0:05 MALE:  What do you do around this place?
0:06 0:11 FEMALE: I'm -- Jesus, I can't handle that. 
0:11 0:11 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:11 0:13 FEMALE:    [laughter] I'm at the business school.
0:13 0:14 MALE:  Really?
0:14 0:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  How about you?
0:17 0:20 MALE:  Okay.  Uh, I'm [unintelligible].
0:20 0:20 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.
0:20 0:25 MALE:  Starting to wonder if everyone here was [unintelligible].
0:25 0:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, I talked to somebody else, but is she -- is she in the F school?  So, no.  Or is someone organizing it?
0:30 0:30 MALE:  Yes, yes.
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  At school.
0:33 0:35 MALE:  She's in the social science program.
0:35 0:37 FEMALE:  Oh, okay and that -- you guys all intermix?
0:37 0:40 MALE:  Yeah, which is kind of weird.  So, okay how do you feel about the [unintelligible]?
0:41 0:48 FEMALE:  That is -- that is a [unintelligible] to the GSB.  So -
0:49 0:50 MALE:  Oh, really?
0:50 0:52 FEMALE: I'll give you my opinion if I hear about the F school, 'cause I think that might be very interesting.
0:52 0:53 MALE:  Oh, there's no dating [unintelligible].
0:54 1:13 FEMALE:  Oh, there's tons of it, but it's very -- it starts out very undercover 'cause it's a huge thing.  Like you're in a fish bowl and it's a huge thing if you start dating and we're a little older so it has that much more meaning, I guess.  Or people think it has that much more meaning when you start dating.
1:13 1:16 MALE:    That's what I figured [unintelligible] or not -
1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:17 1:20 MALE:  So I always thought that was the reason why.
1:20 1:23 FEMALE:  Really?  Do you think it's the same?  Does it sound the same?
1:24 1:29 MALE:  Well, yeah, but how come there's so much more dating in [unintelligible].
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Well, you can come over -
1:29 1:31 MALE:  I take a few classes there. 
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:32 1:32 MALE:  I like the people I've met.
1:32 1:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of -- a lot of people take F school classes from the GSB, so I'm sure you've met a lot of them.
1:41 1:47 MALE:  Yes.  [unintelligible].  Anyway, so why speed dating?
1:47 1:53 FEMALE:  Um, this one right here signed me up.  She is newly single. 
1:53 1:53 MALE:  Okay. 
1:53 2:10 FEMALE:  So, she's very excited about it and so I'm doing a lot of those things with her since she's kind of like you've been single for a long time.  I'm like thanks.  Um, [laughter], so you know about these things so you need to come and teach me.  I'm like oh, I don't have anything to do with you.  
2:10 2:10 MALE:  You've done this before?
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  I have never done it before.  No.
2:13 2:15 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:15 2:34 FEMALE:  Who knows?  [laughter].  She's very enthusiastic about everything, so she's trying to pass her enthusiasm on to me I think.  I just think it's interesting because I think I would consider doing it, like, you know, in San Francisco or something, but it's good to do it in sort of this atmosphere just to figure out what it would be like and then decide whether you want to do it. 
2:34 2:37 MALE:  I know it's picking up in popularity in New York [unintelligible].
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah?
2:37 2:40 MALE:  [unintelligible] where are you from?
2:40 2:47 FEMALE:  I am from many places.  Minnesota, Massachusetts, D.C. and then I moved here.  
2:47 2:47 MALE:  Where in Minnesota?
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Twin Cities.
2:49 2:49 MALE:  Okay. 
2:49 2:53 FEMALE:  And then I'm actually interviewing for a job in New York next week.
2:53 2:53 MALE:  Okay. 
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  So.
2:54 2:57 MALE:  Are you wrapping up soon?
2:58 2:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, we're like one month left, so.
2:59 3:00 MALE:  Me too.
3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  Yeah?
3:00 3:00 MALE:  I'm excited.
3:01 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not excited to be done.
3:03 3:04 MALE:  Really?
3:04 3:21 FEMALE:  No.  Kind of get in this very nice like, I don't know, you just feel like -- it's a nice pace, like you're always busy at the GSB.  You don't feel like you're wasting your time, but it's not actually work and you have off in the middle of the day and I don't know, I could do it for the rest of my life I think.
3:21 3:23 MALE:  I thought about going for the Phd.
3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah?
3:23 3:26 MALE:  But I really enjoyed working before this, so I can't wait to get back.
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  Were you a teacher before or?
3:28 3:28 MALE:  No.
3:28 3:28 FEMALE:  No?
3:29 3:32 MALE:  I've been in technology [unintelligible].
3:32 3:32 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
3:33 3:34 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:34 3:36 FEMALE:  Around here or in New York?
3:36 3:38 MALE:  Uh, Austin, Texas and then New York.

3:38 3:38 MALE:  Pardon?
3:39 3:40 FEMALE:  Dell in Austin?
3:41 3:42 MALE:  Actually, Dell was a client.
3:42 3:42 FEMALE:  Oh.
3:42 3:46 MALE:  I worked for a little DVD shop.
3:46 3:46 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.
3:47 3:49 MALE:  I'm in the [unintelligible] of technology programming.  We're like the black sheep.  
3:49 3:49 FEMALE:  Oh, I see.
3:50 3:53 MALE:  [unintelligible] and we're employable.  So, um, which is nice.
3:53 3:55 FEMALE:  Oh.  And you get paid a little more then the rest.
3:55 3:55 MALE:  Hopefully.  Hopefully.
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah.
