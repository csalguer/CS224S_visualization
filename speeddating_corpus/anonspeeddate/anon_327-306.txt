2:35 2:36 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
2:41 2:42 FEMALE: So funny.
2:39 2:39 MALE: How about you?
2:44 2:45 FEMALE: I, uh--
2:41 2:42 MALE: Are you also part of this research project?
2:46 2:54 FEMALE: No, I don't work on this project.  My research interests are in early childhood.  And so this doesn't really qualify.

2:59 3:00 FEMALE: Um, I study early childhood development.
2:57 2:57 MALE: What?
3:01 3:03 FEMALE: I study early childhood development.
2:59 2:59 MALE: Okay.
3:04 3:13 FEMALE: So, um, basically how young children's identities travel from one place to another.  So yeah.  That's kind of a simple way to explain it.  But--
3:10 3:12 MALE: And that's just [unintelligible], asked me, you know.
3:16 3:16 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:13 3:18 MALE: "I have this--do you want to go speed dating?"  I said, "Okay." She asked, "[unintelligible] I'm doing this research project.  Would you like to [unintelligible]."

3:19 3:19 MALE: Okay. 
3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Why not?  Right?
3:21 3:21 MALE: Yeah.  That's--
3:26 3:27 FEMALE: It's worth a try [laughter].
3:23 3:26 MALE: [unintelligible] speed dating?  You will record what I say?
3:30 3:35 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].  I thought that was interesting too.  I don't think I realized this in the beginning--
3:31 3:32 MALE: Yeah.  I didn't realize this either.
3:36 3:39 FEMALE: We're going to record your conversations, I'm like, that'll be comfortable [laughter]. 
3:36 3:36 MALE: Definitely.
3:43 3:46 FEMALE: But whatever.  I think you kind of tend to forget that it's there after a while.
3:43 3:43 MALE: Everybody's doing it, too.
3:48 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah.  Exactly.  We're on the same boat [laughter].  So what do you do for fun around here in the Bay area?
