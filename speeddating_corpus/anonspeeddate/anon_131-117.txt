0:52 0:53 FEMALE:  For work?  
0:54 1:18 MALE:  Really not by choice, but a lot of different things, a job interview, like I had all this family stuff going on.  So, I had to go visit someone in the hospital, and then I had to go to a wedding.  I've had like all these trips, so--and I have to go out of town again this coming week.  So, you won't see me very much at school.  
1:18 1:19 FEMALE:  Oh, well I bet it's fun traveling.  
1:21 1:30 MALE:  You know, some of it's fun, but then when you have to travel so much and then you have like a fun trip thrown in there, it's just kind of like, okay, I'm just too tired to travel anymore.  Yeah.  
1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  And when you travel [unintelligible].  
1:31 1:33 MALE:  Yeah, sort of like--
1:35 1:40 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  And then when you're never around people just kind of carry on about their lives without you.  
1:41 1:44 MALE: Yeah. Yeah, I know.  
1:44 1:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, I was actually--I went away this last weekend, and was actually hanging out with people from your class.  
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Oh yeah?  
1:49 1:54 FEMALE:  I went down [unintelligible] portrait?  
1:56 1:58 MALE:  Oh, okay through Alvero [phonetic] and Ray. 
1:57 1:58 FEMALE: Alvero, yeah.  
1:59 2:01 MALE:  Yeah, I talked to Alvero the other day.  
2:00 2:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, did you [unintelligible]?  
2:02 2:09 MALE:  Yeah, we've been shaking the foundations together.  He's a real nice guy, a good guy.  
2:08 2:10 FEMALE:  And I have a new friend, nameX.  
2:13 2:13 MALE:  nameX.  
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  He's not a law student.  He's not from there.  
2:16 2:16 MALE: Oh, okay.  
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  I guess he's [unintelligible] out of law school.  
2:19 2:24 MALE: Yeah, I don't know him, but I might have met him but who knows.  How's school going?  
2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  This not a great time [unintelligible].  
2:27 2:29 MALE:  No, I actually have a brief due tomorrow.  
2:28 2:30 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:32 2:39 MALE:  Yeah, for Fed Lit, and then I have to do oral arguments as well tomorrow.  So, I was like--
2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  Are you excited about that?  
2:40 2:47 MALE:  Am I excited about that tomorrow?  No, I'm not.  I'm not excited at all.  
2:46 2:50 FEMALE:  We had our mid query like last week.  Only I actually really enjoyed it.  
2:51 3:11 MALE:  I do like oral arguments actually.  I think it's fun, but I--you know, about halfway through the brief I'm kind of like, okay.  But I sent someone an e-mail, and I was like, oh, I don't know if I can do it tonight.  I didn't hear back from her, and then I was like, ah, I'll just go.  What the heck.  I'll just be up a couple of extra hours--no big deal.  
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  I mean that will never work on [unintelligible].  
3:14 3:22 MALE:  Yeah, well the problem is our professor gave us a one-day extension, which [unintelligible] if he hadn't.  I was happy when he did, but then I didn't do anything yesterday.  
3:22 3:23 FEMALE:  No.  [unintelligible]. 
3:25 3:29 MALE:  I'm with--well, there's two professors, but Coldbrook is the one I'm with.  
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Do you like it though?  
3:31 3:44 MALE:  I like it, yeah.  I mean it's very useful, and he's a really nice guy, kind of funny, but I really liked him.  And it's useful, you know.  You know, you just do stuff that you're going to do if you're going to do litigation.  
3:44 3:44 FEMALE:  You mean you've done litigation?  
3:46 4:00 MALE:  Yeah, and actually I wasn't planning to.  I was going to do corporate stuff, but then I decided cause I'm going to do--work at a law firm for a couple of years.  But then I want to go pro bono, and so I thought--oh, we're done.  Did it ring?  Did it buzz?  I didn't even hear it.  Did it buzz?  I didn't hear it.  
4:02 4:02 MALE: Yeah.  
4:02 4:07 MALE:  It did, okay.  Usually it's so loud that you just--well, anyway.  
4:06 4:08 FEMALE:  I was expecting much more of a [unintelligible].  
4:10 4:10 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  Well, cool, maybe I'll [unintelligible]. 
4:12 4:13 MALE:  Yeah, I'll see you around.  Talk to you later.
