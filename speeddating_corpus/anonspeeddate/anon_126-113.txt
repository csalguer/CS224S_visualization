00:01  	00:08  	MALE:  [horn] Um, god.  Ah--

00:09  	00:13  	FEMALE:  They should have given us a writing class before we started this.

00:13  	00:15  	MALE:  Yeah, no kidding [laughter].  That's why they do that classic sound I guess.

00:16  	00:29  	FEMALE:  I didn't give them [unintelligible] to write fast enough.  Because when we did that practice round, the first one I only had time to say, hi, my name is female126.  And then they blow that thing and so I really did not get the time to her.

00:29  	00:31  	MALE:  Right, then it was over.  [unintelligible] considering that --

00:31  	00:39  	FEMALE:  Right and then I'm supposed to sit here and say how much I flirted with this girl and how attracted I thought she was I'm like --

00:39  	00:42  	MALE:  I just put -- picked numbers for that, I was like 10 yeah.

00:43  	00:58  	FEMALE:  You know you're supposed to know -- it was hard for me to come up with numbers.  I really I could have just closed my eyes but I felt like I had to be reading the stuff and to figure out what they were.  And they were not really designed for me meeting another girl so--

00:59  	01:00  	MALE:  True.  What's your name?

01:00  	01:01  	FEMALE:  Oh, I'm sorry, my name is female126.

01:01  	01:02  	MALE:  [unintelligible] my name's male113.

01:03  	01:07  	FEMALE:  [laughter] I feel like you're going to gun out of your [unintelligible] just kidding.  [unintelligible]. 

01:08  	01:15  	MALE:  I don't know, I didn't ask them to put this on me, but you know.  What do you do here?

01:15  	01:18  	FEMALE:  I am working on my Masters in Electrical Engineering.

01:19  	01:20  	MALE:  Oh, no kidding, I'm an Electrical Engineer too.

01:20  	01:21  	FEMALE:  Oh --

01:21  	01:22  	MALE:   PhD though, but.

01:22  	01:24  	FEMALE:  I hope to be a PhD one day.

01:25  	01:31  	MALE:  Oh, okay.  Fingers crossed then.  Yeah, I went to that experience it was a rough experience. 

01:31  	01:40  	FEMALE:  I just wan -- I think five maybe ten -- certainly five, maybe fewer I would laugh at how bad I did the first year, you know.  Let's just say it was pretty bad.

01:40  	01:42  	MALE:  So you're [unintelligible] now or?

01:43  	01:48  	FEMALE:  Yeah, I failed a course miserably.  And the thing is -- the good thing is I know that everyone else fails

01:49  	01:49  	MALE:  It's not a big deal.  It's a BS test anyway.

01:50  	02:03  	FEMALE:  Right.  So don't feel bad about it.  Well, I feel bad that I failed, but actually seeing the number [unintelligible] that was different [laughter].  So I'm looking forward to my next year and doing really well on it, then I can laugh about how bad I did the first year.

02:03  	02:14  	MALE:  Yeah.  Cause, I knew people who failed and like my friend he failed and the second year he got fourth -- ranked fourth.  Another guy I knew he ranked two his second time around.  So it's just a BS test.

02:15  	02:22  	FEMALE:  I just came up with this great idea I should go speed dating right before fall, cause this is the [unintelligible] right over again, you know, it's bam, bam, bam

02:21  	02:25  	MALE:  Oh [laughter] yeah.  There you go, I'll pretend to be your professor then.

02:25  	02:29  	FEMALE:  You too relaxed, what's the answer [unintelligible].

02:29  	02:31  	MALE:  Some professors are relaxed.

02:32  	02:32  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

02:32  	02:35  	MALE:  But you have to be careful sometimes you get the lowest scores and it's like, that's it.

02:35  	02:52  	FEMALE:  Everyone told me that -- when they you know, so and so is my best -- they thought you know [unintelligible] the best test and it turned out to be -- turned out to be the worst grade.  I knew my best and my worst -- I knew my best and my worst --

02:52  	02:53  	MALE:  So you're good at reading people are you?

02:53  	02:55  	FEMALE:  Right.  Or how well they read me.

02:55  	03:19  	MALE:  Its interesting how some professors they like they're different in class versus like you actually -- I mean I don't really know them personally.  I had Elba Mall when I took it.  He's so funny in class, like every other sentence is a joke.  I thought oh, cool, this guy is going to be funny.  I go in and he's like -- he just finished and he's like chewing out one of his grad student's right before I go in.  So I'm like uh-oh.  I mean he was in like a very bad mood.  

03:20  	03:38  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah -- I - I have nameX for class and [unintelligible].   Then the only other person I had was nameX [unintelligible]. 

03:39  	03:40  	MALE:  He is so boring?

03:41  	03:51  	FEMALE:  I totally agree, but he's on the friendly side.  I mean if you were to ask him a question one-on-one he's very friendly, [unintelligible] not all friendly.  He told me [unintelligible] grades [unintelligible].

03:52  	03:53  	MALE:  He said that?  

03:53  	03:59  	FEMALE:  He said that to me.  And everyone is like, oh, he's so friendly. 

03:59  	03:59  	MALE:  Gee.

04:00  	04:02  	FEMALE:  That was the whole [unintelligible] [horn] back there.  Well, nice to meet you.

04:02  	04:03  	MALE:  Good meeting you it was, female126?
