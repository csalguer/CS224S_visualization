0:17 0:19 FEMALE:  How's your speed dating night been?
0:22 0:30 MALE:  It's been uh, overwhelming sort of.  It's like a mini -- so many people and they keep honking at you -- that's what it sounds like.  Like, what did I do -
0:30 0:34 FEMALE:  [laughter], it sounds like some kind of like negative reinforcement or something.  
0:35 0:39 MALE:  I know, I -- I hope I don't get a hangover from this.  Like in the middle of the night, buzz -
0:39 0:46 FEMALE:  [laughter], so true, so true.  It is a little bit overwhelming.  But, let's do the thing that we're here to do.  So, tell me about yourself.
0:47 0:51 MALE:  Um, I'm Ph.D. student in business school -
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Great.
0:52 0:55 MALE:  Which is totally different from the MBA -
0:54 1:00 FEMALE:  I don't think I've ever met a Ph.D. from the business school, so tell me a little more about that.
0:59 1:03 MALE:  So it's just like a Ph.D. in any other department.
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:04 1:18 MALE:  Except that it's a business school and it tends towards uh, the more [unintelligible] aspect, like [unintelligible] business school is [unintelligible] so there's a lot of [unintelligible] going on.  There's [unintelligible] also but it's [unintelligible] from the MBA.
1:19 1:21 FEMALE:  Two whole different worlds.
1:22 1:35 MALE:  Different [unintelligible] if I say two different worlds then you can compare them [unintelligible].  So, no [unintelligible] classes.  The only thing common is the faculty and you're in the background.  Everyone's, you know -
1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  Behind the scenes -
1:36 1:43 MALE:  Have extra money here, like why don't you get a new computer, but why is the MBA -
1:43 1:45 FEMALE:  Not quite so flashy.  
1:44 1:46 MALE:  What about you, what do you do?
1:46 2:21 FEMALE:  I'm a masters student.  I'm actually finishing up in June.  Um, here in the school of education.  And learning design and technology and I've never had the pleasure of taking a [unintelligible] class.  Although I thought I was going to.  I thought I would definitely take some entrepreneurship classes while I was here.  But I mean it's just -- my programs only a year, so it's exhausting and there's so much to look into, you know, I just never got around to it.  But, I was always interested in that.  I don't know, I [unintelligible] some management science classes and I feel maybe like, that was kind of my thing.  But -
2:21 2:24 MALE:  So, actually what I do is [unintelligible] to what Ph.D. management science -
2:25 2:35 FEMALE:  Ah, okay, okay, well that gives me a little bit better picture.  So um, I'm sorry, I'm a little bit tired.  How long have you been here, I think you told me two years, three years?
2:35 2:40 MALE:  [unintelligible] ask me -- no, it's uh, four years -
2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  Four, you -
2:40 2:42 MALE:  It's my fourth year.
2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  Oh, great, great.  Well how do you like Palo Alto?
2:45 2:47 MALE:  Oh, it's good um, [unintelligible] I don't know much about Palo Alto [unintelligible] San Francisco.
2:49 2:51 FEMALE:  Ah, there you go.
2:51 2:51 MALE:  [unintelligible] going to [unintelligible].
2:53 2:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] there.  What do you do when you go up to the city?
2:59 3:05 MALE:  Uh, walk around, you know.  [unintelligible] once a -
3:05 3:07 FEMALE:  There's tons of great food up there.
3:08 3:10 MALE:  I love Italian food so Columbus Avenue is -
3:09 3:16 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, there you go, there you go.  It's always hoppin too.  There's tons of nightlife out there.
3:15 3:20 MALE:  Yep, and there's some really [unintelligible] that [unintelligible].
3:19 3:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, well that's good.  So how often do you get to take a break from your Ph.D. work?  How often do you get to take a break?
3:27 3:31 MALE:  This [unintelligible] I'm taking it every day because I'm stuck with research [unintelligible] to do.
3:33 3:33 FEMALE:  [laughter].
3:35 3:46 MALE:  But other ways, um, pretty much depends on what I have in mind.  Like I won't take an afternoon off and then decide what should I do.  So, you know -- once in a quarter, I think like I've taken [unintelligible] see two movies for the price of one.  Don't have any money.
3:49 3:51 FEMALE:  [laughter], hey, gotta take -
3:53 3:53 MALE:  What about you [unintelligible].
3:53 3:58 FEMALE:  Well, again, since my program's so intensive and it's a little bit tough um, to find the time -
3:57 3:59 MALE:  So we really need to take the evening off.
4:00 4:14 FEMALE:  Wanna take the evening off or the hour off.  No, I do, I manage to sneak up to the city pretty often.  I have some friends that live up there and, you know, we'll go out to dinner -- ah, man, it's just so short.  Well male211, it was really nice to meet you, take care.
