0:07 0:13 MALE:  Sorry.  [crosstalk]  I'm male114.  
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  female133.  
0:14 0:18 MALE:  female133.  So, what department are you?  
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  I'm in economics.  
0:20 0:22 MALE:  Okay.  I'm in sociology.  
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Oh, I've seen you in that department.  
0:24 0:26 MALE:  And I'm kind of interested in economic sociology.  
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  Oh, really?  
0:28 0:30 MALE: Yeah.  You never cared about it right?  
0:31 0:48 FEMALE:  Um, actually when I was an undergraduate I thought about taking a sociology course, and I actually thought economic sociology.  So, I was like--I was reading the professor's research, and it was all very anti-market, pro-[unintelligible] stuff, and I got turned off.  So, I decided not to.  [laughter]
0:49 0:51 MALE:  Right.  Yeah, that's a good choice. So, what year are you?  
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Second.  
0:53 0:53 MALE:  Second.  
0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  What year are you doing?  
0:55 0:55 MALE:  First.  
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  First year?  
0:56 0:56 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:56 0:58 FEMALE:  Okay.  How do you like [unintelligible]?  
0:59 1:07 MALE:  Very much, very much so far. It's a lot of work.  It has been very busy, but a lot of fun as well.  So, I kind of like it.  
1:08 1:10 FEMALE:  Do you have a lot of flexibility in what you do?  
1:11 1:18 MALE:  Yes, actually we do.  Yeah.  I think sociology button's are kind of famous for being flexible.  So, we can take courses whenever we want.  
1:19 1:27 FEMALE:  Right.  I guess I got problems in econ the first year is very intense, and people kind of come in with [unintelligible] preparation.  
1:27 1:28 MALE:  Right.  
1:29 1:42 FEMALE:  And you have to warn people about that's what [unintelligible].  And they've already seen everything, and then Americans come in and [unintelligible].  And then it adds [unintelligible].  Or for me it was overwhelming, and I would have liked to have had some instruction over a longer period.  
1:43 1:43 MALE:  Right, right.  
1:43 1:44 FEMALE:  A little bit more.  
1:44 1:45 MALE:  Right, got you.  
1:46 1:51 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I'll be glad when [unintelligible]--I think I have like one course after this year.  
1:51 1:52 MALE:  Okay.  
1:52 1:56 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] probably.  
1:58 1:59 MALE:  Yeah. Where did you grow up?  
2:00 2:01 FEMALE:  I'm from Indianapolis.  
2:01 2:01 MALE:  Okay.  
2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  Where are you from?  
2:03 2:08 MALE:  Moscow, Russia.  And did you go to undergrad somewhere?  
2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  In Indiana.  
2:09 2:09 MALE:  Right.  
2:10 2:12 FEMALE:  And I went to London for a year.  
2:13 2:18 MALE:  Oh really.  I spent three years in the U.K. and one year in London.  
2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:19 2:20 MALE: What year was it?  
2:20 2:24 FEMALE:  It would have been--well, it was my senior year, a couple years ago.  
2:25 2:27 MALE:  [unintelligible].  
2:28 2:34 FEMALE:  I have a friend who is a social anthropology PhD at [unintelligible].  
2:35 2:36 MALE:  Oh really?  Gosh.  
2:38 2:49 FEMALE:  He's doing.  I don't know.  I guess I don't understand sociology as well.  Like anthropology is like you learn a different language from studies [unintelligible].  And then sociology is like the same language.  How does that work?  
2:50 2:53 MALE:  Yeah, I'm not quite sure because I'm not very good at anthropology.  
2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:54 3:05 MALE:  But I think they kind of--they make a distinction is they look at kind of populations as a whole.  So, and sociologists look at also other things like in a specific society.  
3:05 3:06 FEMALE:  Okay.  
3:06 3:14 MALE: And not so much just, you know, populations and their kinds of relations to each other and stuff like that although there is a lot of overlap I guess.  
3:14 3:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:16 3:22 MALE:  So, I mean there are a lot of degrees, which are anthropology/sociology and stuff like that.  So...
3:22 3:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, like social anthropology.  
3:24 3:29 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, what do you do outside school?  
3:29 3:34 FEMALE:  Well, I haven't had a lot of free time, but in the summer I hike a lot.  
3:36 3:36 MALE:  Whereabouts?  
3:36 3:42 FEMALE:  Like short hikes.  Just throughout an area, the skyline, down a big basin, 
3:42 3:43 MALE:  Right. Right.  
3:44 3:48 FEMALE:  Through a park.  And I like to cook.  I like to eat.  
3:50 3:55 MALE:  That's good.  You had a problem, the first question I made sure is not, you know, afraid to admit it.  
3:56 4:02 FEMALE:  I like to eat.  It's hard to distinguish I like cooking [unintelligible].  
4:03 4:03 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:04 4:09 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
4:09 4:10 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
