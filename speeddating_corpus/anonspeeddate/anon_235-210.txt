2:31 2:32 MALE:  Yeah I really am.  

2:34 2:40 FEMALE:  So do you know -- so in France, so are you in a PhD program or you already working?  

2:41 2:49 MALE:  It's difficult to tell because it's really different.  I could say it's between the PhD and the Masters.  

2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Okay.  

2:50 2:53 MALE:  Because it's longer than the Masters, but shorter than the PhD yes.  

2:53 2:56 FEMALE:  Than the PhD, okay and then what do most people go into after that?  Like --  

2:56 3:03 MALE:  I think I'm just a year, three now and then I'm going to work in the industry yeah.  

3:03 3:04 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.

3:26 3:41 MALE:  Oh yes.  So you're lucky.  This is really, I think a beautiful -- like the city for instance, but I've seen pictures of the city and the region, it's really a wonderful place to live in.  

3:41 3:55 FEMALE:  Oh it's beautiful and I didn't really like appreciate it, like I went to school in the East Coast for college and I didn't know like what a nice place San Francisco was until I left and so coming back I'm so appreciative of it now.  I'm so happy to be here.  

3:56 4:05 MALE:  Yes, when I take care of [unintelligible] it's to meet a beautiful place and you, you have to go and then come back, okay it's really beautiful [unintelligible].
