0:05 0:05 FEMALE: [laughter].

0:11 0:31 MALE: I can never -- I can't figure in like the -- in the like the forms we get how ambitious people are.  I'm having a really hard time figuring that out.  And like I'm getting -- I'm getting like attractive, and I'm getting like -- well, sincerity, too, I usually like to collect a little more evidence.
