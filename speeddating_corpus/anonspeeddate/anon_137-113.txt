0:00 0:02 FEMALE:  They didn't time that on correctly.

0:01 0:01 MALE:  I know.

0:02 0:08 FEMALE:  [laughter]  Hi.  Hi, I'm female137.

0:07 0:07 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:09 0:09 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.

0:09 0:09 MALE:  What department are you with?

0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  I'm here at the school of education.

0:11 0:11 MALE:  Oh, okay.

0:13 0:16 FEMALE:  So this is very weird to be--

0:15 0:16 MALE:  [unintelligible] here and everything or--

0:17 0:19 FEMALE:  No, well I'm only a masters student.

0:18 0:18 MALE:  Okay.

0:19 0:23 FEMALE:  I say only a master student, I'm a masters student.  So we--we just get the space.

0:22 0:23 MALE:  Okay.  

0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  [laughter]

0:24 0:24 MALE:  You're like here all the time.

0:26 0:29 FEMALE:  Yeah, so it's a little weird to be dating--

0:28 0:28 MALE:  Yeah.

0:29 0:35 FEMALE:  --[laughter] in--in my--in my lounge space [laughter].  What department are you in?

0:34 0:35 MALE:  I'm an electrical engineer.

0:36 0:39 FEMALE:  Okay, very cool.  Are you in a masters or a PhD program?

0:38 0:39 MALE:  I am PhD.

0:40 0:43 FEMALE:  Okay. So you're here for the long haul or are you almost on your way out?

0:42 0:45 MALE:  I am hopefully supposed to finish [unintelligible] 

0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  Oh very cool.

0:46 0:47 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:48 0:51 FEMALE:  Okay.  What's your dissertation on then?

0:50 0:52 MALE:  Um, so I work with lasers and optics.

0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  Okay.

0:53 0:55 MALE:  I've worked on so many different projects [unintelligible] 

0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  [laughter]

0:55 1:05  MALE:  [unintelligible] really [unintelligible] developing technology that helps [unintelligible] 

1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:05 1:09 MALE:  --like next generation like instruments [unintelligible] and stuff like that.

1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  Wow.

1:10 1:19 MALE:  [unintelligible] accelerator or the gravitational [unintelligible] but we do like the--the engineering side of that--

1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  Oh.

1:20 1:23 MALE:  [unintelligible] and then-

1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:24 1:25 MALE:  --it'll collect the data and--

1:26 1:26 FEMALE:  Wow.

1:25 1:28 MALE:  [unintelligible] and so forth.

1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  Wow.  [laughter]

1:29 1:29 MALE:  Yeah.  

1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:31 1:33 MALE:  [unintelligible] it's like--

1:34 1:36 FEMALE:  Did they want you to be a doctor or?  [laughter]

1:34 1:37 MALE:  Well, actually yes.  [unintelligible] 

1:38 1:39 FEMALE:  [laughter]

1:38 1:49 MALE:  They want--they--I guess they're more practical minded, you know.  [unintelligible] they don't see value in something done for science as opposed to--they want--they want [unintelligible] it's about a better [unintelligible] or a better computer [unintelligible] 

1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  Oh.

1:49 1:49 MALE:  [unintelligible]

1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  They don't--they don't--

1:50 1:53 MALE:  [unintelligible] value too but I just--they just don't kind of--

1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  Right.

1:54 1:56 MALE:  --they just don't see things the same way.

1:56 2:02 FEMALE:  Right.  So they don't necessarily see that the equipment that you're making is going to go to this person who's going to do this experiment.

2:01 2:01 MALE:  Yeah.

2:03 2:11 FEMALE:  So it's kind of like rather than you being the person who's making those practical useful things, you're making something that people can use to make those useful and practical things.

2:10 2:14 MALE:  Yeah.  Well I'm making things, but they kind of have a specialized purpose.

2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  Right.

2:15 2:16 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:17 2:17 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:16 2:19 MALE:  And, you know, it's not for an everyday use kind of thing.

2:21 2:26 FEMALE:  Right.  But you hope the scientists are--that it'll eventually trickle down, that you're contributing to work that will--

2:26 2:26 MALE:  Yeah.  

2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  --trickle down to benefit--

2:27 2:28 MALE:  That's my rationalization.

2:29 2:30 FEMALE:  [laughter]

2:29 2:29 MALE:  But--

2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  No, that's--

2:30 2:33 MALE:  [unintelligible] trickle down [unintelligible] 

2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:33 2:34 MALE:  [unintelligible] I think it has value too.

2:35 2:52 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Well and I must admit, for you to be able to say what you just said makes you sound pretty cool.  I mean not everybody can say that I'm make these, you know, new age like [unintelligible] accelerators.  I mean that right there is [unintelligible], you know.  Very--so I think it's very cool.

2:51 2:53 MALE:  [unintelligible] be a teacher [unintelligible] 

2:54 2:57 FEMALE:  No.  No.  I taught for a year after I graduated from college.

2:56 2:56 MALE:  Okay.

2:57 2:59 FEMALE:  But I actually worked at a--

2:58 2:58 MALE:  High school or?

3:00 3:05 FEMALE:  No, um, yes--I--well I taught everything from like preschool up through seniors.  I--I--

3:05 3:05 MALE:  Wow.

3:06 3:19 FEMALE:  So I had two summer jobs.  One was teaching 7th and 8th grade math, remedial math and then the other summer job [unintelligible] for a preschool boy and then during the year I did a teaching fellowship but it was at a private school that went from like K through 12:

3:18 3:18 MALE:  Okay.

3:19 3:33 FEMALE:  And so I literally have kind of had experience in public schools, private schools, rural, urban, uh, people with disabilities, honor students.  Like I've kind of done the whole range.  And then I got into admission.  [laughter]  So--

3:32 3:32 MALE:  Okay.

3:33 3:37 FEMALE:  So before coming here I actually--I was director of admissions at a dental school for four years so--

3:36 3:36 MALE:  Wow.

3:37 3:39 FEMALE:  So yeah.

3:39 3:42 MALE:  People like their hopes were all riding on you basically.

3:43 3:59 FEMALE:  Well, yeah, but--but it was--I mean it was--it was wonderful and it was very emotional.  I mean the worst part of the job was signing rejection letters.  It's very much so.  So, anyway, well it was wonderful meeting you.  Have fun.  [laughter]
