00:01  	00:01  	MALE:  [horn]

00:02  	00:05  	FEMALE:  Oh, oh.  What's your name, male111?

00:06  	00:09  	MALE:  male111 is fine.

00:09  	00:09  	FEMALE:  Okay.

00:10  	00:11  	MALE:  Only my mother calls me male111 when she's --

00:12  	00:13  	FEMALE:  [laughter] like when you're getting into trouble?

00:14  	00:21  	MALE:  Yeah, I am. Not that often thankfully, but when I was a kid, yeah.  male111 or like you know some Chinese thing that I really didn't understand. 

00:22 	00:24  	FEMALE:  But you understood from the tone of the voice that it was bad?

00:25  	00:27  	MALE:  I was aware that I was probably not going to go out that night.  

00:28 	00:30  	FEMALE:  So did you grow up in China?

00:31  	00:40  	MALE:  No, no I'm from Michigan originally.  My parents are from Taiwan, like in the early 70's then to grad school in Michigan State, so I grew up as a Michigan State fan and that.

00:40  	00:40  	FEMALE:  Ah-huh.

00:41  	00:47  	MALE:  And um, actually I went to -- yeah my sister and I went both were born in Michigan, so yeah so Midwestern --

00:47  	00:48  	FEMALE:  Did you say what where you went to school?

00:48  	00:49  	MALE:  I went to Harvard.

00:49  	00:50  	FEMALE:  Okay.

00:51  	00:58	MALE:  I'm a Harvard grad yeah.  So but this is much nicer, like uh, the weather out here.  I was in D.C. for a year after I went to school and like it's still a lot nicer than the east coast.

00:58  	00:59  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

00:59  	01:01  	MALE:  Are you from around here or?

01:01  	01:03  	FEMALE:  Well, I grew up in New York near Poughkeepsie.

01:03  	01:03  	MALE:  Okay.

01:03  	01:04  	FEMALE:  And then my family moved --

01:04  	01:07  	MALE:  That's upstate New York, right?

01:07  	01:11  	FEMALE:  I think its south of Boston.

01:11  	01:12  	MALE:  You say that like you know ah, --

01:12  	01:13  	FEMALE:  Because --

01:14  	01:14  	MALE:   Don't misclassify me.

01:15  	01:24	FEMALE:  The thing is we're now where not New York City, we're not really upstate, we're kind of lost in the gray area.  

01:24	01:24	MALE:  Right.

01:25  	01:28  	FEMALE:  So when -- yes I guess I'm upstate.  But when I think of upstate, I think of Buffalo.

01:28  	01:28  	MALE:  Right.

01:29  	01:31  	FEMALE:  I'm no where near Buffalo. Not even --

01:31  	01:33  	MALE:  Right, you're a few hours drive at least, right?  From -- right?

01:33  	01:43  	FEMALE:  Many, many -- I mean yeah, so I personally don't think myself as upstate, but I recognize for the rest of the world --

01:43  	01:49  	MALE:  To the rest of the people who are ignorant of New York geography, right.  You're basically -- you're not New York City, you must be -- 

01:49  	01:50  	FEMALE:  Exactly.  So yeah.

01:51  	01:53  	MALE:  So, what are you program are you in?

01:53  	01:55  	FEMALE:  I'm working on my Masters in Electrical Engineering.

01:55  	01:56  	MALE:  Wow, how's that going?

01:56  	01:58  	FEMALE:  It's a lot of work. Although --

01:58  	02:17  	MALE:  Sounds difficult.  Yeah, I'm in Political Science and we're always like [unintelligible], which is nothing against my colleagues and I who still work hard, but not like having something like being in the lab or something like that where there's an objective.

02:18  	02:24  	FEMALE:  Yeah and when we're stuck in there and when you don't have windows you hate everyone that's walking outside, you know.  That's probably why they don't give us windows.

02:24  	02:25  	MALE:  Right, that's a good argument for -- I like that.

02:25  	02:29  	FEMALE:  Oh, I know I'm like why do we have to be in the basement.  I mean could you make them anymore depressing, I don't think so.

02:30  	02:35  	MALE:  Right, so the problem is also like if they were actually nice places to be, you wouldn't stay there more than you'd actually have to which would be --

02:36  	02:38  	FEMALE:  But it would be hard to stay there more than 20 hours a day, you know what I mean?

02:39  	03:04  	MALE:  Yeah.  My dad was a chemical engineer or he is a chemical engineer, he got his PhD and he was like -- he was telling me like he forgot, he's like it's nothing like getting [unintelligible] in hard sciences.  Because you actually [unintelligible] certain times a day.  You're like reading a book about history and writing like put your book down and get your coffee and come back.  I mean doesn't really work, but you're probably [unintelligible].  Do you like it?  Like is it -- the work?

03:05  	03:10  	FEMALE:  I really would like to go work, the work load not so much.

03:10  	03:12  	MALE:  Right, that's not really something you can control.

03:13  	03:16  	FEMALE:  If I wanted to take ten years to get my degree then yeah, I can --

03:17  	03:20  	MALE:  Yeah, you have other things you want to do to get on with your life and --

03:20 	03:31  	FEMALE:  Exactly.  So I would really like to know how you compare aside from the weather Harvard and Stanford.  Because so far everyone I've talked to has come to public university.  So I'm doing a little informal study trying to figure out.

03:31  	04:06  	MALE:  Yes.  Um, because I was an undergrad there, so it's different when you're [unintelligible] that much more focused you know, kind of you really want to get out of there.  Whereas with undergrad [unintelligible] possible.  I really like both.  I mean.  I love being at Harvard, that was -- I really liked my friends and I had a lot of fun and the classes were great.  I think that um, Harvard in some ways oddly enough was a more diverse place in the sense that Stanford has a lot of [unintelligible] among the undergrad population, like the ones I've taught and stuff.  Like a lot more like California [unintelligible].  Where probably there are a lot of people but they're from [horn] all over the place.  At least.

04:07  	04:09  	FEMALE:  Massachusetts as a state is smaller than California.

04:10  	04:11  	MALE:  That's true.

04:11  	04:16 	FEMALE:  I don't want to support California in any way, but I have to point out that California is really big [laughter].

04:16  	04:17  	MALE:  Point taken.  I'll have to like [unintelligible].

04:18  	04:22  	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.

04:22  	04:23  	MALE:  Take care.
