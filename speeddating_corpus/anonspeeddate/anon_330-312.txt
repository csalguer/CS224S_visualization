03:34 03:35 MALE: Make--go ahead.  Please, please.  
03:36 03:38 FEMALE: No, I want to be--I want to be a good girl now.  
03:38 03:40 MALE: You know, I'm the youngest of three boys, so I've heard everything.    
03:41 03:50 FEMALE: So you don't have a sister, which is really bad.  Did you know it?  It's, like, rule number one when you meet a guy, you have to lie about this.  You have to say you have a sister who's--
03:50 03:53 MALE: I don't want to lie about it.  I don't lie.  I'm courteous and ten.  
03:53 03:53 FEMALE: Okay.  
03:54 03:54 MALE: I'm courteous--
