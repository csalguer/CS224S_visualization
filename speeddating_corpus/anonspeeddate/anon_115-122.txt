1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:03 1:04 MALE:  That's very interesting.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  What do you work on?
1:05 1:07 MALE:  Actually I work in Biocommunications.
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:08 1:10 MALE:  With [unintelligible].
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:14 1:15 MALE:  Yeah, that's what I work on.
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:16 1:17 MALE:  So where are you from?
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  I'm from Colorado.
1:19 1:19 MALE:  Colorado.
1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, how about you?
1:21 1:22 MALE:  I come from Spain.
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  Spain, okay.
1:23 1:28 MALE:  So Colorado.  I haven't been there.  That's pretty close right?  [unintelligible].
1:28 1:29 FEMALE:  Two days drive.
1:30 1:33 MALE:  Just one second.  Colorado is the state on top of California?
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  That's Oregon.
1:36 1:38 MALE:  I always mistake Oregon and Colorado, that's why okay.
1:39 1:40 FEMALE:  We're over between Utah and Kansas.
1:41 1:42 MALE:  Okay, okay.
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Rocky Mountains.
1:44 1:45 MALE:  Wow, yeah, that's quite a ways.
1:46 1:46 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:48 1:49 MALE:  So how do you like Stanford?
1:49 1:53 FEMALE:  I'm liking it.  It's so pretty.  And now the weather is nice again.
1:54 2:02 MALE:  I know.  I love that, too.  Especially these days, right?  It's so hard to work.  You know its so hard now.
2:02 2:04 FEMALE:  I eat my lunch outside yeah.
2:04 2:17 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a very good idea.  So what have you been doing?  I mean afar from I guess lots of homework [unintelligible].  Do you have any time to enjoy the area and all that?
2:21 2:35 FEMALE:  I haven't done that much exploring of the area.  I want to do more of it, but the beach at [unintelligible] Bay.  The city a couple of times, but mostly I just done some running around Stanford.  I like going up to the dish or around the lake.
2:35 2:35 MALE:  Oh yeah.
2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  Or go lay out in the sun.
2:38 2:46 MALE:  I know.  I remember that my first year I was so busy.  I practically didn't see anything you know.  So I'm sure that later you will have more time.
2:47 2:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But what are your favorite places in the area you like going, like outdoor stuff in the area?
2:52 2:56 MALE:  Yeah, I like in the summer for instance, I like going to Santa Cruz alone.
2:57 2:57 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:58 3:04 MALE:  Yeah, because if you go to [unintelligible] Bay, I don't like that beach.  You know its kind of pretty close.
3:04 3:05 FEMALE:  Its close.
3:05 3:15 MALE:  Its close, but it's not a nice beach.  It's much nicer in Santa Cruz.  And I like Santa Cruz.  Its kind of small town.  Sometimes I do my shopping there.
3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Oh really?
3:16 3:44 MALE:  Yeah, people are kind of, it's more relaxed.  You can tell.  Like you get into the supermarket.  Like here everyone rushes.  Obviously because everyone absolutely everyone rushes.  [unintelligible].  When I go to Santa Cruz, you see so much more laid back.  And I am going with my little cart like rushing and then I say calm down, calm down.  It's an experience.
3:46 3:48 FEMALE:  Well that's cool.  I never would have thought to go shopping there.
3:48 3:50 MALE:  Well I did that once and enjoyed it.
3:50 3:51 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:51 3:54 MALE:  Okay.  Very nice to meet you.
