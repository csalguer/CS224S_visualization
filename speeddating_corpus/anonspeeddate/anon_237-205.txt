00:54  00:55	MALE:  Not bad.  Um --
00:56  00:57	FEMALE:  Talk to everyone you know?
00:57  01:00	MALE:  Yeah, mostly.  I'm wondering if there are others on the way.
01:01  01:02	FEMALE:  [laughter].
01:03  01:06	MALE:  Yeah.  I have two in a row that didn't do pretty well.  It's like --
01:07  01:07	FEMALE:  Now, we'll talk about.
01:08  01:14	MALE:  Okay, we'll just pretend.  So um -- except I couldn't pretend with nameX because we work together 24/7 and I was just like we're not playing this game.
01:15  01:16	FEMALE:  Fair enough.  What did you talk about instead [laughter]?
01:17  01:18	MALE:  Ah, well, I gave her my phone -- 
01:19  01:19	FEMALE:  Not research I hope.
01:20  01:21	MALE:  I gave her my phone and she tried to make a phone call.
01:22  01:22	FEMALE:  Did they record that.
01:23  01:27	MALE:  So we didn't really talk to each other.  Ah, yes.  I don't know, I'm getting tired of the small talk, but like --  
01:28  01:42	FEMALE:  But you know the problem is that [unintelligible] pose like questions attempting to like move -- but there's still small talk like what are you passionate about?  And I'm like I'm sure I'm passionate about something, but right now I can't remember, you know.
01:43  01:52	MALE:  Okay.  So, tell me one fact that I don't know about you that you think is interesting about yourself?
01:53  01:54	FEMALE:  I love polar bears?  Does that count?
01:54  01:55	MALE:  Really.
01:55  01:57	FEMALE:  [laughter]  I find them fascinating.
01:58  01:58	MALE:  That's unusual.
01:59  02:12	FEMALE:  I used to know a lot of facts about them.  But my catalog of facts has dwindled, but you know.  Their livers are poisonous, their -- never eat a polar bear liver.  They cover -- you know they have black noses, they cover their noses with snow when the hunt so they blend in, better.  
02:13  02:14	MALE:  Clever, like it.
02:15  02:19	FEMALE:  The classy predators they are.  Um, they shed their fur in the spring.
02:20  02:21	MALE:  That would be useful.
02:22  02:28	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I can't remember what else I used to know about them, but you know, kind of fun.  They take pretty pictures.  They always look kind of cute [laughter].
02:29  02:33	MALE:  Okay.  I had a consulting gig in Provo, Utah. 
02:34  02:34	FEMALE:  Really.
02:35  02:38	MALE:  And there's absolutely nothing to do there.  So, I filled my head with dirty jokes.
02:39  02:39	FEMALE:  The BYU wasn't working for you.  Just --
02:40  02:47	MALE:  Yeah, BYU was not working for me.  I spent hours surfing the web for dirty jokes.  So I used to have a head full of them.  But, they've all dwindled, it's ridiculous.
02:48  02:50	FEMALE: That's unfortunate when you just can't just [unintelligible] to throw at people.
02:51  02:52	MALE:  I know.  It's terrible.
02:53  02:54	FEMALE:  Imagine how speed dating if you had all of them right there.
02:55  03:02	MALE:  Because I really like the shock value of a good dirty joke too.  Yeah, it's really sad.  I've got to remember a few good ones one of these days.  But anyway --
03:03  03:06 	FEMALE:  One of the uses, well you know.  When you're notching you're working and relearn.
03:07  03:08	MALE:  Right.  Well you know with mixed company and all that it might be the appropriate place.
03:10  03:11	FEMALE:  I don't know depends if they are drinking.
03:11  03:12	MALE:  I thought there was going to be lines.
03:13  03:14	FEMALE:  There should be, that would certainly keep things moving.
03:15  03:16	MALE:  It really would.
03:17  03:18	FEMALE:  We'll have to let them know, really the way -- 
03:18  03:19	MALE:  I would make the conversation roll.
03:19  03:22	FEMALE:  By the end you'd be like so --
03:23  03:25	MALE:  Exactly.  So you're pretty cute, what are you doing after?
03:26  03:27	FEMALE:  [laughter] yeah, where do you live?
03:27  03:28	MALE:  Exactly.  Hum.
03:31  03:32	FEMALE:  Subtle [laughter].
03:33  03:36	MALE:  She's trouble.  Well, that's probably why they can't serve any liquor because it's a study.
03:37  03:41	FEMALE:  Study, yeah.  It's could be studies of like alcoholics or whatever, alcoholism.
03:42  03:43	MALE:  Works for me.  Well, red head and [unintelligible]. 
03:44  03:44	FEMALE:  There you go.  
03:45  03:45	MALE:  It loosens the tongue.
03:46  03:51	FEMALE:  Alcohol and studies work well.  Hey, it gave her an article to write if nothing else.  
03:52  03:52	MALE:  Exactly.
03:53  03:58	FEMALE:  Let's point out that that was a published piece that you know, she gets -- like it gets read more than any other research she's done.
03:59  04:01	MALE:  She's the only one really worried about it in the end.
04:02  04:07	FEMALE:  Yeah.  But I'm telling you, that article has got -- like if you look at whatever she does, I bet that's the most read piece.
04:08  04:10	MALE:  I'll give you dollar if you go shove the horn up subtle's ass.
04:11  04:13	FEMALE:  [laughter]
04:14  04:15	MALE:  Seriously, she couldn't have picked a better like more gentle --
04:16  04:22	FEMALE:  No.  [unintelligible] trying to work up there in your office.
04:23  04:23	MALE:  I'm resisting.  I'm enjoying the conversation.
04:24  04:25	FEMALE:  Yeah.  
04:26  04:28	MALE:  All right.  All right.
04:29  04:29	FEMALE:  So, struggle the numbers, be fast.  
04:30  04:31	MALE:  It was lovely to see you.  Thank you for  a lovely date.
04:31  04:33	FEMALE:  Excellent talking to you.  Yes, yes.
04:34  04:35	MALE2:  Propagating.
