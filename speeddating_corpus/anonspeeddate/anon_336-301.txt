0:04 0:05 MALE: I'm male301.  Good to meet you.

0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Good to meet you. 

0:06 0:08 MALE:  So, they saved the best for last, I'm assuming right?

0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  Right.  I guess--are we really?

0:10 0:16 MALE:  It's pretty close.  Three--maybe three more.  You guys don't the break at the end.  I guess I have--I'm going to end on a break right there, so [unintelligible].

0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  Oh.

0:17 0:17 MALE:  [unintelligible].

0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  That's the break.

0:19 0:19 MALE:  I guess I [unintelligible].

0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  How are you?

0:21 0:22 MALE:  I'm doing all right.  I'm doing all right.  I'm surviving so far.

0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:23 0:24 MALE:  So I've met some interesting people.  

0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:25 0:28 MALE:  I don't know tell me something fun about your day that wasn't missed.

0:32 0:34 FEMALE:  [laughter] Today has not been a good day.

0:34 0:35 MALE:  Really?  

0:35 0:35 FEMALE:  [laughter].

0:35 0:36 MALE:  Oh, no.  So you came here with a bad day?

0:36 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, but tomorrow I'm going wind surfing so.

0:39 0:40 MALE:  You're going wind surfing?

0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:41 0:41 MALE:  Oh, I did that today.

0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  Oh, really.  Are you taking--

0:43 0:43 MALE:  Yeah.

0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  --are you taking a class or are you--

0:45 0:46 MALE:  Yeah, I'm totally taking a class.  Yeah, I'm taking a class.

0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  Oh, today would be Thursday.

0:50 0:50 MALE:  Thursday.

0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Are you in Thursday class?  How do you like it?

0:52 0:56 MALE:  Perhaps I'm in the Thursday class.  I love it.  It's like I definitely look forward to it every week [unintelligible].

0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:57 0:59 MALE:  And then you're done and you're like thinking about wind surfing and--

0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Oh, I can't wait.

0:59 1:00 MALE:  --you just feel tired at the end of the day.

1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  Oh, it's great.  Uh-huh.

1:00 1:02 MALE:  It's great.  It's great.  Are you taking the class too?

1:03 1:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm, um, uh, um, Wednesday's class.

1:06 1:07 MALE:  Oh, your Wednesday, so you're going tomorrow?

1:08 1:10 FEMALE:  But, I couldn't go yesterday, so I'm they're letting me go tomorrow.

1:10 1:16 MALE:  Oh.  My friend nameX is in the Wednesday class too.  Um, in fact, he has long, blonde hair down to his shoulders.

1:17 1:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Don't--[unintelligible]--yeah.  You don't interact that much [unintelligible].

1:23 1:23 MALE:  No?

1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:24 1:25 MALE:  That's kind of funny.

1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:26 1:29 MALE:  It's kind of a tough sport to interact though because, like, once you're out in the lake, you're like--

1:29 1:31 FEMALE:  Right.  How are you.  And then as soon you're having a conversation you fall down.

1:31 1:34 MALE:  Yeah, you just make like one quick comment, like, oh, good job, looking good and then that's it.

1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  

1:36 1:36 MALE:  Do you like it though?

1:37 1:40 FEMALE:  I love it.  I think it's already one of my favorite sports.

1:40 1:40 MALE:  [laughter] It's so much fun.

1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:41 1:44 MALE:  It's so hard though.  It's really--I'm just--there was no wind today too, it was really tough.

1:44 1:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.

1:45 1:46 MALE:  I got [unintelligible] in the middle of the lake.

1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  I hate that [unintelligible].

1:47 1:51 MALE:  I hate that [unintelligible].  And it's a tough line because when there's too much wind I feel like I'm lost too.

1:52 1:55 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But I'd rather have wind and like falling a lot--

1:55 1:56 MALE:  Right.

1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  --and at least get somewhere.

1:57 1:57 MALE:  Right.  Exactly.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  Then just kind of sit there and not be challenged or whatever so.

2:00 2:03 MALE:  Exactly.  Yeah, and then it's like what am I doing out here.

2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Right.

2:04 2:08 MALE:  So, I don't know--I'd love to keep it up, but I don't know if I'm ready to go out to the Bay or anything yet.

2:09 2:16 FEMALE:  Um-hum.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I don't want to--I've heard people go out to the Bay and they couldn't get back to shore so they had to go across the Bay.

2:16 2:16 MALE:  [laughter].

2:17 2:24 FEMALE:  [laughter] And [unintelligible] or the--the Coast--the Coast Guard had to retrieve them and they got relay pissed and charged the a couple thousand dollars.

2:24 2:29 MALE:  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, I'm sure they get tired of rescuing wind surfers who don't know what they're doing.

2:29 2:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I don't want to be one of those people, so I'm getting to like make sure I'm--I can do the lake first and then--yeah.

2:36 2:40 MALE:  Are--are you going to be here for a couple of more years, do you have time to take advantage of the wind surfing club?

2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:41 2:45 MALE:  Oh, that's great.  

2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah. 

2:45 2:46 MALE:  'Cause I think you can rent their equipment anytime [unintelligible].

2:46 2:48 FEMALE:  I think so, yeah.  I hope to--I--I think--I think they go to the Bay, right?

2:49 2:49 MALE:  Sometimes.

2:49 2:53 FEMALE:  And so, and I hope they want to go to the lake sometime because I need to get better in the lake before I go anywhere.

2:53 2:56 MALE:  [unintelligible] keep you in the lake [unintelligible].  You got a few more weeks of practice at the lake.

2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Right.  That's where I'll start to learn [unintelligible] stuff.

2:57 2:57 MALE:  Exactly.  Yeah, I'm on the jumping stage, I think.  It comes right after the turning around stage, right?

3:04 3:06 FEMALE:  Right.  [laughter]  Well, I jumped before I could turn.

3:07 3:07 MALE:  Right.  [laughter].

3:08 3:09 FEMALE:  [laughter].  It wasn't my--my [unintelligible].

3:10 3:11 MALE:  It doesn't count jumping into the water.

3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  [laughter].

3:12 3:13 MALE:  It's not a jump.

3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  The [unintelligible] at the jump, right.

3:14 3:14 MALE:  That's right.

3:16 3:17 FEMALE:  So, what else do you like besides wind surfing?

3:18 3:26 MALE:  Um, well, I like to go hiking a lot.  I like to, uh, I play--I'm learning how to play the guitar, so I've been learning for two years, but I--I like doing [unintelligible].

3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  Um-hum.  What kind of stuff do you like to play on the guitar?

3:28 3:34 MALE:  Um, I'm usually been doing a lot of like cords, but this quarter I'm taking a classical guitar class.

3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Oh.

3:35 3:43 MALE:  So, I'm just trying to pick up some of the things [unintelligible] kind of [unintelligible].  You have the coolest facial feature by the way.  You raise your eyebrow a lot and I wish I could do that, but I cant--no, it's awesome.

3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Oh.  [laughter].

3:44 3:48 MALE:  Because I look--like I think I would be 10 times cooler if I could raise an eyebrow.  You have so many more facial expressions, but I can't do it so.

3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Oh.

3:49 3:50 MALE:  I've tried it a lot.  I spent a whole summer kind of practicing.

3:50 3:51 FEMALE:  No, you just went like this.

3:53 3:55 MALE:  Well, see because I practice a lot and I kind of pretend, but I can't do it.

3:56 3:59 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Oh, that's pretty good.

4:00 4:01 MALE:  It's good to talk to you female336. 

4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.

4:02 4:05 MALE:  A little bit, you know, we didn't talk about anything we did or anything, but...
