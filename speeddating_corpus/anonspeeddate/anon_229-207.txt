0:00 0:02 FEMALE: [laughter].
0:02 0:02 MALE:  Hi.
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  Hi. 
0:03 0:04 MALE:  I'm male207 [phonetic].  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Hi, male207, I'm female229, nice to meet you.
0:05 0:06 MALE:  female229 as in female229 [phonetic]?
0:06 0:12 FEMALE:  Yes.  Good guess.  Good guess.  Oh, there's the bell, okay, we can officially start talking now.  
0:13 0:15 MALE:  I am -- I knew someone else -- I do know someone else named female229.
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
0:16 0:20 MALE:  It's cool.  It's pretty -- that was the first time I had ever heard of it [unintelligible].
0:21 0:29 FEMALE: Yeah, I don't run into too many others so that's -- it can be good and bad, but your name has an unusual spelling as well.  So you can be original.
0:29 0:30 MALE:  I hate it.  My real name's male207.
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  Oh, really?
0:32 0:35 MALE:  So male207 -- I'm male207 [phonetic], totally ridiculous name.
0:35 0:37 FEMALE:  So you just kind of broke out on your own and -
0:37 0:47 MALE:  Well, my parents always called me male207, and it's spelled with a G, so I had this thing on my door in my room, um, so it's G is for grapes, giraffe, something else male207.
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:48 0:50 MALE:  So it's just like that's the way I always thought it spelled.  I think it's weird when I see it with a J.
0:52 0:53 FEMALE:  There you go.
0:52 0:56 MALE:  But it caused all these problems.  I mean all official things have male207 and like [unintelligible].
0:56 1:04 FEMALE:  Right.  Well, then, but you get -- you're like me and have the whole Clark Kent/Superman thing, you know.  You can kind of change your persona.
1:05 1:07 MALE: That's right.  I wonder what [unintelligible].
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, right.  You tell me [laughter].
1:11 1:11 MALE:  I wish.
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  So what do you do here at Stanford?
1:14 1:16 MALE:  I am getting a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, that's great.  That's great.
1:18 1:19 MALE:  How 'bout you?
1:19 1:20 FEMALE:  I'm in the Ed school.
1:20 1:20 MALE:  Okay.
1:20 1:22 FEMALE:  I'm in one-year masters program.  
1:22 1:22 MALE:  [unintelligible]?
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  Um, no, learning, design and technology.
1:25 1:28 MALE:  There are a lot of like different programs here.
1:27 1:35 FEMALE:  There's a million different acronyms actually.  [laughter].  But uh, yeah, it's -- it's been a very intensive year.  I have to say, to say the least.
1:36 1:37 MALE:  And what [unintelligible] are you going to actually teach?
1:39 1:50 FEMALE:  Um, probably not, although I don't really know what else.  Before I came back to school I worked as project manager for software development, so, I can always go back to that.  I don't know.
1:50 1:53 MALE:  That's true.  And this is just kind of something you were always interested in?
1:53 2:10 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, my work seemed to arrange itself around education, so I figured since I seem to be making decisions here, maybe I should actually go to school and get some authority behind it, you know.  So what about yourself?  What made you decide to take a Ph.D.?  That's a pretty big commitment.
2:10 2:24 MALE:  Yeah, it is a big commitment.  I came here thinking, I don't know.  I guess I came here thinking I was just gonna do masters and like just was here for a year and a half and I liked it and some things clicked.  I originally do research with these people at neurosurgery.
2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
2:25 2:27 MALE:  And that was pretty [unintelligible].
2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  Nice.
2:28 2:32 MALE: And at the end of my second year my advisor over there left.
2:32 2:33 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
2:32 2:36 MALE:  So I had to find a new advisor.  Now I'm working with this lady in computer science.
2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  How do you like that?
2:37 2:44 MALE: It's good.  Sometimes I still -- like sometimes I question it.  I'm like why am I not -- why don't I have a high paying job or something like that.  
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  [laughter].
2:45 2:46 MALE:  You know.
2:46 2:49 FEMALE:  That was so true, so true.  So where are you from?
2:49 2:51 MALE:  I'm from Virginia, near D.C.
2:52 2:54 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  I lived on the east coast for a little while.
2:55 2:55 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:55 2:57 FEMALE:   In New York -
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Okay.
2:57 2:57 FEMALE: City.  Yeah.
2:58 2:59 MALE:  Never got into New York City.
2:59 3:01 FEMALE:  Yeah?  I don't know.  I gotta say I'm a city girl.
3:02 3:02 MALE:  Oh, yeah?
3:02 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So Palo Alto's a little disorienting, I have to say.  I'm like why is there no delivery?
3:07 3:08 MALE:  Where are you from originally?
3:08 3:12 FEMALE:  Actually, um, down south just a little but, San Jose I grew up -
3:12 3:13 MALE:  Yeah.
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  I grew up in San Jose, went to high school down there.
3:14 3:15 MALE:  Nice.
3:16 3:22 FEMALE: So -- but yeah, hey, once I left I gotta say I was a -- I was a city girl all the way.
3:24 3:25 MALE:  What were you working in New York City?
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  Um, yeah, actually I went to NYU for my undergrad.
3:28 3:29 MALE:  Cool.
3:29 3:37 FEMALE: And um, then I worked out there for a few years, you know in Brooklyn and Queens and Manhattan and all of that.
3:38 3:38 MALE:  Did you like NYU?
3:38 3:50 FEMALE:  I did.  It's very different from Stanford though, so this has been like wow, like an actual institution [unintelligible] city school there's no campus.  They're like good luck, don't get run over.  You know, like [laughter].
3:50 3:56 MALE:  [laughter].  My cousin is there now.  He lives in one of the buildings -- big buildings around Washington Square.
3:56 4:01 FEMALE:  Oh, that's great, in one of the dorms there?  They do have a few dorm buildings.  I lived -- actually lived up about ten blocks.
4:01 4:02 MALE:  Okay.
4:02 4:14 FEMALE:  Which at the time, as a freshman, I thought was an immense diff -- distance, because nobody walks in California, you know.  We drive down the street to my friends house.  Anyway, it was very nice to meet you, male207.
4:15 4:16 MALE:  Fast, man.
4:16 4:17 FEMALE:  Oh my God, tell me about it.
