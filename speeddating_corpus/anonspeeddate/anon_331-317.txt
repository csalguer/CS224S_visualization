00:23 00:27 MALE: Well, I think that's interesting because I have--from our perspective everybody seems to be the school of education.

00:58 01:00 FEMALE: You're--oh, Jesus Christ, that mean like after fifth year?  
00:54 00:56 MALE: That's way, way out there.

01:14 01:15 FEMALE: You look good [unintelligible] 
01:09 01:11 MALE: You look good for that sort of age.  
01:17 01:19 FEMALE: I know.  So much of a compliment, right?  
01:13 01:14 MALE: I got to grow hair too.  
01:21 01:22 FEMALE: You still have all your hair, though.  [laughter]
01:16 01:16 MALE: Oh.   
01:24 01:24 FEMALE: That's pretty good.  
01:18 01:19 MALE: I'm doing well.  
01:26 01:29 FEMALE: No, that is.  So okay.  So really, what year are you?  I won't tell anybody.  I mean, who am going to tell?  
01:23 01:25 MALE: I really can't compute.  I'm not kidding you.  It's really long.  
01:31 01:33 FEMALE: No, come on.  When did you enter Stanford?  
01:28 01:28 MALE: Long ago.  
01:35 01:41 FEMALE: Ten years ago?  So do you work?  Or is it still on a Ph.D.?  I'm confused, like, how can you be here for so long?  
01:35 01:35 MALE: Because I work half time, too.   
01:42 01:44 FEMALE: That's why.  Okay. You're not just--
01:37 01:41 MALE: [unintelligible] I got two masters.  
01:47 01:47 FEMALE: In?  
01:41 01:46 MALE: Uh, civil engineering, civil environmental engineering and have one in high speed analog electronics--
01:53 01:55 FEMALE: You're--they give you a high speed degree?  
01:49 01:49 MALE: [unintelligible] That's why I do the speed dating.  
01:58 01:59 FEMALE: I know.  
01:53 01:54 MALE: I'm really high speed.  
02:01 02:03 FEMALE: [laughter] Funny, three.  
02:01 02:02 MALE: You're just kicking--
02:08 02:11 FEMALE: [laughter] Is she aggressive?  Physically abusive?  [laughter] 
02:06 02:07 MALE: Flirtatious. 
02:13 02:18 FEMALE: I don't know.  It was flirtatious until you got bruised and then 
[Crosstalk]
02:27 02:27 MALE: So what do I do?  
02:32 02:37 FEMALE: So what do you--are you going to end it all?  Are you going to stay at Stanford forever or what?  
02:32 02:34 MALE: I was planning that but they sent a watch to get me out.  
02:42 02:42 FEMALE: [laughter] 
02:36 02:37 MALE: No, I'm going to graduate.  
02:43 02:45 FEMALE: But you work as well.  So you work in the area I'm guessing?  
02:39 02:43 MALE: Yeah, so I work like six months.  Well, I work like six half times.  
02:49 02:52 FEMALE: But do you--so you do six months working and then six months in school or?  
02:46 02:52 MALE: No, I just overlap everything.  Over the summers I sometimes work 80 hours a week, sometimes [unintelligible] 
02:57 03:03 FEMALE: Oh, come on.  That's like law school people that I know, when they work, like, right after they get out.  It's like 80-hour weeks.  I'm, like, what?  
02:58 02:58 MALE: Yeah.  
03:04 03:05 FEMALE: Crazy.  
02:59 02:59 MALE: Whatever goes, right?  
03:05 03:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  
03:01 03:07 MALE: Whatever works.  But I've been doing a lot of other things too.  So I did some other fellowship programs. I've done a lot of--
03:13 03:14 FEMALE: Do you just like being in school?  
03:09 03:10 MALE: I really do.  
03:16 03:22 FEMALE: Yeah, because that I agree with.  Like, I love, like, the real world sucks in comparison so, I mean, I mean what's your reason?  
03:16 03:17 MALE: Have you actually [unintelligible]?
03:23 03:28 FEMALE: Well, I would, yeah, for two years, um, but I did two changes.  I actually taught English as a second language.  
03:22 03:23 MALE: Oh, yeah, that's good.  
03:29 03:41 FEMALE: Um, and it was, like, yeah, I love teaching but it's--I don't like working nine to five and I don't like being out with, like, normal people.  I like to be in a little academic shelter, you know, and, like, go to classes and learn things and everyone--
03:34 03:36 MALE: Are you doing a Ph.D.?  
03:44 03:44 FEMALE: I'm going to be a professor.  
03:39 03:41 MALE: You're in the Ph.D. program right now, actually.  Okay.  
03:47 04:05 FEMALE: I'm already in the Ph.D. program.  I'm a first year.  So for me, we have, ours is five years.  Hopefully not ten, but some people, but a lot of people stay, like, you see six, sometimes seven, I mean, there are some people there, like, nine, ten, I mean, you know, but we're, like, what is wrong with you?  Like, get out of here.  So [laughter].  Well, they stop funding us.  
03:59 04:00 MALE: Yeah, that's right.  
04:06 04:09 FEMALE: We get funding for five years and then funding drops.  So that's an incentive.  
04:04 04:05 MALE: That's an incentive to get out.  
04:10 04:12 FEMALE: You get outside funding though, right?  Like [unintelligible] 
04:07 04:12 MALE: Well, I got my own fellowship funding and scholarships and so on and then I--started working.  
04:18 04:27 FEMALE: Yeah, see, no, they don't--the only work for us is being a professor so we got to get on out, you know.  There's no industry job.  Industry analyzes poem, quick.  No.  [laughter] 
04:22 04:23 MALE: Nice meeting you.  
04:28 04:31 FEMALE: Nice to meet you too.  Maybe I'll give you four for intelligence.  [unintelligible] 
04:25 04:26 MALE: Oh, thank you.  
04:33 04:34 FEMALE: I'm feeling generous.  [laughter]
