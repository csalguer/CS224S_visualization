0:03 0:05 FEMALE: I know.  It is getting a little bit--

0:07 0:08 MALE: They should've given us a longer break.

0:07 0:10 FEMALE: Right.  But then it would've made the thing stretch out even longer, you know.

0:53 0:58 MALE: That's true, I'm PTR officially.  So are you in the master's program or the--?

0:56 1:01 FEMALE: Yeah.  Master's.  But for yourself, what is your uh, research issue on right now?

1:03 1:11 MALE: Um, it's on--it's a different model of um, customers, or subscribers for a rental company, a rental firm.

1:10 1:11 FEMALE: Oh.

1:24 1:25 FEMALE: Engineering?

1:26 1:27 MALE: [unintelligible].

1:26 1:30 FEMALE: Okay.  I have one friend, he insists on calling it imaginary engineering.  That's so unfair.

1:31 1:33 MALE: What?  Imaginary?

1:31 1:35 FEMALE: I have a friend--yeah, he was IE himself, and he keeps saying it was imaginary engineering.

1:36 1:38 MALE: What about you?  What was your background, IE?

1:36 1:37 FEMALE: I was econ.

1:38 1:39 MALE: Econ.

1:38 1:44 FEMALE: So I just came here because I just wanted to be at Stanford for the whole entrepreneurial thing.  I wanted to see what the fuss was about.  I'm from Singapore.

1:45 1:46 MALE: Okay.

1:45 1:51 FEMALE: So, well, I did my undergrad at Yale, but, you know, I had never come to Stanford, so I thought, great opportunity just to come here.

1:53 1:54 MALE: Sure.

1:52 1:55 FEMALE: And MS and E is just one year, so it was within my schedule.

1:55 2:00 MALE: Yeah.  One of my roommates is first year MS and E, I don't know if you know him.

1:59 2:00 MALE: nameX?

1:59 2:00 FEMALE: Your roommate's nameX?

2:03 2:04 MALE: Oh you have?

2:03 2:13 FEMALE: nameX's a good friend of mine.  I've been there like three or four times.  I told him I'm coming to the--no, I might've not mentioned it to him.  He was sitting next to me before I came here, because we have a class together called entrepreneurial [unintelligible].

2:14 2:17 MALE: He was here.  He didn't--he didn't know about it, I mean, and--

2:16 2:17 FEMALE: Oh.

2:18 2:20  MALE: --he actually registered for I think the next, yeah.

2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Another day?

2:20 2:21 MALE: Yeah.  

2:20 2:22 FEMALE: Oh that's so funny.  I'll tell him [unintelligible].

2:22 2:24 MALE: [unintelligible] okay.

2:23 2:27 FEMALE: He's a great guy, but he has the weirdest sleep schedule.  Every time I call him, he's, like, sleeping. 

2:29 2:33 MALE: Yeah.  Whenever I--like, I wake up and he's going to bed, and when I'm going to bed I see him--

2:32 2:33 FEMALE: [unintelligible].

2:33 2:36 MALE: --you know, brushing his teeth or something.

2:35 2:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  He's pretty weird at--

2:36 2:38 MALE: It's like he's on Indian time in the U.S. 

2:37 2:42 FEMALE: It's the cricket.  It's those damn crickets.  Are you from India too, by the way?

2:43 2:45 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  I'm from India.

2:44 2:45 FEMALE: Which part are you from?

2:46 2:47 MALE: Uh north, New Delhi.

2:46 2:47 FEMALE: New Delhi.

2:48 2:51 MALE: Actually I was in Singapore in August, last August.

2:50 2:51  FEMALE: Passing through or holiday?

2:51 2:55 MALE: Passing through.  I spent, like, 36 hours there, like, 24 once, and then, like 12 hours.

2:54 3:01 FEMALE: They have these--if you stop over again, though, they have these stopover tours, like bus tours, which just take you around [unintelligible].

3:02 3:03 MALE: I just went out and took a tour myself.

3:02 3:03 FEMALE: Oh, you did.

3:04 3:06 MALE: I took a [unintelligible] yeah, yeah, I wouldn't stay in the airport.

3:05 3:06 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:07 3:20 MALE: I got a visa.  I went out in the city.  The first time was wild, actually.  I had 12 hours and I wanted to do some work, and I thought I would go to a caf'e, and um, like, I didn't expect Singapore to be like India in that sense, like, crowded.

3:19 3:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's crowded.

3:20 3:24 MALE: I thought I would find a Starbucks and work there.

3:23 3:25 FEMALE: They have uh cafes in the airport.  You should've stayed at the airport [unintelligible].

3:25 3:33 MALE: Yeah I know.  I went to uh, I went to this place, and, like, I was working, and then, it was Sunday afternoon, I think.

3:32 3:33 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  

3:34 3:36 MALE: And they said, uh, you're done with your coffee, why don't you move on.

3:36 3:40 FEMALE: Oh no.  Yeah.  I must say in Singapore people are [unintelligible].

3:42 3:45 MALE: Yeah.  Next time I had time, nothing to do, so I looked around, I went to the island.  I forget the name.

3:45 3:46 FEMALE: Santosa [unintelligible].

3:47 3:49 MALE: Santosa.  So I went there.

3:48 3:52 FEMALE: That's not--that's too touristy there.  They have a special tour bus that's free of charge for people who are stopping over.

3:52 3:57 MALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that's like for five hours.  I don't like sitting and, you know, a bus, and--

3:56 3:58 FEMALE: Well, the good part is it's free, so that's the good part.

4:00 4:01 MALE: That's okay, I mean, it's--Singapore is cheap, right.

4:01 4:02 FEMALE: But India is even cheaper though.  I would've thought--

4:04 4:06 MALE: I know but now I've gotten used to the dollars, so I convert, you know--

4:05 4:06 FEMALE: How long have you been here?

4:07 4:09 MALE: This is my fourth year.

4:08 4:27 FEMALE: Fourth year, okay.  So you're used to [unintelligible].  I was going to go to India in June, but then, uh, to the Himalayas with one of my friends [unintelligible], but then I decided it was going to be too hot, so I'll wait for December 2006.  Do you know a Indian girl?  Her name is [horn] [unintelligible], she's a good friend of mine.  She's getting married.  So I get to go to uh, what's that area?  It starts with P?  Somewhere near--

4:28 4:29 MALE: Punjab?

4:28 4:31 FEMALE: No, no, no.  That's Punjab, but that's--she's from a city and it starts with P.

4:32 4:33 MALE: [unintelligible]?

4:32 4:33 FEMALE: Yes.  She's getting married there.

4:34 4:36 MALE: Okay.  Okay, nice meeting you.

4:34 4:36 FEMALE: So, it was nice to meet you.  Yeah.
