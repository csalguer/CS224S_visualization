0:00:03.8 0:00:04.9 MALE:  Oh, jeez.  
0:00:01.9 0:00:02.7 FEMALE:  Oh, my God.  
0:00:04.5 0:00:06.8 MALE:  That- I can't even finish these things in time.
0:00:03.8 0:00:08.6 FEMALE:  That thing is so getting louder.  I swear.  It's, like, got a- an intensity. 
0:00:11.1 0:00:14.0 MALE:  I honestly think it- they're just on some sort of power trip, I think. 
0:00:11.5 0:00:16.0 FEMALE:  I think so.  [laughter] Maybe at the end, it'll be, like, five and then followed by a series of ten blows. 
0:00:18.7 0:00:19.4 MALE:  [laughter]  What?
0:00:17.3 0:00:21.3 FEMALE:  Well, like, [laughter] see how many times they can blow before we all attack them. 
0:00:21.0 0:00:25.5 MALE:  Okay.  Maybe that's part of- maybe that's the actual experiment, right?
0:00:23.8 0:00:24.2 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:00:26.8 0:00:28.2 MALE:  The speed dating has nothing to do with it. 
0:00:26.3 0:00:47.0 FEMALE:  Yeah, actually, um, hold on just one-  Did you ever hear about that experiment where they, um- they sat one person in a room and one person behind a buzzer, and the person behind the buzzer was told to press the buzzer and to give the other person in the room a shock. 
0:00:49.5 0:00:50.2 MALE:  Yeah. 
0:00:47.6 0:00:50.4 FEMALE:  And, yeah, so it's kind of like that.  They weren't actually testing for the- 
0:00:52.8 0:00:54.0 MALE:  They're just torturing- 
0:00:50.9 0:00:51.4 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:00:53.8 0:00:56.7 MALE:  Because they weren't even- they weren't shocking the guy, actually.
0:00:54.3 0:00:55.5 FEMALE:  No, it was just somebody yelling. 
0:00:58.2 0:01:01.5 MALE:  Yeah.  So what is your- uh, so you're a psychology major?
0:00:59.1 0:01:00.4 FEMALE:  Actually, no.  I'm Immunology. 
0:01:03.4 0:01:04.0 MALE:  A what?
0:01:01.5 0:01:02.5 FEMALE:  Immunology. 
0:01:04.7 0:01:10.1 MALE:  Oh, immunology.  I was like- I thought you said, Indianologist.  What is that?  Learn something new every day. 
0:01:07.7 0:01:08.1 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:01:10.3 0:01:13.2 MALE:  So how'd you get into that little situation? 
0:01:10.8 0:01:11.4 FEMALE:  Um- 
0:01:13.3 0:01:16.4 MALE:  This is really bothering me.  I think I'm chaffing. [unintelligible]
0:01:13.3 0:01:17.1 FEMALE:  It is.  Do you notice that the guys are- guys' little microphones are different from the girls'?
0:01:19.8 0:01:21.8 MALE:  I don't think we actually have microphones, is my theory. 
0:01:20.2 0:01:20.6 FEMALE:  What?
0:01:22.5 0:01:28.7 MALE:  Like, someone asked me the other day, they were like, Do you think they're actually-  one of the girls is claiming that you're not even- not even being recorded. 
0:01:26.2 0:01:27.3 FEMALE:  'Cause ours is different. 
0:01:30.9 0:01:32.8 MALE:  It does say, though- it does say it's recording. 
0:01:30.1 0:01:35.8 FEMALE:  Huh. Okay.  Oh, it's counting.  I've been going for a minute- and hour and fifty-two minutes. 
0:01:35.6 0:01:40.2 MALE:  Yeah, we're probably causing problems.  Ruining the study as we speak.  Anyway- 
0:01:38.1 0:01:38.3 FEMALE:  Um-   
0:01:40.8 0:01:42.2 MALE:  So how'd you get into Immunology?
0:01:40.0 0:01:42.9 FEMALE:  Well, I studied genetics as an undergrad, and- 
0:01:45.2 0:01:45.9 MALE:  Did you go to Stanford?
0:01:43.5 0:01:45.3 FEMALE:  Actually no.  Back at Iowa State. 
0:01:47.9 0:01:49.4 MALE:  Oh, yeah?  Go Cyclones.
0:01:47.2 0:01:48.5 FEMALE:  Rock on.  Where are you from?
0:01:51.1 0:01:53.5 MALE:  I'm from, uh, the Pacific Northwest. [laughter]
0:01:50.3 0:01:52.1 FEMALE:  [laughter]  How do you know about the Cyclones?
0:01:54.2 0:01:56.5 MALE:  Hey, everyone knows Iowa State Cyclones, right?
0:01:53.7 0:01:56.6 FEMALE:  Well, you got it right.  Most people are like, Oh, yeah.  The hot guys, right?
0:01:57.1 0:01:59.4 MALE:  Yeah.  Best wrestling program in the country. 
0:01:57.6 0:02:00.1 FEMALE:  Wrestling, yes.  With, uh, Cal Sanderson and- 
0:02:00.8 0:02:04.3 MALE:  Right.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at you.
0:02:00.8 0:02:03.3 FEMALE:  He went to the Olympics.  He got a- he got a gold, didn't he?
0:02:06.0 0:02:07.1 MALE:  I believe he did, yeah. 
0:02:03.9 0:02:09.1 FEMALE:  I think he did.  And I think he's actually coaching.  I can't remember if it's at Iowa or Iowa State, now. 
0:02:11.5 0:02:21.8 MALE:  That's a good move, versus the guy- who was the other guy that won the gold in, um, Greco-Roman and that, and then he went to the professional, uh, like, World Wrestling Federation?  You remember who I'm talking about?
0:02:19.0 0:02:24.6 FEMALE:  I don't- I don't know who you're talking about.  Actually, um, I don't really follow Greco-Roman wrestling all that much. 
0:02:26.0 0:02:29.1 MALE:  [laughter] So are you from Iowa originally?
0:02:26.6 0:02:28.2 FEMALE:  I'm from Minneapolis, actually. 
0:02:30.3 0:02:33.4 MALE:  Oh, yeah?  I hear Minneapolis is like just this awesome city. 
0:02:30.9 0:02:33.8 FEMALE:  It is.  It's really cool.  It's, like, one of those small big cities.  You've got- 
0:02:35.9 0:02:39.9 MALE:  Yeah, everyone says it gets a bad rap.  They're like, no, no, it's really quite nice. 
0:02:36.2 0:02:39.8 FEMALE:  Well, I think the main reason it gets a bad rap is because it's so cold in the winter. 
0:02:42.3 0:02:42.9 MALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:40.5 0:02:40.9 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:43.8 0:02:48.1 MALE:  So then what caused you- just after you finished Iowa State, you came out here?
0:02:45.9 0:02:48.5 FEMALE:  Well, they've got one of the best immunology programs here. 
0:02:50.5 0:02:53.1 MALE:  Yeah.  So you're like, what the heck.  Shake it up.  
0:02:48.8 0:02:50.7 FEMALE:  I wanted to shake things up a little, you know?
0:02:53.2 0:02:54.4 MALE:  So how long have you been out here for?
0:02:52.2 0:02:53.9 FEMALE:  Um, I'm a first year, actually.
0:02:56.4 0:02:57.3 MALE:  Oh, really? 
0:02:54.6 0:02:55.8 FEMALE:  This is my first year. 
0:02:57.5 0:02:58.8 MALE:  And directly out of undergrad?
0:02:56.5 0:02:57.0 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:59.1 0:03:00.1 MALE:  Oh, wow.
0:02:57.8 0:02:58.2 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:03:00.3 0:03:01.4 MALE:  So do you like California?
0:02:59.1 0:03:02.1 FEMALE:  I do.  There's more people than I'm used to. 
0:03:04.9 0:03:05.8 MALE:  More people, what?
0:03:03.4 0:03:04.7 FEMALE:  More people than I'm used to. 
0:03:07.4 0:03:10.4 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  For sure.  Like, just on the roads and things?  [laughter]
0:03:07.5 0:03:14.6 FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah, just in, like, stores and stuff.  But, um, it's really beautiful.  And everybody's really nice.  So- 
0:03:12.6 0:03:17.3 MALE:  Yeah.  That's good. 
0:03:15.2 0:03:16.5 FEMALE:  Well, plenty of hiking opportunities. 
0:03:18.9 0:03:27.1 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  For sure.  There's the best thing with the Bay area, right, is that you can get, like- even if you'd live in San Francisco, like you can get out of the city so quickly.  It's amazing. 
0:03:21.9 0:03:22.8 FEMALE:  You can go everywhere. 
0:03:27.7 0:03:29.9 MALE:  So where do you live on- do you live on campus?
0:03:27.7 0:03:30.7 FEMALE:  Um, no.  Actually, I live over, um, off Sand Hill. 
0:03:33.7 0:03:37.0 MALE:  Oh, yeah?  In those, um, one of those apartments- 
0:03:34.2 0:03:34.9 FEMALE:  Sharon Heights. 
0:03:36.7 0:03:37.8 MALE:  Yeah, Sharon Heights?
0:03:35.1 0:03:36.0 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah. Over there. 
0:03:38.1 0:03:39.1 MALE:  Right by the Safeway. 
0:03:37.1 0:03:39.8 FEMALE:  Right by the secret Safeway. [laughter]  
0:03:40.6 0:03:43.1 MALE:  The secret Safeway.  It is secret.  It's good, though.  I like it. 
0:03:41.0 0:03:46.0 FEMALE:  Yeah, it doesn't have a bakery, though, actually.  I was gonna buy a pie last week, and I discovered there is no bakery. 
0:03:48.1 0:03:53.2 MALE:  So you went an entire year not realizing there wasn't a bakery until- [laughter]
0:03:48.5 0:03:55.1 FEMALE:  Well, I don't go [laughter] to the Safeway all that much.  So it was a happenstance thing. 
0:03:58.1 0:04:00.5 MALE:  So now, do you get the summer off?  Are you going back to- 
0:03:58.0 0:04:00.5 FEMALE:  Um, we actually have qualifying exams this summer. 
0:04:02.8 0:04:03.3 MALE:  Really?
0:04:00.9 0:04:03.0 FEMALE:  And classes.  Yeah, can you believe it?
0:04:03.1 0:04:04.2 [horn]
0:04:05.8 0:04:08.3 MALE:  So [unintelligible]. 
0:04:05.1 0:04:06.2 FEMALE:  What school are you in?
0:04:08.7 0:04:09.3 MALE:  Business school.
0:04:06.8 0:04:07.7 FEMALE:  Business school.
0:04:09.9 0:04:14.5 MALE:  It's not quite as intense as the, uh, PhD thing.  [laughter], but it's fun. 
0:04:08.9 0:04:12.0 FEMALE:  [laughter] It's nice to meet you.
0:04:14.3 0:04:15.2 MALE:  Very nice meeting you, too. 
0:04:13.3 0:04:14.1 FEMALE:  Have a good one.
