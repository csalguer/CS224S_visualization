1:12 1:14 MALE: Policy or what?

1:17 1:22 FEMALE: No, it's uh, it's called social science in education, but it's pretty broad.  I do, like, higher ed stuff.  Yeah.

1:19 1:20 MALE: Oh cool.

1:23 1:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  I want to work, like, I want to work at a college in, like, academic services or something like that.

1:29 1:33 MALE: That should be fun.  I'm in management science and engineering, so I--

1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

1:33 1:46 MALE: Did more of my undergrad stuff in, like, French and psychology, so I'm less of a, an engineer.  [unintelligible] most people thinking that I like to be, but uh afterwards I probably am going to try to maybe work at a consulting firm or something, you know.

1:50 1:51 FEMALE: That's cool.

1:48 1:53 MALE: Ideally it'd be nice to work for the Disney company.  That's sort of my, you know, number one cool place to work.

1:55 1:56 FEMALE: Ah.

1:53 1:54 MALE: At least for a little while.

1:57 1:59 FEMALE: It could happen.  They recruit here, right?

1:56 2:04 MALE: Yeah.  I've been to their, their presentation for it, and you know, they always give you like a little Mickey doll, and I give them my resume, and nothing comes back yet, but--

2:07 2:09 FEMALE: Ah, cross your fingers.

2:06 2:07 MALE: Yeah exactly.

2:10 2:11 FEMALE: How long do you have here?

2:08 2:09 MALE: Actually I'm graduating this June, it's--

2:12 2:13 FEMALE: Oh cool.

2:09 2:11 MALE: --hard to believe [unintelligible].

2:15 2:18 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  Good.  Yeah.  Me too.  Are you doing the big graduation or your own, like?

2:15 2:19 MALE: Um, I didn't know there was a May graduation, but [unintelligible] so.

2:22 2:26 FEMALE: Oh well there's, like a, like, the undergrad I think with everyone, like--

2:24 2:25 MALE: Oh yeah.

2:28 2:29 FEMALE: That's like, the main--

2:25 2:27 MALE: Like the, oh, the big one, yeah, sorry, yeah.

2:30 2:31 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, that's the big one.

2:28 2:29 MALE: Yeah.  And--

2:31 2:33 FEMALE: And then your--there's your department ones.

2:30 2:32 MALE: Yeah.  I'm gonna do the Steve Jobs and, and the department one.

2:36 2:40 FEMALE: Oh okay.  Did you guys have, like, your own invitations to--?

2:37 2:42 MALE: No, see, I actually, like, just got put on the graduation list today.

2:45 2:46 FEMALE: Oh really?

2:43 2:44 MALE: So I haven't, I haven't really gotten all my stuff, like.

2:47 2:48 FEMALE: Oh okay.

2:44 2:45 MALE: But yeah.

2:48 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah we don't have invitations.  I was, like, upset about that.

2:48 2:50 MALE: I know, I haven't gotten any.  I've ordered my cap and gown though.

2:53 2:55 FEMALE: Oh yeah I've done that too.

2:51 2:52 MALE: And I'm so happy that we get, like, hoods and stuff.

2:55 2:58 FEMALE: Oh yeah, that's cool.  Yeah.  I'm really excited.

2:55 3:03 MALE: I've, I've actually found out--I, I don't know if this is a good thing or not, but that graduate students, like--have you been to, like, an undergrad graduation here or something?  Or?

3:06 3:07 FEMALE: No.

3:04 3:13 MALE: Basically the undergrads just have like the wacky walk, where they come in, like, really smart aleck and they do, like, you know, pretend to fall and have crazy, like, stuff on their regalia.

3:16 3:17 FEMALE: Oh that's cool.

3:14 3:16 MALE: And so I found out that graduate students can do that as well.

3:19 3:20 FEMALE: Oh.

3:17 3:24 MALE: And so I am--I'm like tempted do I, you know, really want to look stupid during my graduation ceremony or do something tasteful or, you know, say it traditional, so I'm--

3:27 3:29 FEMALE: [laughter] So you're trying to figure it out.

3:26 3:27 MALE: Yeah.

3:30 3:31 FEMALE: Oh.

3:27 3:31 MALE: Probably do something more like a little bit distinctive, just so, you know, my family can [unintelligible].

3:34 3:36 FEMALE: [laughter] That's a good idea.

3:32 3:35 MALE: I doubt it, I doubt it'll be like on a slip and slide or something.

3:38 3:44 FEMALE: [laughter] Maybe I'll just draw something on my, like, cap, or my, uh, my hat or whatever.

3:41 3:43 MALE: Yeah.  Here I am.

3:46 3:47 FEMALE: Yeah.  [laughter]

3:44 3:50 MALE: It's actually like an informal ceremony.  All you do is, like, stand up and you don't really get to go on stage or anything.

3:53 3:54 FEMALE: Oh really?

3:51 3:53 MALE: At least during the big one.  I'm sure at the small one [unintelligible].

3:56 4:02 FEMALE: Oh that's how mine was too for undergrad.  I wonder--I don't know how--what it's gonna be for my school, like.  [horn]  Hopefully.

3:59 4:02 MALE: [unintelligible] we'll see how it works out.  Um what was your undergrad then?

4:05 4:09 FEMALE: Uh, San Jose State, and I did it in journalism.

4:06 4:09 MALE: So you, you've just been, like, the general area this whole time.

4:12 4:16 FEMALE: Yeah.  I'm like all over the place [laughter].  So [unintelligible].

4:13 4:14 MALE: Well thank you very much.

4:17 4:19 FEMALE: Oh it's nice [unintelligible].

4:15 4:17 MALE: I guess, I guess I sort of [unintelligible].

4:20 4:22 FEMALE: [unintelligible] [laughter].
