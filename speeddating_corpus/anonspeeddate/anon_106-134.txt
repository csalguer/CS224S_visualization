0:00:08.6 0:00:10.0 MALE:  Uh-huh.  With the tape recorder.  
0:00:09.7 0:00:10.4 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:00:10.2 0:00:12.1 MALE:  Okay, you'll just have to talk loud so--

0:00:15.2 0:00:16.9 FEMALE:  Oh right. [laughter]  
0:00:16.0 0:00:18.9 MALE:  [laughter] [unintelligible] tape recorder [unintelligible] 
0:00:17.0 0:00:21.6 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:00:21.1 0:00:24.6 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I couldn't figure it out well either.  I'm balancing it.
0:00:24.7 0:00:25.5 FEMALE:  Oh are you?
0:00:25.2 0:00:26.3 MALE:  On here.  Yeah.
0:00:25.9 0:00:29.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And male106, what- what program are you in?
0:00:29.1 0:00:30.1 MALE:  Computer science.
0:00:30.1 0:00:31.6 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:00:30.6 0:00:32.8 MALE:  I'm working in the genetics department.
0:00:33.2 0:00:33.8 FEMALE:  Oh.
0:00:33.2 0:00:36.2 MALE:  I'm interested in computational biology.
0:00:36.2 0:00:36.7 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:37.0 0:00:38.8 MALE:  Right now, so- what-
0:00:37.9 0:00:40.4 FEMALE:  Okay, so [unintelligible] like double, I mean--
0:00:40.2 0:00:40.7 MALE:  No--
0:00:40.4 0:00:46.0 FEMALE:  Just like [unintelligible] computer science [unintelligible] 
0:00:45.4 0:00:49.2 MALE:  Yeah, well I'm working there like as a research assistant.
0:00:49.3 0:00:49.9 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:00:49.5 0:00:53.2 MALE:  Like I've taken all the- the classes I'm taking are all computer science-
0:00:53.6 0:00:54.2 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:53.5 0:00:56.8 MALE:  --somewhat computational biology classes, but--
0:00:56.8 0:00:57.5 FEMALE:  Cool.
0:00:57.5 0:01:00.8 MALE:  But there's not like much overlapping of coursework or anything.
0:01:00.8 0:01:02.2 FEMALE:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
0:01:02.0 0:01:02.5 MALE:  How about you?
0:01:02.6 0:01:03.6 FEMALE:  I'm in law school.  
0:01:03.4 0:01:04.2 MALE:  Oh yeah?
0:01:04.1 0:01:05.9 FEMALE:  Yeah, which is really weird.
0:01:05.6 0:01:06.8 MALE:  What kind of- what kind of law?
0:01:07.0 0:01:10.2 FEMALE:  Well it's only my first year so we don't really have the-- 
0:01:10.0 0:01:10.8 MALE:  Okay.  
0:01:10.0 0:01:12.2 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] focus.  [unintelligible] 
0:01:11.5 0:01:12.5 MALE:  And you just read--
0:01:12.4 0:01:13.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I do.
0:01:13.0 0:01:13.4 MALE:  --a lot.
0:01:13.2 0:01:14.9 FEMALE:  I read a lot.  Yeah.
0:01:14.5 0:01:15.0 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:14.8 0:01:18.7 FEMALE:  Because I mean well everybody has to take the same thing first semester, so--
0:01:18.3 0:01:19.4 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
0:01:18.8 0:01:21.5 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] section, there are like one hundred and sixty people in my class.
0:01:21.7 0:01:22.2 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:21.8 0:01:25.1 FEMALE:  And then there's sections of thirty [unintelligible] 
0:01:24.0 0:01:24.4 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:24.8 0:01:29.1 FEMALE:  So then like you're- the first semester you're in classes with like all these people. 
0:01:28.9 0:01:29.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:29.0 0:01:31.2 FEMALE:  And then you have to take all the same classes.
0:01:30.9 0:01:31.6 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:31.2 0:01:36.5 FEMALE:  So you get really sick of those people.  And then the second semester you take like half your classes with those people.
0:01:36.2 0:01:36.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:36.5 0:01:39.2 FEMALE:  And then you can choose a couple [unintelligible] 
0:01:39.3 0:01:39.8 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:39.8 0:01:46.9 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's really intense.  Like you know because you're- so- so basically, you know, like you take basically like the basic curriculum so--
0:01:46.6 0:01:47.4 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:46.9 0:01:48.3 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] yeah.
0:01:47.9 0:01:50.5 MALE:  Okay.  So is it like on TV where--
0:01:50.3 0:01:51.5 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:01:50.6 0:01:52.0 MALE:  --they call you by the last name--
0:01:51.8 0:01:52.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:52.0 0:01:53.1 MALE:  --and you answer?
0:01:52.7 0:01:58.1 FEMALE:  Well not in all.  Like one of my- one of my classes, actually a few of my classes they call you by your last name.
0:01:57.9 0:01:58.6 MALE:  Okay.
0:01:58.0 0:02:00.4 FEMALE:  But definitely they'll just like call you out and--
0:02:00.2 0:02:00.6 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:00.6 0:02:01.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:01.6 0:02:02.4 MALE:  That's exciting.
0:02:02.2 0:02:05.3 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah I mean it's definitely nerve wracking because you're--
0:02:05.1 0:02:05.6 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:05.0 0:02:07.7 FEMALE:  --just sitting there and you [unintelligible] 
0:02:06.4 0:02:07.9 MALE:  You can't doze off and... 
0:02:07.9 0:02:16.7 FEMALE:  No like it's just- I mean it's very scary because you don't know when you're gonna be called on so you can't really focus because you're like more worried about when you're gonna get called on.
0:02:16.7 0:02:17.2 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:17.1 0:02:20.4 FEMALE:  And then like sometimes the professor is like one of you needs [unintelligible] 
0:02:20.6 0:02:21.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:20.4 0:02:23.0 FEMALE:  But most of the time it's okay.  I mean-
0:02:22.6 0:02:23.0 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:22.9 0:02:24.7 FEMALE:  --like most of them are pretty nice.
0:02:24.6 0:02:25.4 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:25.0 0:02:28.3 FEMALE:  I'm sure that your classes aren't really like that at all.  [laughter] 
0:02:27.4 0:02:29.7 MALE:  No they don't- they don't call out people. 
0:02:29.4 0:02:30.3 FEMALE:  No.
0:02:30.0 0:02:30.6 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:02:30.0 0:02:31.2 FEMALE:  You- you just like-- 
0:02:30.9 0:02:31.5 MALE:  Talk. 
0:02:30.9 0:02:32.7 FEMALE:  --sit at a computer or like--
0:02:32.3 0:02:34.0 MALE:  No, it's more lectures. 
0:02:33.6 0:02:34.8 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]  Oh, just lectures? 
0:02:34.5 0:02:35.2 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:34.5 0:02:36.1 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] computer.
0:02:35.8 0:02:38.1 MALE:  Yeah.  Actually I'm into more theoretical--  
0:02:38.6 0:02:39.2 FEMALE:  Oh really.
0:02:38.8 0:02:39.8 MALE:  --computer science.
0:02:39.8 0:02:40.5 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:39.5 0:02:48.5 MALE:  So like they talk about like- it's not really that involved with the actual computer.  It's more mathematical kind of, I guess.
0:02:48.5 0:02:49.2 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:02:49.6 0:02:50.5 MALE:  That would be a good way to--
0:02:49.8 0:02:56.7 FEMALE:  Do you talk about like- oh, so it's like that you're doing like math problems, or are like talking about like making computers or--
0:02:56.6 0:03:07.3 MALE:  No, actually like how to solve like problems that would be, uh, done on a computer like in computational biology it'd be like--
0:03:07.0 0:03:07.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:07.3 0:03:11.1 MALE:  --talking about how to align two DNA sequences quickly.
0:03:10.9 0:03:11.5 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:11.2 0:03:16.3 MALE:  Or how to- how to find quickly highly repetitive regions in the DNA sequences.
0:03:16.3 0:03:17.2 FEMALE:  Wow.
0:03:16.8 0:03:23.5 MALE:  So it's- yeah, so it's not really- the stuff I'm doing I'm not really talking about actually computers much.
0:03:24.1 0:03:25.4 FEMALE:  Wow.  That's--
0:03:25.6 0:03:27.6 MALE:  I actually hate computer to tell you the truth.
0:03:27.9 0:03:30.2 FEMALE:  But you're getting your PhD in computer science. 
0:03:29.9 0:03:30.6 MALE:  Master's.
0:03:30.9 0:03:31.8 FEMALE:  Master's.
0:03:31.5 0:03:33.6 MALE:  See if it was PhD that would be bad but--
0:03:33.7 0:03:35.6 FEMALE:  Okay.  So it's- how many years is that?
0:03:35.5 0:03:36.3 MALE:  Second year.
0:03:36.4 0:03:37.2 FEMALE:  Okay. 
0:03:36.7 0:03:38.2 MALE:  It can be done in one year but--
0:03:38.3 0:03:39.4 FEMALE:  So you're [unintelligible] 
0:03:38.7 0:03:41.3 MALE:  --too intense for me.  Yeah, I'm gonna graduate.   
0:03:40.6 0:03:41.8 FEMALE:  Do you have a job like--
0:03:41.9 0:03:45.4 MALE:  I have applied for a PhD actually for a few- a few places.
0:03:45.7 0:03:46.5 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:03:46.3 0:03:49.8 MALE:  For comp- computer science or bioinformatics.
0:03:49.8 0:03:50.6 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:50.5 0:03:54.1 MALE:  And I haven't completely decided that I want to do a PhD-
0:03:54.0 0:03:54.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:54.1 0:03:55.3 MALE:  --and if so, where.
0:03:55.4 0:03:56.3 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:03:55.4 0:03:56.7 MALE:  I haven't decided either. 
0:03:56.7 0:03:58.5 FEMALE:  Okay.  Are you from California or?
0:03:58.3 0:04:00.0 MALE:  No, I'm from Minnesota.  
0:03:59.6 0:04:00.5 [horn]
0:03:59.9 0:04:01.0 MALE:  Are you from California?
0:04:00.9 0:04:03.3 FEMALE:  No I'm from, uh, North Carolina.
0:04:03.2 0:04:03.8 MALE:  Okay.
0:04:03.7 0:04:04.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04:04.2 0:04:04.8 MALE:  Cool.
0:04:05.0 0:04:05.7 FEMALE:  All right, well- 
0:04:05.3 0:04:06.5 MALE:  Well nice meeting you.
0:04:05.9 0:04:06.7 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] it was nice to meet you.
