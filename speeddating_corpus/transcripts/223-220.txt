0:02 0:02 MALE:  Hi. 
0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  Hello. 
0:03 0:03 MALE: My name's male220. 
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  Hi, female223.  Nice to meet you.  
0:05 0:06 MALE:  Cool.  So, what, what department are you in? 
0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  Um, linguistics. 
0:08 0:08 MALE:  Okay. That's cool. 
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  What about you? 
0:09 0:09 MALE:  I'm in electrical engineering.  
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  Okay. 
0:10 0:11 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  There have been quite of few of electrical engineering guys. 
0:14 0:14 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
0:15 0:15 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:16 0:17 MALE:  There's [laughter] there's a lot of electrical engineering students. 
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Okay.  [laughter] How many are there? 
0:20 0:23 MALE:  There's uh, there's like 4--I think there's 700 graduate students.  Yeah. 
0:24 0:24 FEMALE:  Are you serious? 
0:25 0:25 MALE:  I mean it's-- 
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  That's outrageous. 
0:27 0:31 MALE:  Yeah, there's like 5--there's what 5,000 graduate students or something like 5,000 or 6,000 at Stanford.  
0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:32 0:32 MALE:  So there's--
0:33 0:35 FEMALE: My departments so small though, I didn't even realize there were departments that were so big.  
0:36 0:38 MALE:  I think it's the-- I think business school might be bigger.
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Wow, yeah. 
0:40 0:40 MALE:  But--
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  I can see that. 
0:41 0:52 MALE:  --it might be, maybe it's the biggest.  I'm not sure. Yeah, when you're in electrical engineering, you feel like man, everyone is an electrical engineer.  And then you, and then you think well maybe its just because I'm an electrical engineer, but then, I don't know, it also seems like other people say the same thing. 
0:53 0:53 FEMALE:  There's just a lot of them.  [laughter]
0:54 0:54 MALE:  Yeah.  So. 
0:55 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Linguistics is honestly really small.  
0:59 1:00 MALE:  How many, how many people are in your program? 
1:00 1:02 FEMALE:  I think that there's probably like 20 or 30--
1:03 1:03 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  --grad students in the department. 
1:05 1:06 MALE:  So are you a PhD student? 
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm a second year, yeah. [laughter] 
1:08 1:10 MALE:  Okay, cool.  So how long, how long do you think you're going to be here? 
1:11 1:13 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I'll get a Masters and then see if I want to stick around.  
1:14 1:15 MALE:  Oh so you're not going to get a PhD student, you're just a--
1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  Well I am--
1:17 1:17 MALE:  Oh but you're first get the Masters. 
1:17 1:21 FEMALE:  --but I mean there's the possibility of like, you know, just quitting after you get, officially yoget your Masters. 
1:22 1:22 MALE:  Right. 
1:23 1:25 FEMALE:  They don't want--they don't tell you about that option, but like, you know, you can do it.  I don't know. 
1:26 1:27 MALE:  They'd like you to stick around for a PhD or? 
1:28 1:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't know, well I don't know, we'll see.  Like, I kind of like, I want to go like do other things and like, stuff, and kind of feel like I wasn't' really exactly sure what linguistics was when I got into it, and then I found out that I belong in different kind of program maybe.   So, but, I don't know.  It's, I like living here and it's a nice, like, it's a nice deal and so um, I'll stick it out for a while and see what--[laughter] 
1:52 1:53 MALE:  Yeah, you can change, you can change your program though right? 
1:54 1:56 FEMALE:  I don't know.  Is it, I think it would be hard to do that though.  
1:57 1:57 MALE:  I don't think so. 
1:58 2:05 FEMALE:  Like you have to get accepted into each one, like individually, and get their, like their funding deal individually done and every-- I think it would be hard. 
2:06 2:10 MALE:  I don't know.  I mean, it seems like it's, yeah but I mean if you really want to do that, it seems like it's possible.   
2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:12 2:16 MALE:  I mean, because you're already here and you can go talk to people and get recommendations and stuff like that, so.  
2:17 2:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But where are you from? 
2:18 2:21 MALE:  I'm from uh, I'm basically from the Colorado, Laramie area.  
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Okay.  Okay and--
2:24 2:24 MALE:  How about you? 
2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  I'm from Kentucky. 
2:25 2:25 MALE:  Okay.  Oh yeah?  Wow. 
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:27 2:28 MALE:  I was in Tennessee one summer, that's my--
2:29 2:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:30 2:30 MALE:  --southern experience.  
2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:31 2:32 MALE:  So do you just miss Kentucky? 
2:33 2:40 FEMALE:  Um, I don't want to live there, but I do, you know, miss my family and I miss being there sometimes.  I get to go home like twice a year, stay for about three weeks at a time--
2:41 2:41 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:42 2:47 FEMALE:  --and I'm usually ready to leave by the time that three weeks are up.  But yeah, I miss it a little bit.  It's really boring though, where I'm from. 
2:48 2:48 MALE:  Yeah? 
2:48 2:51 FEMALE:  Like it's a tiny, tiny, tiny little town in the middle of absolute nowhere.  So--
2:52 2:52 MALE:  Oh. 
2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] 
2:54 2:59 MALE:  It's kind of the same, yeah, Laramie's, Laramie is not that far from like Denver and Fort Collins.  
3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  I've heard of it, so it can't be that small.  
3:01 3:02 MALE:  You've heard of Laramie? 
3:03 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, of course.  [laughter]
3:04 3:09 MALE:  Yeah.  So how do you like, how do you like this area?  
3:10 3:13 FEMALE:  I like the weather, but it could be better.  It could, it could be a lot worse--
3:14 3:14 MALE:  Oh really? 
3:14 3:17 FEMALE:  --but it could be better.  I don't want to ever be cold, and I'm here, I'm cold sometimes, you know what I mean? 
3:18 3:18 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:18 3:20 FEMALE:  Like in the winter you need a jacket, like--
3:21 3:21 MALE:  You don't like that?  You don't need a--
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  No. 
3:22 3:22 MALE:  --jacket in Kentucky? 
3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  Oh you do, and I hated it my whole life. 
3:25 3:25 MALE:  I see.  [laughter] 
3:25 3:31 FEMALE:  I froze my whole life.  [laughter]  So if I was a little further south in California, it might be a little better, but San Francisco's such a cool place--
3:32 3:32 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:33 3:38 FEMALE:  --and like, just there, yeah it's a really cool place.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  I think, but--what about you?  You like it out here? 
3:39 3:43 MALE:  Yeah.  I mean I like uh, yeah, I like people here.  I like, I mean I like kind of Stanford, like everyone--
3:44 3:44 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:44 3:47 MALE:  --like all these smart people and people have a lot of interesting things that are going on.  
3:48 3:48 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:49 3:51 MALE:  You know if you're in engineering, then there's a lot of, there's a lot of good jobs so. 
3:52 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:53 3:54 MALE:  Yeah, I like it.  I like it. 
3:55 3:55 FEMALE:  How long have you been here? 
3:56 3:57 MALE:  I've been here about six years so--
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  Six years, oh you've been here a while then.  [laughter]
           [horn]
3:59 3:59 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Okay.  
4:02 4:02 ANNOUNCER:  Next table.
