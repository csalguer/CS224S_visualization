00:00 00:03 FEMALE: I don't think I'm being consistent, oh, like, you know, here with the things.  
00:04 00:07 MALE: I just go down the middle, five, five, five, or six.  I'm feeling particularly generous.  
00:07 00:09 FEMALE: Well, it's stupid, huh?  You know what you're going to write--
00:10 00:10 MALE: Yeah, exactly.  
00:12 00:20 FEMALE: No, it's like, um, do you really enjoy this date?  And I'm, like, yes.  Would you give him the email address?  No.  [laughter]  I don't know.  I get kind of--
00:21 00:23 MALE: Or just to confuse them.  Like, this girl makes no sense.  
00:23 00:24 FEMALE: I know, huh.  
00:25 00:25 MALE: What's your name?  
00:25 00:27 FEMALE: female330.  Nice to meet you.  
00:27 00:29 MALE: Nice to meet you.  
00:27 00:29 FEMALE: So how are you doing it so far?  
00:30 00:34 MALE: It's all right.  It's, uh, it's kind of awkward sometimes.  I don't know.  
00:33 00:33 FEMALE: Yeah.  
00:34 00:36 MALE: Maybe it's because of this thing.  I kind of feel like I'm being watched.  
00:35 00:39 FEMALE: Oh, really?  Is that, is that the only awkward thing, live people's experience?  
00:39 00:43 MALE: Well, I noticed a couple times, when I wasn't with the recorder.    
00:42 00:42 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
00:44 00:50 MALE: And that seemed less awkward.  The other thing with the other times, it was super loud in a room.  So you kind of just nodded to what you said because the other person couldn't hear you anyway.  
00:49 00:49 FEMALE: [laughter] 
00:50 00:51 MALE: So, at least I find it stupid.  
00:49 00:50 FEMALE: Just smile.  [laughter]  
00:52 00:53 MALE: Oh, yeah.  That's interesting.  
00:53 01:08 FEMALE: Well, I feel like that's what they do anyways, like--so they're--this is my snapshot of what this is about.  Uh, there are guys that come on when they decide to talk about their research, because that's the only thing that they're confident about talking about so they recite their [unintelligible] for their thesis in, like, in four minutes.  
01:09 01:10 MALE: That's unfortunate.  
01:09 01:10 FEMALE: Yeah.  
01:10 01:12 MALE: So you're sitting there going, like, okay.   
01:12 01:30 FEMALE: No, you just, like, look and smile and you think about what you're going to have for dinner.  And then there are people who just, like, come and they feel like you have to make it a bar type of theme because it's, it's meeting somebody you never talked to before so they--you automatically ask questions that you would ask in a bar, you know, like, so, uh, do you come here often?  
01:31 01:32 MALE: What's your sign?   
01:31 01:31 FEMALE: Do you want a drink?  Or...
01:34 01:35 MALE: I actually got what's your sign?  
01:34 01:34 FEMALE: [laughter] 
01:36 01:45 MALE: At a speed dating thing.  I sat down and she was all into, like, astrology and horoscopes and stuff and she was telling me, oh, you're a Taurus.  You know, I'm not compatible with Tauruses.  
01:44 01:45 FEMALE: That's true.  
01:46 01:47 MALE: And I'm, like, oh my God.  
01:45 01:46 FEMALE: [laughter]
01:48 01:49 MALE: Like, I'm too much woman for a Taurus.  
01:48 01:50 FEMALE: And you're thinking--no really, we're not compatible.  
01:53 01:53 MALE: Three more minutes. 
01:51 01:52 FEMALE: [laughter] 
01:54 02:01 MALE: Like, when were you born?  Why are you asking this?  That was probably the worst speed date I ever had.  
02:01 02:04 FEMALE: Well, this is four minutes, though.  I--it's not so painful.  
02:06 02:13 MALE: Right.  And that's the theory, I mean.  Right?  Four minutes of terribly awkward silence and then it's over and hopefully it doesn't happen on the next--
02:11 02:17 FEMALE: I feel bad, though.  Like I--I came with a friend and I came because, like, this is for my professor.  He's doing it in his study.  
02:19 02:19 MALE: Oh, okay.  
02:18 02:26 FEMALE: Um, and we're planning on, um, completely fucking up the study, like, what do you like doing?  Oh, I like threesomes and I like wild sex and, you know.  
02:28 02:35 MALE: You know, I was going to do that because my friend's [unintelligible].  We came together and we were going to do something crazy, just like, hey, you want to go have sex with me?  Okay.  Yeah, just to screw with it.  
02:34   02:38  FEMALE: But then, you know, you get Chinese guys who come, they sit down and they're, like--
02:40 02:41 MALE: They like threesomes?  
02:40 02:50 FEMALE: No, they're waiting for you to say something, you know, candid and nice and friendly.  And you don't want to screw them over, so.  It's kind of hard.  
02:53 02:53 MALE: Right. 
02:51 03:00 FEMALE: And then there are people who are just, like, get down in front of you, kind of checking if you're going to, like, [unintelligible].  Kind of indirect pressure to make sure that you write something like--I don't know.  
03:04 03:08 MALE: Yeah.  I don't think anybody has seen one of my [unintelligible].  I don't know, maybe I'm not being discreet enough.  
03:08 03:20 FEMALE: Actually, the really interesting thing is--because I can always hear what they say after me.  So basically I see them interact with me and they go over there and they say kind of very similar lines.  
03:21 03:22 MALE: Oh, really.  Yeah. 
03:20 03:25 FEMALE: Or they have the same phrase of, like, oh, I'm interested in what you're saying.  Kind of, like, oh, really?  
03:28 03:30 MALE: And you're saying some of the opposite things what they're saying.  
03:29 03:31 FEMALE: So don't do that.  [laughter]  I already told you.  
03:34 03:34 MALE: Fair enough.  
03:33 03:34 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
03:37 03:40 MALE: Any time that man, that last girl, I don't know about her.  
03:39 03:53 FEMALE: Is it?  This is a [unintelligible] or something but he decided to [unintelligible] double E.  And that's fine.  You probably would have [unintelligible].  
03:55 03:56 MALE: Yeah. 
03:53 04:00 FEMALE: I mean, like, immediately after I said that he was, like, actually, I am a--you know?  I'm, like, you can't do this with me.  I just told you something.  
04:03 04:04 MALE: [unintelligible] 
04:02 04:06 FEMALE: [laughter] I know.  Well, I'm trying to--increase his chances.  
04:09 04:11 MALE: All right.  Well, maybe he'll appreciate you. 
04:10 04:11 FEMALE: Well, that was fun.  
04:13 04:15 MALE: All right.  Well, good luck. It was nice meeting you.  
04:12 04:13 FEMALE: And really.  
04:15 04:17 MALE: All right.  You too.
