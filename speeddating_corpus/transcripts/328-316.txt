0:00:43.5 0:00:46.6 MALE:   I'll be the troublemaker.  If you want me to be a troublemaker, I'll be a troublemaker.
0:00:43.8 0:00:44.6 FEMALE:  Go for it.
0:00:47.2 0:00:50.0 MALE:  So uh- so have you enjoyed it or no?
0:00:47.1 0:00:50.1 FEMALE:  Hit me with your worst.  Or I'll hit myself with my worst.
0:00:51.6 0:00:54.6 MALE:  The worst?  So what do you- you want to be like raunchy or what do you want me to do?

0:01:12.6 0:01:15.3 FEMALE:   Uh-huh.  Sexy or actually good in bed?
0:01:18.2 0:01:19.9 MALE:  Actually good in bed is going to be number three.
0:01:17.8 0:01:18.2 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:20.1 0:01:22.2 MALE:  So sexy's number one,  like just outwardly sexy.
0:01:20.2 0:01:20.6 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:23.0 0:01:26.9 MALE:  Um, attractive, good in bed, athletic- 
0:01:23.1 0:01:24.5 FEMALE:   Uh-huh.  Confident.
0:01:27.9 0:01:30.6 MALE:  Not so confident- confidence, um- 
0:01:26.5 0:01:27.2 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:01:32.8 0:01:35.7 MALE:  -and just sliding by.  We'll say that.  Those are my five characteristics.
0:01:33.7 0:01:34.2 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:36.3 0:01:37.2 MALE:  So what about you?
0:01:36.7 0:01:40.4 FEMALE:  I think I'm- well, I go with sexy.
0:01:42.9 0:01:44.1 MALE:  Okay.  Definitely I agree.
0:01:43.2 0:01:47.6 FEMALE:  Um, maybe a little too intellectual for my own good, but working on it.
0:01:49.4 0:01:51.0 MALE:  In bed or just out of bed?
0:01:48.3 0:01:49.5 FEMALE:  In- out- out of bed.  
0:01:51.8 0:01:52.2 MALE:  Okay.
0:01:49.6 0:01:52.3 FEMALE:  In bed, no.  No intellectual processing going on there.
0:01:54.3 0:01:54.7 MALE:  Okay.
0:01:52.4 0:01:53.3 FEMALE:  Know what I like- 
0:01:56.4 0:01:56.9 MALE:   That's good.
0:01:54.4 0:01:57.8 FEMALE:  -pay attention to uh- pay attention to animalistic signals.
0:02:00.1 0:02:01.3 MALE:  Awesome, awesome.
0:01:59.3 0:02:06.0 FEMALE:  Um, I guess [laughter]- I don't know, just really enjoying life right now.
0:02:08.4 0:02:08.8 MALE:  Yeah?
0:02:06.8 0:02:08.0 FEMALE:  That's probably the most important thing.
0:02:09.9 0:02:11.9 MALE:  So why are you enjoying life right now so much?
0:02:10.2 0:02:14.5 FEMALE:  Um, because I suddenly realized that I want to.
0:02:16.8 0:02:17.2 MALE:  Really?
0:02:14.8 0:02:16.4 FEMALE:  That- yeah.  That- 
0:02:17.9 0:02:19.3 MALE:   What caused you to realize that?
0:02:17.9 0:02:22.1 FEMALE:  Um, frankly, a few months ago, breaking up with my ex.
0:02:24.3 0:02:25.2 MALE:  Oh, awesome.
0:02:23.6 0:02:35.7 FEMALE:  And suddenly realizing wow, life is not about that and it's not about work.  It's about wow, figuring out what I like, and this is great.  And so I've been having a really good time ever since.
0:02:37.5 0:02:40.5 MALE:  Awesome.  How long had you been dating him for, or her?
0:02:37.9 0:02:44.3 FEMALE:  Um, him- [unintelligible] um, him, for a couple years.
0:02:42.2 0:02:47.6 MALE:  Hey.  Oh wow, wow.
0:02:45.0 0:02:46.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I don't know.  And- 
0:02:49.4 0:02:52.6 MALE:   And what are you doing?  And now you're in grad school here or are you just- 
0:02:50.3 0:02:51.6 FEMALE:   Yeah.  So I'm in business school.
0:02:53.7 0:02:54.1 MALE:  Oh yeah?
0:02:52.2 0:02:56.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm in my second year, so it's kind of like oh, one more month of school.
0:02:57.6 0:02:58.2 MALE:  Awesome.
0:02:56.1 0:02:59.4 FEMALE:  But then I- but I'm sticking around the Bay area, so I'm like- 
0:03:01.1 0:03:02.1 MALE:   Okay, that's good.
0:02:59.8 0:03:01.0 FEMALE:  I love the Bay area.
0:03:03.2 0:03:11.6 MALE:  So this is definitely- so then this also satisfies all- 'cause I was having this discussion about like what type of people, like you know, who's successful at this and who's not.
0:03:09.9 0:03:10.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:11.8 0:03:14.3 MALE:  And so now also that there's certain types of individuals- 
0:03:12.7 0:03:13.2 FEMALE:   Uh-huh.
0:03:14.9 0:03:18.2 MALE:  -like not- I said there's a certain type of person that's successful, right, as a female.
0:03:15.3 0:03:15.8 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:18.6 0:03:27.8 MALE:  And she's like no, no.  She goes it's certain like game they play or like a certain um, like kind of uh, you know, characteristics they project.
0:03:25.6 0:03:26.2 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:28.0 0:03:33.0 MALE:  Those people she said are very su- or that kind of game or sequence that are successful.
0:03:30.3 0:03:31.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:33.3 0:03:39.0 MALE:  And I was disagreeing with her.  'Cause I said my theory was that any woman that was very assertive- 
0:03:32.4 0:03:37.7 FEMALE:   Oh.  Uh-huh.
0:03:39.4 0:03:41.4 MALE:  -and like kind of drove the conversation- 
0:03:39.7 0:03:40.1 FEMALE:   Uh-huh.
0:03:41.8 0:03:48.2 MALE:  -would be successful at this.  And you're also- my other comment is you're very different from every other girl here, which is great.
0:03:46.2 0:03:47.5 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:03:48.6 0:03:49.9 MALE:  I'm very excited about it.
0:03:48.1 0:03:49.0 FEMALE:  Oh, thank you.
0:03:51.1 0:03:51.9 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  That's good.
0:03:49.5 0:03:52.6 FEMALE:  This is a very different conversation from any of the others that I've had- 
0:03:53.8 0:03:54.2 MALE:   Really?
0:03:52.6 0:03:56.7 FEMALE:  -'cause some my- so what I would say to challenge your theory of success- 
0:03:58.3 0:03:58.7 MALE:   Okay.
0:03:57.2 0:03:59.4 FEMALE:  -is how do you define success? 
0:04:00.5 0:04:02.8 [horn]
0:03:59.7 0:04:02.2 FEMALE:  My definition isn't everybody rates everybody highly.
0:04:04.2 0:04:05.9 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause I think a lot of people- 
0:04:02.7 0:04:04.3 FEMALE:  Its meeting too many matches.
0:04:06.1 0:04:15.2 MALE:  I think a lot of people rate everyone highly.  They just have no idea what they're doing.  I was like why is this girl so much fun?  And she's like I'm a business school student, and I was like oh, a doctor.
0:04:12.9 0:04:16.8 FEMALE:  Are you a freaking first year?  Worst class in 30 years.
