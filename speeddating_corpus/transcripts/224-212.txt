0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  [laughter] I've gotten so damn slow at filling these out-- 
0:04 0:04 MALE:  Oh well.  
0:05 0:08 FEMALE:  --as I have gone along.  I'm female224.  
0:09 0:09 MALE:  Nice to meet you female224.  
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you too.  
0:11 0:11 MALE:  So. 
0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  You got dressed up?  
0:12 0:12 MALE:  A little bit. 
0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:14 0:19 MALE:  I had a job interview beforehand and I like timed it so that I have like, you know, an hour pause or whatever to make it down here.  So--
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  What were you interviewing for? 
0:22 0:22 MALE:  Well there's like--
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  Oh is that Man of La Mancha with Don Quixote?
0:25 0:25 MALE:  Exactly.  
0:25 0:25 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:26 0:31 MALE:  Well see I was like you know, do I change, but this tie is like so cool, why, why leave it behind or something.  
0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  Exactly.  
0:33 0:37 MALE:  But yeah, it was a position with like Edward Jones like investments and--
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  Oh so what are you studying? 
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Not Edward Jones but uh--
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:41 0:46 MALE:  --management science and engineering, um, I do more like working with people, organization behavior and stuff, so.  
0:47 0:49 FEMALE:  Cool.  Is this your--how long is the program? I don't know very much about that at all.  
0:50 0:55 MALE:  It's between one and three years so, it's only 45 units and I was able to get all 45 of mine done so far. 
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  This year? 
0:56 0:56 MALE:  Yeah.  So--
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Wow.  
0:58 1:06 MALE:  Well it was only rough, I mean it was rough in the winter quarter, I had like to do 18 units.  But this, this semester I only have like 11, so it's--
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  So you intentionally--see I would like, want to stay in school as long as possible.  
1:10 1:10 MALE:  Well I, I agree with that.   
1:11 1:12 FEMALE:  I wish my program was longer.  [laughter] 
1:13 1:13 MALE:  Well are you a Masters or PhD student?  
1:14 1:15 FEMALE:  I'm, I'm a MBA.  
1:16 1:16 MALE:  Oh really? 
1:17 1:17 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:18 1:21 MALE:  Well I, I take a lot more classes.  I did um, OB368 and the finance for--
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  Which one's that? 
1:23 1:24 MALE:  How to make ideas stick with [unintelligible]. 
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  Oh, I heard that was really good. 
1:27 1:39 MALE:  Yeah.  I liked it a lot.  It was pretty useful.  A lot of it was just review of psychological research from start to finish.   But um, then I did, you know, the finance four, which was a little more intense then I had anticipated. 
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:41 1:46 MALE:  This quarter I'm in the Politics, or excuse me, Managers in the Legal Environment.  So--
1:47 1:47 FEMALE:  Wow.  
1:48 1:54 MALE:  --should be pretty nice.  I, I figure by the time I get done with MS&E, I'll be, you know, like, have a semester off of MBA school or something if I come back. 
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  You will. 
1:56 1:56 MALE:  This doesn't do so much.  
1:57 2:03 FEMALE:  I know, some people could do, who are getting MBA's, um, are also getting certificates, it's called NEPs right? 
2:04 2:04 MALE:  Something like that, yeah. 
2:05 2:08 FEMALE:  Um, yeah, so you could do both. 
2:09 2:09 MALE:  I could.  
2:10 2:10 FEMALE:  What happened? 
2:11 2:11 MALE:  I know.
2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:12 2:13 MALE:  Well I didn't have the work experience, so I was like, you know-- 
2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  Oh were you coming straight from undergrad?  
2:15 2:17 MALE:  Yeah, basically so. 
2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  So this is the first big job. 
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Yeah, really.  So--
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  That's exciting. 
2:21 2:23 MALE:  I know, I'm trying to get it lined up.  It probably won't be with Edward Jones, I mean that's, I really don't--  
2:24 2:26 FEMALE:  What kind of work do you want to do? 
2:27 2:33 MALE:  I would like consulting, ideally like to work for Disney and sort of like their Guest Relations or Human Resources, Imagineering Department.  
2:34 2:37 FEMALE:  Oh cool. Well they just like blew out their strategy group.  
2:38 2:38 MALE:  Oh really? 
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Did you read about that? 
2:39 2:39 MALE:  I didn't, no.  
2:40 2:53 FEMALE:  Um, yeah.  They had uh, the strategy guy, I can't remember what his name is, um, I read about it in Hollywood Reporter, and they, they had the group that um, kind of did the strategy for the entire organization, and this isn't really relevant--
2:54 2:54 MALE:  Right, right.   
2:55 2:55 FEMALE:  --to what, to what you want to go into.  But just--
2:56 2:56 MALE:  Well but I do strategy too, so yeah.  
2:57 3:11 FEMALE:  --they um, yeah they just blew out the whole group.  And so rather then having it sort of sit on top, now they're going to allocate each, whichever people like, so the people who were working at amusement parks will go sit with all amusement park people.  
3:12 3:12 MALE:  Oh interesting. Well that sounds like a good idea. 
3:13 3:20 FEMALE:  So, so they're now, like sort of pushing people down into the various business units as opposed to having them sit on top in this like sort of umbrella strategy group. 
3:21 3:21 MALE:  Right, right.  Well that's cool.  
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  So it's interesting.  Yeah.  
3:23 3:26 MALE:  I'll have to keep that in mind, maybe do that, a theme park analyst job or something. 
3:27 3:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, well I'm going to be in L.A. this summer, so--
3:29 3:29 MALE:  Oh really?   
3:30 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I uh, I did finance before business school.  I did um, investment banking and then private equity, and so um, I wrote your name down wrong.  
3:40 3:40 MALE:  Oh. 
3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  Bad, male212.  
3:42 3:43 MALE:  Yes, like the red dog.  
3:44 3:45 FEMALE:  I put nameX, that's bad. 
3:45 3:45 MALE:  Oh well-- 
3:45 3:46 FEMALE:  Two F's right?  
3:46 3:54 MALE:  Well one of my friends here calls me male212 from time to time, that's just sort of stuck.  And I'm like, I can sort of see, you know, like F and P are sort of the same, but--
3:55 3:55 FEMALE:  Just put them all together.  
3:56 3:56 MALE:  That's cool. 
3:57 4:00 FEMALE:  Anyway, what I was saying, is uh, so this is like a big transition for me.  
           [horn]
4:01 4:01 MALE:  Right. Well that's cool.  Thank you.   
4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  Well it's nice to meet you.  Good luck on the interview. 
4:03 4:06 MALE:  Thanks.  And before I go, I must ask, is the GSB show all that's it's--that it's cool and everything is done up--
4:07 4:09 FEMALE:  Oh yeah, I heard it's supposed to be amazing.  
4:10 4:10 MALE:  I'm going to try to get tickets I think they're like sold out.  
4:11 4:11 FEMALE:  6:30.  
4:12 4:12 MALE:  What's 6:30? 
4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  They have two shows, ones at 6:30 and ones at 9:30.  
4:15 4:15 MALE:  Oh. 
4:16 4:20 FEMALE:  The 9:30 show sold out but the 6:30 I think is still available.
