0:00:12.7 0:00:13.5 MALE:  Very fast.

0:00:18.0 0:00:24.3 FEMALE:  Uh, exactly and I keep forgetting what I've told the person [laughter] and I keep feeling like I'm repeating myself, so-
0:00:24.3 0:00:28.3 MALE:  Yeah, in France we do like seven minutes, seven people, so it's like-
0:00:28.0 0:00:29.4 FEMALE:  Oh. 
0:00:28.3 0:00:34.2 MALE:  Forty- forty-nine but plus time, so it's just one hour, but so you have less dates.
0:00:34.2 0:00:35.7 FEMALE:  Less dates, more time.
0:00:34.4 0:00:45.1 MALE:  But so- less dates, more time.  But I don't know what's it's all about because I think if you look at the- at this, it's mainly here, right?  I don't know.  I don't know.    
0:00:43.7 0:00:46.1 FEMALE:  [laughter] are you seeing a trend?
0:00:45.4 0:00:53.2 MALE:  Except it's- at the really end, you say something like crazy, but I don't think it happens so much.  So-  
0:00:49.0 0:00:54.1 FEMALE:  [laughter]  Oh, okay.  
0:00:52.9 0:00:55.5 MALE:  But so I mean it's- is this your first time?
0:00:55.9 0:00:59.0 FEMALE:  Um, to speed dating, yes.  I've never speed-
0:00:58.4 0:00:59.0 MALE:  What?
0:00:59.2 0:01:00.7 FEMALE:  To speed dating, yes. 
0:01:00.0 0:01:00.6 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:01.1 0:01:03.2 FEMALE:  Yes.  But tell me, where are you from in France?
0:01:03.7 0:01:04.4 MALE:  Uh, sorry?
0:01:04.4 0:01:05.4 FEMALE:  Where are you from?
0:01:04.5 0:01:09.3 MALE:  Where are you from in France?  Uh, I am from the south.  Yeah.  You- you-
0:01:08.4 0:01:09.6 FEMALE:  [foreign language].
0:01:09.5 0:01:10.5 MALE:  Oh, you speak French?
0:01:11.9 0:01:39.4  [foreign language]
0:01:37.8 0:01:40.9 MALE:  But- but I like to speak French as well- uh, English.
0:01:40.5 0:01:44.8 FEMALE:  [laughter] Exactly.  We can code shift- shift all over the place.  So-
0:01:44.8 0:02:14.7 [foreign language] 
0:02:14.4 0:02:18.5 FEMALE:  NYU in France, uh, New York University and, uh-
0:02:18.2 0:02:43.2 [foreign language] 
0:02:44.9 0:02:48.7 MALE:  Come on, you lost your French.  Now I- I understand you are doing this right-
0:02:47.3 0:02:52.2 [foreign language] 
0:02:51.8 0:03:04.3 MALE:  No, no, no, no, because American speaking [unintelligible] I mean English as well I try to speak really fast and so you're like, if they don't pronounce it pretty well it doesn't matter-
0:03:03.5 0:03:04.9 FEMALE:  You have no idea.
0:03:04.0 0:03:10.9 MALE:  -it's a word you can [unintelligible] but if you're like [unintelligible] things like that-
0:03:10.5 0:03:12.0 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:03:11.3 0:03:13.8 MALE:  Okay, [unintelligible] 
0:03:14.0 0:03:15.6 FEMALE:  [laughter] Okay.
0:03:15.5 0:03:18.3 MALE:  So that's good job.  For really- for one year-
0:03:16.9 0:03:18.5 FEMALE: Well, thank you.  Thank you.
0:03:18.6 0:03:22.0 MALE:  I'm not even as good as you are for one year undergrad.  So-
0:03:22.5 0:03:24.3 FEMALE: Thank you.  Thank you very much.
0:03:23.5 0:03:26.3 MALE:  [unintelligible] All right, are you gonna come back?  Go back there?
0:03:26.7 0:03:33.8 FEMALE:  Um, I- I visited a few times since I, uh, lived there, but I don't know if I would live in Paris again.
0:03:34.6 0:03:39.4 MALE:  Why?  Too active, too big, or too- too far?
0:03:38.1 0:03:43.9 FEMALE:  No, I lived in- I lived in New York, so not too big. [laughter] 
0:03:43.4 0:03:44.1 MALE:  I see.
0:03:44.0 0:03:51.8 FEMALE:  Not too big and not too fast, but maybe too small.  But maybe a little bit [foreign language] depressing.  I found.
0:03:51.0 0:03:53.5 MALE:  Depressing because of the people?
0:03:53.5 0:03:54.5 [horn]
0:03:54.3 0:03:57.4 MALE:  They are like not real friendly or I don't know.
0:03:58.0 0:04:04.5 FEMALE:  It's difficult, you know, as- as I'm sure you know, whenever you live abroad, it's difficult to meet people, so.  Yeah.
0:04:02.9 0:04:05.8 MALE:  I know.  Good luck with everything else.
0:04:05.5 0:04:06.8 FEMALE:  Why thank you.  You too.
0:04:06.1 0:04:07.6 MALE:  Goodbye.  Okay.
