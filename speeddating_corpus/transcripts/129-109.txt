0:03 0:03 MALE:  Hi.
0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  Happy dating.  Hi, male109.
0:05 0:05 MALE:  male109.
0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  I'm female129.  
0:06 0:07 MALE:  Nice to meet you, female129.  
0:03 0:05 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:09 0:10 MALE:  Yeah, it's kind of interesting.  
0:06 0:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, what school are you in?
0:12 0:14 MALE:  I'm in engineering.  What about you?
0:10 0:12 FEMALE:  Mechanical, chemical, electrical?
0:16 0:16 MALE:  Electrical.
0:13 0:15 FEMALE:  I was going to get there eventually.  I'm at the school of ed.  
0:20 0:20 MALE:  Oh, I see.  
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:21 0:22 MALE:  Yeah, you look like in school of ed.  
0:18 0:18 FEMALE:  What does that mean?
0:23 0:24 MALE:  You look--
0:20 0:20 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Female?
0:25 0:30 MALE:  --not really.  You look outgoing and you seem to know something about education.  
0:26 0:31 FEMALE:  That's interesting.  That's an interesting stereotype of the ed school because it's sometimes--
0:36 0:40 MALE:  [interposing]  I think most of the ed school students that I know are quite outgoing.  
0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  Really?
0:41 0:44 MALE:  And friendly.  
0:40 0:44 FEMALE:  Well, good.  I'm in the policy, organization and leadership studies program.
0:48 0:48 MALE:  So what year?
0:45 0:50 FEMALE:  It will be a--it's an all one-year program.  But we're very loud, and we're very conscious of--
0:55 0:56 MALE:  [interposing]  What's the name again?
0:52 0:53 FEMALE:  What's the name of the program?
0:57 0:58 MALE:  What's the name of the program again?  
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  Policy, organization and leadership.
1:00 1:03 MALE:  Policy, organization and leadership.  Like, what does it entail actually?  
1:00 1:08 FEMALE:  Nine months of classes in all of those three subjects.  It's sort of a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything.  
1:13 1:13 MALE:  Oh, I see.  
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  But it's--it's fun.  
1:15 1:16 MALE:  Is that like a Master's program?  
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  It is, yeah.  
1:17 1:17 MALE:  Oh, I see.  
1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  It is, yeah.  It actually was a brand new program for the first year.  
1:19 1:21 MALE:  Oh, I see that's why I never heard of it.  
1:17 1:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, we're guinea pigs.  Are you a PhD?
1:23 1:26 MALE:  I'm undecided right now.  
1:22 1:24 FEMALE:  Okay, so is this your first year?  
1:28 1:29 MALE:  My second year.  
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  Second year, and what do you think?
1:31 1:34 MALE:  I think Stanford is absolutely a great place.
1:30 1:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Where were you before?
1:36 1:37 MALE:  Before this I was in Indiana.
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Indiana, well no wonder.  
1:40 1:41 MALE:  What about you?
1:37 1:40 FEMALE:  I was in Boston teaching second grade in Boston.  
1:45 1:46 MALE:  Oh, I see.  So, you were a teacher before?  
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:48 1:52 MALE:  So, did you have your undergrad education in teaching as well?  
1:48 1:54 FEMALE:  I did.  I actually got certified as a public school elementary teacher while I was an undergrad.  
2:00 2:00 MALE:  Oh, I see.  
1:57 1:57 FEMALE:  So, I went straight to the classroom.  
2:02 2:07 MALE:  Oh, I see.  Do you ever have any problems teaching second grade--was it second grade?  
2:03 2:08 FEMALE:  I--it was exactly where I wanted to be.  It was exactly the age kids I wanted to work with.  
2:13 2:16 MALE:  Is that what you plan on doing after you graduate from Stanford, going to second grade?
2:12 2:21 FEMALE:  No, no, I don't think I'm going back to the classroom for now at least.  I would love to some day, but I'm ready to try a different angle of education.  
2:25 2:29 MALE:  So are you going into like policy or decision-making?  
2:25 2:28 FEMALE:  Probably non-profit work actually.  That's what I'm looking to do, but we'll see.  
2:33 2:33 MALE:  Oh, I see. 
2:30 2:33 FEMALE:  No job yet, but six weeks left to [unintelligible].  
2:38 2:39 MALE:  I'm sure you can find something.  
2:36 2:38 FEMALE:  So, you'll definitely be here for a while?  
2:42 2:53 MALE:  Actually, I'm second year, but I'm actually first year--like second-year but like first-year because I'm--like I'm taking a lot of different classes from different departments.  
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:55 2:58 MALE:  Just to satisfy my curiosity.  
2:54 2:59 FEMALE:  Cool.  So, you're here you might as well take advantage of--
3:04 3:05 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, it's such a great place.  
3:01 3:01 FEMALE:  It is.  
3:06 3:11 MALE:  And, uh, I've been doing like electrical engineering.  Actually, I did computer science and math before.  
3:07 3:08 FEMALE:  Okay.  
3:12 3:24 MALE:  And I was just bored with the details, kind of like Stanford is a great place to like explore other areas.  So, that's what I'm doing right now.  But officially I'm an EE.
3:22 3:32 FEMALE:  Okay, I--engineering is a little bit intimidating to me although my best friend from forever was an undergrad here and is finishing his Master's now in ME.  
3:36 3:36 MALE:  ME.
3:33 3:41 FEMALE: I hear about the things that he's doing, and it's absolutely so 180 degrees off [unintelligible] from how I spend my days.  
3:45 3:50 MALE:  That's different from--how is it different from education you think in engineering?  
3:46 4:13 FEMALE:  Definitely one of the biggest thing is that he understands how things work and is much more sort of, is--I feel like I talk about issues all day and talk about questions, and there are no answers.  And it's all about just sort of intellectual pursuit, exploring the issues that matter and not for engineering.  
4:17 4:17 MALE: I see.  
4:13 4:13 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
4:18 4:18 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
4:15 4:15 FEMALE:  Have fun tonight.  
4:20 4:20 MALE:  You too.
