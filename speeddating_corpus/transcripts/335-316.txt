  MALE: Say what?  Are you trying to play footsie with me?
0:16 0:18 FEMALE: No, I think that was all you.
  MALE: [unintelligible] 
0:18 0:20 FEMALE: Let's just be clear.
  MALE: [unintelligible] 
0:25 0:39 FEMALE: [laughter] You're distracting me from my survey.
0:00 0:03 MALE: Like, I can't even--I can't even--I'm distracting myself. 
0:40 0:42 FEMALE: [laughter] 
0:04 0:18 MALE: So frustrating.  I feel like I'm very extreme on these.  I've said this five times.  They're gonna [unintelligible] just recycling lines here, trying to buy time for myself.
0:57 0:58 FEMALE: Oh, uh--
0:20 0:22 MALE: [unintelligible] play footsie some more.
1:00 1:02 FEMALE: [laughter] 
0:31 0:34 MALE: We're not done yet, though.  We still have another one.  There's still four minutes to play footsie.
1:13 1:19 FEMALE: Oh, goodness.  Ah. Okay, I'm going to fill this out later because you're causing problems.
0:36 0:46 MALE: [unintelligible] about this lovely male that you just met. [unintelligible] 
1:22 1:26 FEMALE: Oh, [unintelligible] you're sabotaging your competition, by distracting the women?
0:49 0:55 MALE: No, I've already heard [unintelligible] from one of the girls previously.  What's your MO?
1:34 1:40 FEMALE: My MO?  I don't know that I have one.  I try to mix it up. I don't have one.
1:00 1:05 MALE: Oh, that's--that is bullshit.  That is absolute bullshit.  Everyone has an MO.  What is it?
1:44 1:46 FEMALE: I'm not sure exactly what [unintelligible].
1:07 1:10 MALE: What's your prerogative.  Bobby Brown said, "That's my prerogative."  What is your prerogative?
1:51 1:51 FEMALE: I really don't--
1:13 1:14 MALE: Do you--are you familiar with that song?
1:52 1:53 FEMALE: No. 
1:15 1:17 MALE: Whoa, you--how old are you?
1:54 1:59 FEMALE: [laughter] Uh, 23.  Is that a good excuse?
1:20 1:22 MALE: Dating me. Dating me. 
2:00 2:01 FEMALE: Oh, no. 
1:23 1:30 MALE: You, you really don't know the Bobby Brown song, "That's my prerogative?"  That's my prerogative.  Are you serious?
2:08 2:11 FEMALE: I have heard it, but I don't like--I know that line, but not more. 
1:36 1:42 MALE: You know that one line?  Do you know--are you familiar with [unintelligible] DeVeau [phonetic]?  No?
2:21 2:24 FEMALE: No. I know.  This is--maybe we just shouldn't talk.
1:44 1:47 MALE: What about--what about Crowded House.  We can just play footsie.  Yes.  
2:26 2:26 FEMALE: [laughter]. 
1:48 1:50 MALE: Crowded House?  Are you familiar with Crowded House?
2:30 2:34 FEMALE: No. [laughter] 
1:56 1:57 MALE: Is this uncomfortable?
2:35 2:38 FEMALE: No, it's not uncomfortable.  I just feel bad. 
1:59 1:59 MALE: [unintelligible] forward? 
2:38 2:39 FEMALE: No, I'm not leaning forward.
2:00 2:07 MALE: Uh, so anyways, so what are you--what do you really do?  Like, are you here just for kicks?  Fifth-year senior at Stanford, grad student? 
2:44 2:47 FEMALE: No, well.  Seventh year senior. 
2:08 2:11 MALE: Seventh year.  So you're going to be a Stanford for lifer?
2:50 2:53 FEMALE: I am.  Yeah, I was class of '02, and now I'm a PhD student.
2:15 2:15 MALE: In what?
2:54 2:55 FEMALE: In biology.
2:17 2:18 MALE: Oh, yeah?  So there's another one.
2:57 2:58 FEMALE: She's in my department.  Yeah.
2:20 2:21 MALE: nameX, right. 
2:59 3:01 FEMALE: Yeah, Clair.  I dragged her here. 
2:23 2:23 MALE: Really?
3:02 3:03 FEMALE: Yeah. So you have me to thank.
2:25 2:30 MALE: She actually said that she met a guy that she really liked earlier.  That you introduced her to before the thing started.
3:09 3:10 FEMALE: Oh, good. 
2:32 2:36 MALE: I was like, did you--I was like how did the four minute date go?  She's like [unintelligible]. 
3:15 3:16 FEMALE: Oh. 
2:37 2:40 MALE: So maybe there's potential there.  Do you think?  Potential?
3:17 3:18 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:40 2:44 MALE: Did you introduce them just because they're friends, or did you introduce people?
3:22 3:26 FEMALE: Well, I wanted--actually, I wanted the three of us to go out for a drink beforehand--
2:46 2:47 MALE: A threesome?
3:26 3:29 FEMALE: No, no, no. Because I wouldn't want to facilitate the meeting beforehand.
2:51 2:52 MALE: Oh, you wanted-- 
3:29 3:30 FEMALE: But she was working, and he was working. 
2:51 2:53 MALE: Oh, so you've been trying to work this out. 
3:31 3:34 FEMALE: No, I mean before tonight because I was thinking about it. 
2:54 2:59 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  But I mean you've been trying to get them together for a while.  Or do you have interest in him?
3:38 3:39 FEMALE: No.  No, he's a friend of mine from college, too.
3:01 3:02 MALE: Been there done there kind of thing?
3:40 3:42 FEMALE: No, just never went there. 
3:04 3:05 MALE: Yeah, never wanted to go there?
3:44 3:45 FEMALE: No. 
3:05 3:06 MALE: Yeah. 
3:46 3:48 FEMALE: Yeah.  Friend zone.  You know.
3:10 3:11 MALE: Yeah. I got you.
3:49 3:50 FEMALE: Uh, but this is something I've been doing a lot lately, is like--
3:12 3:12 MALE: Speed dating?
3:51 3:57 FEMALE: No, facilitating--not [unintelligible] it's actually been fun.  But facilitating people meeting and, uh, it's enjoyable.
3:17 3:19 MALE: Really?  So you're, like, a matchmaker?
3:58 3:59 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:20 3:23 MALE: Uh, what's that show, Miss Match?  What's that show that, uh, was with--
4:02 4:04 FEMALE: Miss Matched.  I really liked that show, and it got canceled.
3:25 3:27 MALE: I know.  It was fun wasn't it?  What's the woman's name?
4:06 4:08 FEMALE: Alicia Silverstone. Clueless?
3:29 3:31 MALE:  Of Clueless fame.  Right.  
4:09 4:10 FEMALE: Yes. 
3:32 3:34 MALE: Right.  So what have you thought of the Daves so far tonight?
4:14 4:21 FEMALE: You know, I was just thinking about how since elementary school, I have not been in a situation with, like, you know, nameX B. and nameX L. and stuff like that. 
3:42 3:42 MALE: [laughter]
4:21 4:22 FEMALE: So it was fun. 
3:43 3:45 MALE: So how was nameX K. and nameX R?
4:25 4:27 FEMALE: I think I enjoyed talking to all of the Daves. 
3:48 3:49 MALE: Really?
4:27 4:28 FEMALE: They were nice.  Yeah. 
3:49 3:50 MALE: How many Daves are there?  Two?
4:29 4:31 FEMALE: Three.  There's a nameX C. also.
3:51 3:53 MALE: Three? Who--I don't know the nameX C.
4:32 4:35 FEMALE: There's nameX C.  I liked nameX K. and nameX R. and nameX C. a lot.  They were nice. 
3:56 3:58 MALE: Really?  That's excellent.
4:36 4:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  Do you know them?
3:59 4:11 MALE: No, I just met them tonight.  We really hit it off.  On this thing where it said, you know, "Never met," I said, "Yes."  How long [unintelligible] seconds.  I said, "Yes, definitely." 
4:50 4:52 FEMALE: You're like, "Right away, I want to see you again.  I know." 
4:13 4:15 MALE: Done and done.  Done and done.
4:53 4:54 FEMALE: Um hm. 
4:16 4:18 MALE: Anyway.  And then you started off with nameX over here. 
4:57 4:58 FEMALE: I did.
4:19 4:24 MALE: I feel like my first few were not as good as the last ones. Because I feel like it took me a while--
5:02 5:04 FEMALE: I'll take that as a compliment.
4:25 4:33 MALE: Yeah.  I think--I think it's--but I also think maybe it took me a little while to get warmed up. 
5:12 5:13 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:33 4:40 MALE: So I think I kind of hit my stride on the backside of that wall and then coming through here, solid performance.
5:19 5:23 FEMALE: I hit a little well because the truth is, I tossed back a few before coming here. 
4:45 4:46 MALE: Really?
5:24 5:25 FEMALE: And so I was like--
4:47 4:47 MALE: So you sobered up?
5:26 5:28 FEMALE: I sobered up in the middle. But now I--
4:49 4:51 MALE: So you were drunk with nameX and sober with me. 
5:29 5:30 FEMALE: I was not drunk.
4:52 4:53 MALE: So disappointing.
5:31 5:33 FEMALE: [laughter].
4:54 4:56 MALE: But it's fun.  All right.  So are we done? 
5:35 5:36 FEMALE: We are. 
4:57 4:57 MALE: [unintelligible] 
5:37 5:39 FEMALE: That's it. Parting is such sweet sorrow.
5:02 5:04 MALE: It is. It really is.
5:41 5:43 FEMALE: [laughter] 
5:05 5:07 MALE: Was I flirtatious?  I guess I was.  I was playing footsie with you, right? 
5:47 5:50 FEMALE: You're distracting me, but now you're not trying to, so I'm kind of sad about that. 
5:12 5:17 MALE: We can meet up later if you want.  How assertive was I?  Was I assertive? 
5:57 5:58 FEMALE: [laughter]
