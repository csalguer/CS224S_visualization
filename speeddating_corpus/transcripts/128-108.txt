0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.  What do you do?
0:16 0:17 MALE:  Well, optimizers--
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Oh, we're starting again.

0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  I'm in earth sciences.  I do geophysics.  
0:34 0:40 MALE:  Oh, okay, and what kind--like do you--when do you expect the next earthquake in California is going to be?
0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  Oh, I don't do that kind of geophysics.  
0:42 0:43 MALE:  Okay.
0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  Next week though if, you know, hard-pressed.
0:45 0:47 MALE:  [laughter]  Yeah, so--
0:47 0:50 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I do environmental applications.  So, I do [unintelligible].  
0:50 0:56 MALE:  Okay, so you are pretty much going to be with the science background at least not from the [unintelligible] or things like that.
0:56 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, I have a [unintelligible] science background.
0:59 0:59 MALE:  Okay. 
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  In fact, I did engineering physics as my undergrad.
1:01 1:03 MALE:  Oh, okay, from where?
1:03 1:05 FEMALE:  From UBC, British Columbia.
1:05 1:10 MALE:  Okay, and so like how long have you been at Stanford?

3:18 3:19 MALE:  [interposing] Oh, yeah, I know.  
3:19 3:20 FEMALE:  The Core.
3:20 3:24 MALE:  The Day After Tomorrow is more--yeah, The Core.
