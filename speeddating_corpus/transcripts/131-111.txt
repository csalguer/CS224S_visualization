0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  That's crazy.  
0:48 0:50 MALE:  It's like kind of weird like, I don't know, have you been to a lot of weddings this [unintelligible]?

0:52 0:57 MALE:  Yeah, it's like [crosstalk] because like if people get married earlier or something.  
0:57 0:59 FEMALE:  I mean it's [unintelligible] the pit.  People that get married [unintelligible].  
1:00 1:24 MALE:  Right, right.  Yeah, it might be that like this one wedding is from this girl from high school who like I know she's really training to be a Presbyterian minister or something like that.  And I guess like it's some denomination where like she could get married or something.  But I haven't seen people in like four years or something.  I don't know.  I'm not sure what it will be like.  I'm going to New York for this.  I'm not sure.  It's sort of like--I feel like I should have been going.  But I don't know anyone who is going to be there.  
1:24 1:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, why are you even going?  
1:27 1:28 MALE:  Like just for the wedding or [unintelligible]?  
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  This summer.  
1:30 1:35 MALE:  Oh, that's a good question.  Actually, I'm not sure.  I applied to discover language programs in Middlebury, like in Vermont.  
1:35 1:37 FEMALE:  Wait, you're doing your vacation to Germany, right?  
1:38 1:41 MALE:  Yeah, part of it.  it's like Germany and the U.S. sort of economic history.  
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:42 1:52 MALE:  And I don't really know like I'm [unintelligible] come through that, but that's a pretty intensive five to six-week program for German [unintelligible].  Actually like [unintelligible] boring or something, but I'm actually looking forward to [unintelligible].  
1:52 1:53 FEMALE:  Language programs are great.  
1:54 1:59 MALE:  [unintelligible] language programs like beer, like connected, like it's great, but like I don't really ever like focus on learning, you know.  I'm always [unintelligible].  
2:00 2:03 FEMALE:  Unless you already know the language, it's kind of a waste of time.  There's nothing like--
2:03 2:04 MALE:  [interposing]  The only thing it does.  
2:04 2:08 FEMALE:  Unless you know the basics, there's nothing like immersion.  Like, you have be in the [unintelligible].  
2:08 2:17 MALE:  Like student [unintelligible] like people forgetting too much felt like being there like I think.  Although I was in Berlin over the summer, and like it will not help my German [unintelligible].  But, uh--
2:17 2:18 FEMALE:  All Germans speak English.  
2:18 2:23 MALE:  Yeah, not [unintelligible], but I'm trying to speak in my really bad German English, modern English, which is like way better than my English usually.  
2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  Do you speak Chinese?  
2:25 2:26 MALE:  A little bit.  Do you speak Chinese?  
2:27 2:34 FEMALE:  A little bit.  Not so much now.  Like I grew up not speaking it very well but hearing it around the house, and then I took it in college and spoke it actually fairly well in college.  
2:35 2:36 MALE:  You [unintelligible] at DX, right?  
2:36 2:38 FEMALE:  We were in--we were in that class together.  
2:38 2:40 MALE:  I know that--your lasso, and one lasso.  
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah [crosstalk].  
2:42 2:43 MALE:  I think we were in the same class.  
2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  We must have been, right?  
2:44 2:45 MALE:  Oh, man that class was so hard.  
2:46 2:48 FEMALE:  Because I don't think you were with me until HAR.  
2:48 2:49 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
2:49 2:51 FEMALE:  We might not have [unintelligible].  
2:52 2:59 MALE:  I was thinking--I had it Teusday/Thursday because remember like every Tuesday morning I'd get up and like read those flashcards on the way to like lecture, like--
3:00 3:01 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, I know, but I [unintelligible].  
3:02 3:05 MALE:  Yeah, it was like--I thought it was impossible.  I thought it was really hard anyway.  
3:05 3:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, actually that was like the [unintelligible] Freshman year.  
3:10 3:11 MALE:  I think it was on Xbox for me.

3:26 3:30 MALE:  Okay, okay, okay.  Oh, it doesn't matter if they don't get me.  I don't really care.  
3:31 3:32 FEMALE:  So much for science.  
3:32 3:32 MALE:  Yeah, well I mean what are they doing?  
3:33 3:39 FEMALE:  I think that's what they're going to tell us. Like I'm sure it's about like dating [unintelligible].  
3:40 3:43 MALE:  Right, right.  [unintelligible] people make judgments about each other.  
3:44 3:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  I read actually the most interesting article in the New York Times about this woman, old Jewish lady who actually--
3:51 3:53 MALE:  [interposing]  I read this article too.  She was like this formula--
3:54 3:56 FEMALE:  And like apparently it's so easy.  It's actually [unintelligible] look kind of alike.  
3:57 4:05 MALE:  Right, and they're all kind of like in their mid-thirties or something like that.  I'm like [unintelligible] career and this is sort of like everyone's like Jewish mother like that.
