00:00 00:01 FEMALE: Hi.  
00:01 00:01 MALE: Hi.  
00:02 00:02 FEMALE: female331.
00:03 00:04 MALE: nameX, male309 [phonetic]
00:04 00:04 FEMALE: male309?
00:05 00:05 MALE: Yes.  
00:05 00:05 FEMALE: Cool.  
00:05 00:06 MALE: How are you doing?  
00:06 00:07 FEMALE: This is K, station K. 
00:09 00:17 MALE: All right.  Uh, where's the--I'm assuming you're a student here, right?  
00:17 00:17 FEMALE: Yes.  
00:18 00:18 MALE: What do you study here?  
00:19 00:22 FEMALE: Uh, English.  I'm in the Ph.D. program in English.  Are you business school?  
00:23 00:23 MALE: No, not at all.  
00:23 00:23 FEMALE: What are you doing?  
00:24 00:25 MALE: Material sciences.  
00:25 00:26 FEMALE: You're MSE?  
00:25 00:26 MALE: Yeah.  
00:26 00:28 FEMALE: It's a one year program or no?  
00:28 00:33 MALE: No, no, no.  It's, uh, Material Science and Engineering [unintelligible] lasts typically takes, like, five years.  
00:33 00:40 FEMALE: Oh, like my program.  That's five years, too.  Okay.  I know someone who's doing MSE but he's only doing one year.  Is there a Master's Program?  
00:40 00:41 MALE: Yeah.  
00:41 00:42 FEMALE: nameX [unintelligible].  
00:43 00:50 MALE: Uh, with an MSE--there are two MSEs actually.  There is a management science and engineering with [unintelligible] which is also part MSE.  
00:51 00:53 FEMALE: Maybe [unintelligible] [laughter] I don't know, I don't know.  
00:53 00:54    MALE:  Yeah.  Right.  Get confused sometimes.  
00:55 00:58 FEMALE: Well, never mind.  I don't know somebody then.  Yeah.  So you're what year?  
01:00 01:00 MALE: Fifth.  
01:01 01:03 FEMALE: Your fifth.  How many more years do you have--
01:04 01:04 MALE: Only one year.  
01:04 01:16 FEMALE: One more year, yeah.  They do the same thing for us.  We have five years and then a first year but some people, usually people take another year, sixth year, sometimes seventh years.  You know, you hear stories, like, eighth years, ninth years.  They just call them advanced.  
01:17 01:17 MALE: [laughter].  
01:18 01:19 FEMALE: After fifth year you're advanced.  
01:20 01:21 MALE: [laughter]  Okay.  
01:20 01:28 FEMALE: You're not--no more numbers.  So what do, like, what are you going to do with--are you going to work for, like, a company or--well, I don't know anything about MSEs.  I don't know.  
01:29 01:35 MALE: Yeah, uh, I, yeah.  Um, well, actually, I'm--I'm okay with either industry or academia.  
01:35 01:36 FEMALE: Oh, so you might want to go into academia?  
01:37 01:38 MALE: Yeah, probably.    
01:38 01:38 FEMALE: To be a professor?  
01:39 01:39 MALE: Yes.  
01:39 01:51 FEMALE: How's that?  Because I know, like, for me, like there's not really industry for English.  So, like, for me it's basically being a professor.  But the job market is, you know, it's not great because there's so many people who have Ph.D.s and not that many jobs.  How is it for you guys?  
01:53 01:55 MALE: Yeah, probably--assume everything's about the same.  
01:54 02:03 FEMALE: Really?  There should be more, though, because it's like a technical--like, English is more, you know, cool, but it's not very, like, [unintelligible] so I'd think there would be more room for you guys.  
02:05 02:11 MALE: Uh, there's many more--more graduates--more new grads than the open positions.  
02:10 02:10 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
02:11 02:13 MALE: So that's probably true for any discipline.  [laughter] 
02:13 02:17 FEMALE: That's true.  It's true.  I mean, do you want to be a professor?  Would you rather--
02:18 02:21 MALE: Um, I actually don't have preference.  
02:19 02:19 FEMALE: Really?  
02:22   02:29  MALE: I'm okay with either one, yeah.  Because doing Academia is good, but, uh, the first seven years is very rough.  
02:27 02:28 FEMALE: Before you get tenure?  
02:29 02:34 MALE: Before you get tenure is very rough.  So by the time you get tenure you are close to 40.  
02:33 02:33 FEMALE: I know, I know.
02:35 02:38 MALE: That's probably the reason--probably half of your life already.  
02:36 02:38 FEMALE: I know.  [laughter] .  
02:39 02:45 MALE: So I'm not sure I want to do that.  But on the other hand, if you get tenure, the life afterwards is very great.  
02:45 02:49 FEMALE: I know, like, you have summer vacation--I mean, he doesn't have to do research.  You have summer vacations and--
02:51 02:52 MALE: And time is very flexible, yeah.  
02:52 03:02 FEMALE: You don't have to go nine to five.  You know, you could work late at night or on the weekend--I actually don't mind working on the weekend.  I just don't like having to go somewhere nine to five.  I don't know, very boring.  [unintelligible] 
03:05 03:06 MALE: So where are you from?  
03:05 03:06 FEMALE: Um, I'm from Northern California.  
03:07 03:08 MALE: Northern California?  
03:07 03:09 FEMALE: Like, um, Chico.  Do you know where that is?  
03:13 03:13 MALE: No.  
03:10 03:10 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's a small town.  
03:13 03:13 MALE: To the north of San Francisco?  
03:13 03:14 FEMALE: North of Sacramento.  
03:14 03:15 MALE: North of Sacramento.  
03:15 03:17 FEMALE: Very, [unintelligible].
03:16 03:17 MALE: North of Sacramento.  Oh, I see.  
03:17 03:19 FEMALE: Small town, yes.  I went to high school there.  
03:21 03:22 MALE: So where did you do your undergrad then?    
03:21 03:22 FEMALE: Oh, my undergrad at UCLA.  
03:24 03:24 MALE: UCLA. 
03:23 03:25 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And where did you do your undergrad?  
03:26 03:27 MALE: In China.  
03:26 03:26 FEMALE: Where in China?  
03:28 03:28 MALE: [unintelligible].  
03:28 03:28 FEMALE: Really.  
03:30 03:31 MALE: [unintelligible] University.  
03:29 03:31 FEMALE: Do you speak, uh, Cantonese or Mandarin?  
03:32 03:33 MALE: Mandarin.  
03:32 03:38 FEMALE: Mandarin.  Because the only thing I know is that my landlord is Chinese.  It's like [Chinese phrase].  
03:38 03:39 MALE: [laughter] 
03:37 03:40 FEMALE: [laughter]  But, I don't know if that's Cantonese or Mandarin.  
03:41 03:42 MALE: That's Mandarin.  
03:41 03:42 FEMALE: It's, like [Chinese phrase].  
03:43 03:43 MALE: Yeah.  That's Mandarin.  
03:43 03:45 FEMALE: [Chinese phrase.] [laughter] 
03:46 03:47 MALE: [laughter] 
03:47 03:56 FEMALE: See, I know a little bit.  So I know, yeah, that's to show off my very pathetic Chinese but that's all that I know, so.  But you speak English very well.  Did you study English in China?  
03:58 04:02 MALE: Yeah, yeah, from, uh, starting from 11 years old.  
04:00 04:00 FEMALE: Really?  
04:02 04:02 MALE: Yeah.  
04:01 04:02 FEMALE: Wow.  That's good.  
04:04 04:05 MALE: Thank you.  
04:03 04:05 FEMALE: I mean, that's a lot of study, but...good.  
04:08 04:08 MALE: All right.  
04:06 04:08 FEMALE: Okay.  Lovely to meet you.  
04:09 04:09 MALE: Form.
