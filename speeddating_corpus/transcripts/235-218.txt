0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  Do you want some water?  

0:10 0:15 MALE:  I've got some right here.  I just -- I moved a little bit too quickly.  How's it going I'm male218?  

0:13 0:16 FEMALE:  Have some water.  I'll have water too [laughter].  

0:17 0:18 MALE:  Okay, that's a good plan.  

0:21 0:24 FEMALE:  I know, you got to get [unintelligible].  What is that like?  

0:27 0:31 MALE:  Right, [unintelligible] coughing, no one likes that.  So, how are you doing?  

0:29 0:33 FEMALE:  I'm good.  I'm, you know, sitting.  I've gone to the bathroom [unintelligible] a bathroom break.  

0:36 0:38 MALE:  Yeah I had to make a bathroom break too.  We're on the second floor too.  

0:36 0:37 FEMALE:  I know.  

0:39 0:40 MALE:  I got lost like somewhere back there in the hallway.  

0:38 0:40 FEMALE:  Well no, that's a -- there's a guy's bathroom over there.  

0:42 0:43 MALE:  Yeah that's what I heard later.  

0:41 0:43 FEMALE:  Oh [laughter] that's the way it always happens.  

0:45 0:51 MALE:  But [unintelligible] more information, but it's a little bit too late to exactly use it.  

0:49 0:52 FEMALE:  That's right, but you know for the knowledge or for the future.  

0:54 0:55 MALE:  Right for the future, right the next time I'm --  

0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  Yeah [laughter].  

0:57 0:58 MALE:  -- strapped up to a recorder and at this.  

0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  I know [laughter].  

0:59 1:08 MALE:  It's funny though, right, like with these things, it's like my brain can't figure out if I'm at a bar or like taking SAT and so it keeps like flashing between the two of them.  

1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

1:09 1:12 MALE:  Like filling out blanks, like it's very -- [unintelligible] experience.  

1:10 1:12 FEMALE:  [laughter] you can always [unintelligible] my name again.  

1:15 1:21 MALE:  Exactly, exactly yeah.  I mean I feel like I know -- I'll remember people's names way better than mine.  So what is it that you do?  

1:19 1:22 FEMALE:  I'm in the Ed School, which is why I know where the men's bathroom is, so --  

1:24 1:25 MALE:  Ed School.  Okay yeah.  

1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  So I know this building.  

1:26 1:27 MALE:  That is really cool.  

1:25 1:27 FEMALE:  Going to the bathroom is really very cool.  

1:30 1:35 MALE:  That's a very useful skill as I've already found out.  And is it just a one year program that you're in?  

1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  Three quarters, so almost done.  

1:37 1:40 MALE:  Yeah they really, I guess, fly you guys through it pretty quickly.  

1:38 1:43 FEMALE:  In and out, in and out so we'll see if that is good or not.  I'm going to look for a job.  

1:46 1:51 MALE:  So the first one people really ask is if you want to become a teacher, but not a lot of people from the Ed School really go into teaching.  

1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  No.  

1:52 1:52 MALE:  Right?  

1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  Right.  

1:52 1:56 MALE:  That's the interesting thing.  So what are you interested in becoming if not a teacher?  

1:54 2:30 FEMALE:  I think look for other, other ed programs that are based in research.  I mean that spans like everything and anything like having to do with [unintelligible].  I mean you can do like anthropology of ed, economics of ed, like philosophy, you know, any kind, whatever you want, which is why I wanted to come here because it's so flexible.  So right now like I'm working for like Asian American like high school females, high school aged females and so I guess [unintelligible] use their like adult learning.  That was really terrible and big answer, but that's what -- it can be whatever you want it to be basically.  

2:32 2:39 MALE:  No it sounds pretty good, I mean but it must be interesting to have people right away assume that you're going to go commit your life to teaching somewhere.  

2:36 2:41 FEMALE:  No it's very true, every, almost every person asks me like what are you teaching or do you want to teach or what not.  

2:43 2:46 MALE:  Yeah.  And I do, I do Russian literature --  

2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Oh you do?  

2:46 2:56 MALE:  -- and the first question is always, like why do you do the Russian literature and I still haven't managed to come up with a really clever answer to answer that.  But I teach like Russian here and I do --  

2:54 2:56 FEMALE:  Are you CA or you actually [unintelligible]?  

2:58 2:59 MALE:  Oh I teach like I'm hands-on.  

2:58 2:58 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  

3:01 3:01 MALE:  Yeah.  

2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  Cool.  

3:01 3:11 MALE:  They've actually entrusted an entire group of 10 students to my care of Russian too even.  And so, yeah.  But yeah they're very daring people.  

3:09 3:13 FEMALE:  Wow.  Do you know, I saw a girl, nameX [phonetic], do you know her in Russian lit?  

3:15 3:16 MALE:  nameX, yeah she's sitting over there.  

3:14 3:17 FEMALE:  Okay yeah, yeah, yeah I remember she's a Russian lit student.  

3:19 3:22 MALE:  Yeah, yeah she's in my group.  She's a first year, I'm a third year.  

3:20 3:21 FEMALE:  Okay.  

3:23 3:25 MALE:  So I sort of watch over her and make sure she doesn't get into any trouble.  

3:24 3:25 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

3:27 3:39 MALE:  That's our joke is, because we were sort of like awkwardly mixing with other people who are sort of milling around before this entire thing started.  So why did you get into education?  

3:38 3:40 FEMALE:  That's a good question too because I didn't have --  

3:42 3:43 MALE:  Yes isn't it?  I mean --  

3:41 3:44 FEMALE:  No, but in [unintelligible] it's very natural right how you start.  

3:48 3:50 MALE:  Especially when you're surrounded by people every day in and day out it's the exact same thing.  

3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  Exactly and you're like, don't you know.  

3:52 3:56 MALE:  Right and you end up in like a speed date thing and like absolutely everyone was asking why you went into education and all of a sudden --  

3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  And you're like what?  

3:56 3:57 MALE:  -- like you need the answer right.  

3:56 4:04 FEMALE:  I don't know.  Well I think in general, I feel like people who are in education like are very sensitive to like you know issues of social justice, equality, [unintelligible].  

4:06 4:08 MALE:  Like environments too that people find themselves in.  

4:06 4:11 FEMALE:  Right and so it's kind of a natural like gravitation [unintelligible].  Anyway, all right nice meeting you.  

4:13 4:14 MALE:  Wow that was very quick.  female235, nice to meet you.  

4:12 4:14 FEMALE:  I hope you feel better now [laughter] don't choke anymore.  

4:16 4:20 MALE:  Yeah.  I think that water really helped.  I think they're going to start punishing us if we don't move quickly.  

4:17 4:19 FEMALE:  I know [laughter] bye.
