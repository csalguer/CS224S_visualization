0:04 0:12 MALE:  I'm going to kill her.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  

0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  Hi.  

0:14 0:14 MALE:  It's a blank page.  

0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  What?  

0:16 0:16 MALE:  Blank pages.  

0:15 0:15 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  

0:19 0:20 MALE:  I'm so confused.  Wait a minute.  

0:22 0:22 FEMALE:  Oh, but --  

0:26 0:26 MALE:  Are we supposed to have a break?  

0:25 0:25 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

0:30 0:31 MALE:  Okay.  Hang on, wait a minute.  

0:28 0:29 FEMALE:  I have to [unintelligible] too.  

0:33 0:41 MALE:  P.  I'm so losing track as soon as I moved, I need to write it down.  Anyway, how are you?  I'm male205, it's nice to meet you.  

0:38 0:38 FEMALE:  I'm female236.  Nice to meet you.    

0:44 0:45 MALE:  How are you doing tonight?

0:51 0:52 MALE:  Oh yeah?  Okay.  

0:50 0:53 FEMALE:  [laughter] so I'm not going to talk much [laughter].  

0:56 1:08 MALE:  Okay so here's a good question.  So when I get bored in a situation like this, not that I've been in speed dating before, but if I meet someone and I'm never going to see them again and I just don't care, I lie.  

1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  Lie what?  

1:10 1:28 MALE:  I lie a lot.  I lie about what I do, I lie about my name, I can't like about my name because I have a name tag, but I lie about what I do, where I'm from, what I'm going to be doing next year, what I'm going to be doing later today, so let's make up a lie.  So what are you studying?  

1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  Wow, computer science.  

1:33 1:43 MALE:  You can do better than that, come on, how about what's like the furthest thing that you could -- how about something that nobody in the room would know anything about?  Computer science.  Okay how about --  

1:41 1:45 FEMALE:  Because lots of guys come here, [unintelligible] electrical engineering.  

1:48 1:50 MALE:  All right you study particle physics.  

1:49 1:51 FEMALE:  I never [unintelligible].  

1:54 1:54 MALE:  Okay.  

1:51 1:54 FEMALE:  I've never [unintelligible] I can't do that.  [unintelligible].  

1:57 2:06 MALE:  Nobody is going to be able to ask you any questions about it, trust me.  They don't know anything about it, although I think there's a few engineers.  Okay, where are you from?  

2:04 2:08 FEMALE:  Well I'm from Japan.  

2:12 2:22 MALE:  Okay.  They might believe that.  Okay we'll move on.  What are you doing when you graduate?  How long until you graduate?  

2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  Six years.  

2:26 2:27 MALE:  Okay and what are you doing when you graduate?  

2:26 2:34 FEMALE:  I'm going to be, I'm going to go to China and --  

2:37 2:37 MALE:  Okay.  

2:36 2:39 FEMALE:  And start up a company [laughter].  

2:43 2:51 MALE:  Doing what?  This is good, we've got to work on the lie though.  All right so if you're studying particle physics, then you're going to China to start a --  

2:50 2:57 FEMALE:  I'll do things like I really don't have that much ambition for my whole lifetime [unintelligible] to talk about.  

3:01 3:18 MALE:  Sure.  We can work with it.  All right, you're going to start a company to maintain nuclear reactors.  I don't know, that could work.  I don't know enough about particle physics.  

3:15 3:17 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] top secret.  

3:21 3:32 MALE:  Exactly.  You're taking your Stanford education and you're going to another country and you're sending us industry there.  Excellent, I like it.  Okay we can work with it.  What do you do for fun?  

3:32 3:37 FEMALE:  Nothing very special, watch movies and listen to music.  

3:40 3:55 MALE:  All right, so let's work on that.  You are a champion water skier, yeah we can go with that.  And let's see, oh you ballroom dance.  

3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  No.  

3:57 4:24 MALE:  Why not?  You can work with it, nobody is going to know, nobody is going to be able to call you out on it.  Okay let's go over it, so you're studying particle physics, you're graduating this year, you're originally from Japan, and you're going to go to China to setup a company and you do water skiing and you're a champion water skier and you ballroom dance.  I like it, okay good.  We can work with that.  Okay good.  

4:20 4:22 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

4:27 4:32 MALE:  That was a quick date I think.  Yeah.  I hate that horn.  Okay good, we're going to work on that.
