0:01 0:02 MALE: So, you're female332, hi.
0:04 0:04 FEMALE: Yes.
0:02 0:03 MALE: Hi, I'm male311.
0:05 0:05 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:03 0:05 MALE: Let me just write your name down here, so.
0:07 0:09 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.  [laughter]
0:07 0:09 MALE: So uh, so what are you studying here?
0:12 0:14 FEMALE: Um, I'm in the biology department.  
0:12 0:15 MALE: Oh, really?  Okay.  Wow.  What- what type of biology do you study?
0:18 0:19 FEMALE: Uh, plant biology.
0:17 0:17 MALE: Okay.
0:19 0:21 FEMALE: Um, particularly global change biology.
0:19 0:24 MALE: Is that- is that different from botany, or is that the same thing?
0:24 0:24 FEMALE: Um.
0:23 0:24 MALE: Pretend I'm like clueless.
0:24 0:26 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:24 0:26 MALE: It's not far from the truth.  [laughter]
0:27 0:31 FEMALE: No, that's cool, that's cool.  Um, botany is more like--
0:30 0:31 MALE: Classification?  No.
0:33 0:47 FEMALE: Classification, systematics, and like uh like whole plant arrangement, and what I study is more physiologic responses of plants to- to external things.
0:44 1:02 MALE: Okay, wow.  So that's like a pretty interesting field.  I know, like I have a few friends who uh, who they live in other countries, but they have like plantations and stuff, and they like, one of them's trying to uh grow these uh, what do you call those- the trees, palm trees.
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
1:03 1:06 MALE: Palm trees, and they sell for like $20,000 apiece.  
1:08 1:13 FEMALE: So they're selling them like as- as nursery, like you sell the whole plant, not- not for like coconuts or anything?
1:12 1:13 MALE: No, they just sell 'em and then--
1:14 1:15 FEMALE: Oh, okay.
1:14 1:19 MALE: They grow in the Middle East, I don't know where.  They grow 'em, they don't sell 'em for $20,000.  By the time it gets over here it's $20,000--
1:21 1:21 FEMALE: Right.
1:20 1:28 MALE: Or $10,000 dollars.  So, but uh, and so it's just fascinating how they set up all the irrigation and all the funky stuff.  It's sort of, I don't know anything about it, so--
1:30 1:35 FEMALE: Well, for palm trees, you shouldn't really need that much irrigation, I mean they're, they're desert things to begin with.
1:32 1:33 MALE: Yeah, that's true.
1:35 1:39 FEMALE: But huh.  So how do you- how do you know [unintelligible] for palm trees.
1:36 1:45 MALE: Well, so I'm a, I'm, this is my second degree, I did a MBA here, and so-- in the MBA program they have lots of international students in there.
1:47 1:47 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
1:45 1:54 MALE: And so, well that's one of the great things about getting to meet all these people from all over the world, and then, you know, you-- they become your friends and you have instantly, all these places to stay.  [laughter]  You know, when you go traveling.
1:57 1:57 FEMALE: Right, yeah.  
1:55 1:57 MALE: So, now I'm in the electrical engineering program.
1:59 2:00 FEMALE: Oh, okay.
1:58 2:08 MALE: And so, um but, so I, you know, I meet all these people that are doing all these crazy things from, you know, like shrimp farming to like, you know, technology, to I mean, growing trees.
2:11 2:11 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, awesome.
2:10 2:17 MALE: So [laughter] so it's sort of interesting.  But uh, so what- what got you into um, botany.  Biology.
2:18 2:29 FEMALE: Um.  It [laughter] I used to uh work for ecologists in the summers, when I was in, when I was in college.  Um.  And it was just, it was great, it was fun.  I really enjoyed it.
2:28 2:29 MALE: And that's where you studied undergrad?
2:31 2:33 FEMALE: I- I studied math as an undergrad.
2:31 2:32 MALE: Oh, you did, wow.
2:34 2:34 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:33 2:35 MALE: That's pretty like, is it, pretty different, I'd assume.
2:38 2:39 FEMALE: It's more similar than you might think.  
2:38 2:38 MALE: Really?
2:40 2:51 FEMALE: Um, I mean, it's all, it's all science, like I'm excited about science, and that's- that's why I ended up in this field.  Um, and you know, most people, when they come to grad school and biology have to take a lot of math.
2:50 2:50 MALE: Yeah.
2:52 2:53 FEMALE: So, you know.
2:51 2:55 MALE: That's true, that's true, like math is killing me in some of my classes.
2:57 2:57 FEMALE: Oh, really.
2:56 3:13 MALE: It's like, I took this class on vision and imaging systems, and you think vision, okay, you're just like seeing something.  Forget it, there's like these crazy uh, um, transformation things, and uh, I'm like, I don't have a, an engineering undergrad degree, so I'm totally lost half the time.  So I'm like--
3:16 3:17 FEMALE: What- what is your undergrad degree?
3:15 3:18 MALE: It's in uh, it's in uh, quantitative economics.  
3:20 3:21 FEMALE: Oh, okay, cool.
3:19 3:22 MALE: It's uh, totally different from what I'm doing now.  So.
3:23 3:26 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, so what- what got you into going to-- 
3:24 3:29 MALE: Oh, in San-- well I told you, well, the funny thing is, they told me that I had a snowballs chance in hell of getting in.
3:31 3:32 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:30 3:34 MALE: So I just like applied, just out of spite, just to piss 'em off.  Yeah, and so--
3:36 3:37 FEMALE: And then you decided to come.
3:36 3:39 MALE: Well, no, no, yeah, yeah, no, I-- well, I really actually did want to go.  
3:41 3:41 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:39 3:49 MALE: But you know, it's like, no one can tell me I can't do something.  So, you know, I studied the GRE, I got every single book around, and then you know, you know, did well on that.  
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
3:50 3:55 MALE: And went from there, so. It's been a very challenging thing, as you can imagine, not having any of the background, so-- 
[horn]
3:58 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:56 3:59 MALE: So.  Well, it was nice meeting you.
4:00 4:01 FEMALE: Right, nice to meet you.
