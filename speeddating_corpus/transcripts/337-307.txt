0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  Oh, I thought [unintelligible].

0:01 0:03 MALE:  [unintelligible] it sounds like--

0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  Is it break time or [unintelligible]?

0:08 0:12 MALE:  Uh, you skipped two pages [unintelligible] what station?

0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  I'm--I'm female337.  I'm 

0:13 0:14 MALE:  female337, I'm male307.

0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  I'm Station Q.

0:15 0:17 MALE:  I'm Station Q.  Nice to meet you Station Q.

0:20 0:20 FEMALE:  So--

0:20 0:21 MALE:  How are you doing?

0:22 0:25 FEMALE:  I'm good.  Are you one of the business school guy, I assume?

0:25 0:26 MALE:  I am.  How did you guess?

0:27 0:32 FEMALE:  Well, 'cause I--the first few guys that I met they're all, oh, yeah, we came together.  So, I figured you must be one of them too.

0:32 0:41 MALE:  That's funny.  It wasn't coordinated at least by me, but it's just--I guess it's the type of thing that business school people are comfortable trying.

0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, 'cause--

0:41 0:44 MALE:  Being outgoing and just, you know, trying to meet people.

0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  Meet people networking.

0:45 0:45 MALE:  Yeah.

0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  Are you first year, second year?

0:46 0:46 MALE:  I'm a second year.

0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  So, are you almost done?

0:48 0:50 MALE:  I am almost done.  I am very sad.

0:50 0:52 FEMALE:  Really?  Oh, like a vacation--

0:52 0:52 MALE:  Yeah.

0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  --as one of them pointed out.

0:54 0:54 MALE:  Yeah.

0:55 0:58 FEMALE:  So, really--like MBA is not too [unintelligible] load?

0:58 1:10 MALE:  I'd say, um, it's probably--it can be at times, but it's--it's so discretionary.  It's more like if you want to.  If you work--if you don't want to do anything, you could--you could pass this place doing mostly nothing.

1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  Wow.

1:11 1:13 MALE:  But no one does that, I mean, it does take a lot of money to be here, so--

1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  That's true.

1:14 1:16 MALE:  --you certainly like try to make the most of it. 

1:17 1:17 FEMALE:  That's true.

1:18 1:24 MALE:  So, I'd say I've had times where I've been really busy and then times when I haven't been.  Right now I happen to be on one of those [unintelligible] super busy, so it's--

1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

1:25 1:28 MALE:  --it's a little bit, uh, [unintelligible] where it's kind of rough.

1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  And I assume you worked like a few years before you came here?

1:31 1:31 MALE:  Yeah.  

1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  That's right.

1:32 1:36 MALE:  I was working for two years in New York and then two years out I San Francisco.

1:36 1:38 FEMALE:  I see.  So, like school is like so much like a break time for you?

1:39 1:39 MALE:  Yes.

1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  That's nice.

1:40 1:41 MALE:  You can say that.  This has been nice.

1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  So, what's your plan after this?

1:43 1:47 MALE:  Um, working on starting a business, uh, with a classmate of mine.

1:47 1:49 FEMALE:  Oh, [unintelligible] sounds interesting.

1:49 1:56 MALE:  Yeah.  It should be fun.  It's pretty scary, I mean, everything I've done so far has been, you know, going to work for somebody--

1:56 1:56 FEMALE:  Not [unintelligible].

1:57 2:00 MALE:  --great, you know, somebody with a great reputation it was very safe [unintelligible].

2:00 2:01 FEMALE:  Structured.

2:01 2:05 MALE:  Just kind of see what we can do, so deciding is scary.

2:05 2:08 FEMALE:  Well, you may as well try when you're young, right?

2:08 2:08 MALE:  Exactly.

2:09 2:11 FEMALE:  That would be fun.  So, what kind of business are you and your friend thinking about?

2:12 2:15 MALE:  Um, it's--it's kind of preventive health care.

2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:16 2:25 MALE:  Um, so we're trying to create a program to help, um, individuals with, you know, stress management, smoking sensation, nutrition, fitness--

2:25 2:25 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

2:26 2:30 MALE:  --and offer it to employers so they can offer it to their employees.

2:30 2:32 FEMALE:  So, it's like consulting or not, no?

2:32 2:38 MALE:  It's not consulting so much as, um, it's kind of like being a [unintelligible] intervention, coaching.

2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

2:39 2:40 MALE:  So--

2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  It will be interesting.

2:41 2:43 MALE:  [unintelligible].  What about you?

2:43 2:51 FEMALE:  Well, I--I study bacteria, so--well, hopefully after this I will be looking for a job in one of those like companies--biotech companies though.

2:52 2:54 MALE:  Like Gentech or something like that or...?

2:54 2:58 FEMALE:  Any--anything is good like big, small.  I don't really mind as long as--just finding a job is not quite easy.

2:59 3:00 MALE:  Really?  Is it a tough time right now?

3:00 3:13 FEMALE:  Well, I think it's going up a little bit more I think then just like down for like quite a few years.  But I heard things are picking up.  But it's still not easy because most of my connections are in Academia, so I don't really know people in commercial [unintelligible].

3:13 3:17 MALE:  Yeah.  And your academic connections don't know people is that what [unintelligible]?

3:17 3:25 FEMALE:  Um, not a whole lot that's why it's hard.  And--or people I know will be on the East Coast and they say, oh, too bad I don't know anybody out there.  So, it's--

3:25 3:26 MALE:  And you want to stay out here?

3:26 3:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, I like--I prefer to stay in the Bay Area--

3:27 3:28 MALE:  Yeah.

3:28 3:30 FEMALE:  Just because the weather is so nice, you just can't beat it.

3:31 3:32 MALE:  Yeah, I agree.  I love it here.

3:32 3:33 FEMALE:  Are you planning on--planning on staying in the Bay Area too?

3:33 3:34 MALE:  Yeah.  

3:34 3:37 FEMALE:  It just looks so nice because I was in the Midwest for eight years.

3:37 3:37 MALE:  Where were you?

3:38 3:44 FEMALE:  Wisconsin, Michigan.  Wisconsin for under grad and then Michigan for grad school and it's like this is it.  No more snow for me.

3:45 3:46 MALE:  So, what grad school did you go to in Michigan?

3:46 3:47 FEMALE:  University of Michigan.
