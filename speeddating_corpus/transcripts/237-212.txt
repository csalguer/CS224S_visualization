00:01  00:01	MALE:  [horn] Just in time.
00:03  00:04	FEMALE:  [laughter]
00:05  00:05	MALE:  So, female237?
00:06  00:06	FEMALE:  Yes, female237.  Right.
00:07  00:07	MALE:  I'm male212.  Nice to meet you.
00:08  00:09	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
00:10  00:13	MALE:  So, um, tell me about yourself.  How it's seems it's the order the order of the evening.
00:14  00:16	FEMALE:  Exactly.  Ah, well, I'm a student at the Ed School.  And --
00:17  00:17	MALE:  All these people are in the Ed School.
00:18  00:24	FEMALE:  All, I know, they probably have us all lined up, so you're like oh my god another one of them [laughter].
00:25  00:26	MALE:  So what's your area in Education then?
00:26  00:29	FEMALE:  Um, so sort of like History and Philosophy of Education.
00:30  00:31	MALE:  Oh, really.  That's cool.
00:31  00:33	FEMALE:  Yeah, so I don't do like practical things at all [laughter].
00:34  00:37	MALE:  I was a History Major as an undergrad so I have a fine appreciation for the history education.
00:38  00:39	FEMALE:  Right.  There you go.
00:40  00:44	MALE:  There was actually a class on it.  I thought about taking it, but never quite got around to it.
00:45  00:45	FEMALE:  That's all right [laughter].
00:46  00:49	MALE:  What's your favorite historical period for education or we in like the best of times or --?
00:50  01:19	FEMALE:  Oh, we're never in the best of times.  Education is all about like how terrible every time period is.  Like, I mean, the people in the time period always think their time period is terrible.  And it's time to do -- I mean, that's why you have the history of school reform, there's always a reform going on.  Like, yeah.  So there's no like -- I don't know maybe the medieval period thought they were like really great.  They have their university and they were doing well.  With no concept of you know, needing to educate the masses yet.  So, a little better off in that sense, but.
01:20  01:29	MALE:  That's cool.  Yeah, I'm more in management science and engineering.  I almost take it took a class in education this quarter there's one like, through the Business School on like the Politics of Education.
01:30  01:31	FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, yeah, Krist -- 
01:32  01:39	MALE:  Exactly.  But I've always sort of been interested in like your second language acquisition and sort of like educational policy and things like that.
01:40  01:41	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So how did you get into MS&E?
01:41  01:55	MALE:  Well, you know, coming out of my psych and new history undergrad [laughter].  Like MS&E is like two areas you can do like sort engineering or you can do like organizational behavior and like sort of like human resource management and stuff.  So that's more of what I'm in.
01:56  01:56	FEMALE:  Okay
01:57  02:08	MALE:  I'm more of people person that doesn't really care what the most sufficient supply chain is.  It's nice enough; you know I only have to spend a year at it.  So -- um, get in and get out.
02:09  02:13	FEMALE:  So is there a certain kind of like company or whatever that you study or?
02:14  02:18	MALE:  Well that I study; I guess we basically pray to the gods of Silicon Valley in this program.
02:19  02:21	FEMALE:  Oh, I see [laughter].
02:22  02:38	MALE:  We're all in this like useless trivia or like random facts of how different people do different things.  It's sort of interesting, but I mean one of my projects is like on Sun Microsystems last year and I still barely know what they do, or like do I really care.
02:39  02:39	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:40  02:46	MALE:  It's sort of nice, but I mean like we do other things like I met with Jack Welsh, the GE guy when he came to campus last week. 
02:47  02:47	FEMALE:  Cool. 
02:48  02:51	MALE:  It is cool. I'm more focused on like the Disney side of things.  I would really like to work for the Disney Company.
02:52  02:53	FEMALE:  Oh really.  So what would you want to do there?
02:54  03:06	MALE:  Um, well I guess -- ideally they have an Imagineering department where you actually design rides and work with that.  But I mean anything that enables me to interact with guests and sort of to make kids happy.
03:07  03:10	FEMALE:  So you would like to like on the ground interacting with people and not just --
03:11  03:22	MALE:  At least initially, I mean although I have the height for the Goofy suit but I don't see that as my life's calling especially with a Masters Degree.  So, it's -- I sent out some applications so we'll see how they come out.
03:23  03:29	FEMALE:  Are there specific jobs to apply for or is it you just send them an app and see if they respond?
03:30  03:39	MALE:  Well, half and half.  They came to campus last year and they were like we're only looking for undergraduates in this one program.  And I'm like undergraduate, I have a Masters Degree I'll trump all of them, but their like --.
03:40  03:41	FEMALE:  It didn't work?
03:41  03:48	MALE:  No, sadly not, so.  At any rate, so what sort of things do you enjoy doing in your non-historical education reading time.
03:49  04:03	FEMALE:  [laughter] um, well, if I weren't in school then I would spend a bit of time reading, but since I read for school I don't need [laughter].  I don't know I'm like an outdoors [horn] stuff.
04:04  04:07	MALE:  Cool.  Yeah, we're actually going to the Wonderlake Park tomorrow, I guess.  I've never been. I think it will be interesting.  
04:08  04:10	FEMALE:  Cool, well enjoy.  It was nice to meet you.
04:11  04:12	MALE:  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.  I have to see the Redwoods before I leave.
04:13  04:13	FEMALE:  Indeed.
