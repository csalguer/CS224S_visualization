01:13  01:14	MALE:  Really a lot like radio waves and stuff.  
01:15  01:16	FEMALE:  Okay.
01:17  01:22	MALE:  Um, my job was we have this bid old piece of gold platinum and it just floats in space.
01:23  01:24	FEMALE:  It's already floating in space.
01:25  01:38	MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] it just floats away.  But if it charges up like a static pull then therefore it's like [unintelligible].  Well, [unintelligible] we can't [unintelligible].  So my job was without touching take the electrons out and send [unintelligible].  Everybody's happy.

01:56  01:59	MALE:  I like Education folk.
02:00  02:08	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I'm in the Ed School working on my Master's paper which is sort of consuming my life right now.
02:09  02:12	MALE:  That's always a shame.  Do you get a chance to actually enjoy a little [unintelligible].
02:13  02:22	FEMALE:  Yeah, just not like -- there's like a four week window for when that sort of disappears, which you know I guess a four week straight off isn't so terrible.  But --.
02:23  02:24	MALE:  [unintelligible].
02:25  02:30	FEMALE:  I hear that.  Hang out with friends, do stuff outside.
02:31  02:33	MALE:  So, you like hike a little.
02:34  02:42	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I like to go hiking, um, kind of hiking, snow shoeing in the winter.
02:43  02:44	MALE:  Yeah.
02:44  02:47	FEMALE:  Yeah, I tried cross-country skiing.  I fall more than I should, but you know [laughter].
02:48  02:56	MALE:  Anything to do on snow I rather probably be snow shoeing, than just skiing.  Just because it [unintelligible] constantly sliding.
02:57  02:57	FEMALE:  Right.
02:58  02:58	MALE:  Never really --
02:59  03:00	FEMALE:  Yeah, if you can walk you can snow shoe is pretty much how it works.
03:01  03:01	MALE:  [unintelligible]
03:02  03:05	FEMALE:  Although, I will say, if you're on a steep hill and its powdery snow you can slide actually [laughter].
03:06  03:08	MALE:  [unintelligible]
03:09  03:15	FEMALE:  But, yeah.  So what about you, so now that you're in your Zen state and ah --
03:16  03:17	MALE:  Well, I spend most of my time in [unintelligible], but at least I enjoy the work I do.  
03:18  03:20	FEMALE:  That's good.
03:21  03:39	MALE:  When I'm at home, I usually kick back and relax.  Um, maybe see what's on TV or on the radio, see some things on the computer.  Ah, one of these days I want to actually take a vacation.  I think I might actually like to go up north across the bay and see that.  I've been here for about four years and never have gone across the bay.
03:40  03:40	FEMALE:  Really?
03:41  03:44	MALE:  It's kind of a shame. I've been down to Monterrey and [unintelligible] a couple of times.
03:45  03:45	FEMALE:  Okay.
03:46  03:56	MALE:  But I really want to see more of the area.  [unintelligible] he goes up to Yellowstone quite a bit.  He always brings back pictures I think one of these days I'll go up there, who knows.
03:57  04:00	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So what do you plan on doing next?
04:01  04:02	MALE:  [horn] [unintelligible], it really good to meet you.
04:03  04:04	FEMALE:  All right.  Well, nice meeting you [laughter].
