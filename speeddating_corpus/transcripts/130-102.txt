0:01 0:02 MALE:  How's it going?  
0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  How are you?
0:04 0:05 MALE:  Good.  You're in the philosophy program?
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, I am [unintelligible].  
0:09 0:09 MALE:  What's that?
0:09 0:10 FEMALE:  You are in [unintelligible], right?
0:11 0:12 MALE:  I'm in education actually.  I do philosophy of education.  
0:13 0:17 FEMALE:  But you came to the medieval philosophy class.  
0:19 0:20 MALE:  The medieval philosophy class?  
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  You came sometimes with that.  
0:24 0:28 MALE:  Which one was that?  What class--who was teaching it?  
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:33 0:34 MALE: No, I don't think I was there.  
0:33 0:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, you were.  You [unintelligible].
0:35 0:37 MALE:  I don't think I've ever met Allen Whipp [phonetic].  
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  No, not Allen Whipp.  His wife.  
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Oh, Viga [phonetic].
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  Viga [phonetic].
0:42 0:43 MALE:  No, I'm sure I haven't-I'm sure it wasn't me. 
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Oh, come on.
0:45 0:47 MALE:  No, I was in the core ethics seminar with Debra Sapps.
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  Oh, you were in the course?
0:49 0:49 MALE:  Yes.
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:50 0:59 MALE:  That's probably where I know you from, yeah.  The course with the--a year ago in Debra Sapps ethical series [unintelligible].
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, [unintelligible].
1:01 1:02 MALE:  Yes, I was there too. 
1:01 1:04 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]
1:07 1:21 MALE: That's probably where you recognize me from.  So--and I came--are you taking the science, the realism class, structural realism class?  No.  Okay.  Because I went to the first class of that?  What's that?
1:20 1:21 FEMALE: [unintelligible] 
1:23 1:30 MALE:  Maybe Brattman [phonetic]?  I could be mistaken, but I think [unintelligible].  So, what year are you?
1:30 1:30 FEMALE: [unintelligible] 
1:32 1:33 MALE: Second year.  And how do you-
1:32 1:33 FEMALE: [interposing] What year are you?
1:34 1:35 MALE: Also second year. 
1:35 1:39 FEMALE: Are you doing ethics?
1:40 1:42 MALE: I'm doing more the philosophy of social science.  
1:42 1:43 FEMALE: What did you want for ethics?
1:45 2:07 MALE: I hadn't-I hadn't had-I had a little bit of a background in ethics, but I hadn't had as much as I wanted.  And I was thinking about looking at the intersection between sort of moral theory and philosophy of social science.  So, looking at ethical issues and the conduct of education and research.  
2:06 2:08 FEMALE: Did it help in any way?
2:10 2:21 MALE: It was good in terms of giving me sort of an overview and having an excuse to read some things for a second--like some of the Rawl [phonetic] stuff was interesting to read for a second time.  
2:20 2:22 FEMALE: The Rawl stuff you went so quickly-
2:23 2:24 MALE:  [interposing]  We went quickly through it.  
2:23 2:23 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:25 2:36 MALE: But I hadn't read much secondary stuff, and we read a little bit of secondary stuff around that.  So, that was kind of interesting to me.  And I'm interested in-I have broad interests.  That's part of my problem.  I have a lot of different things.  
2:35 2:39 FEMALE: Me too.  I also-I [unintelligible].  
2:42 2:45 MALE: So, do they--are they pretty good about helping you focus early on, or what?
2:44 2:47 FEMALE: Well, we--no, we don't exactly [unintelligible].  
2:48 2:48 MALE: Okay.  
2:48 2:52 FEMALE:  They said it would be out there for this summer to take it.  
2:54 2:54 MALE: Uh-huh.  
2:55 3:00 FEMALE:  So, I guess I'll [unintelligible].  I want to do something in self identity.  
3:02 3:02 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:02 3:07 FEMALE:  So, if that means we [unintelligible], maybe [unintelligible] life.  
3:10 3:10 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:09 3:10 FEMALE:  The end?  
3:11 3:20 MALE:  That's the end.  It feels like it's going faster, doesn't it?  It was nice meeting you, female130.  Take care.
