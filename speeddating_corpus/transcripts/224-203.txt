0:05 0:06 MALE:  Nice to meet you as well. 
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  So this is my spot for the rest of the night.  
0:09 0:09 MALE:  Uh, I get to move around.  
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  [laughter] So I should get comfy. 
0:12 0:12 MALE:  Yeah, I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.  
0:13 0:16 FEMALE:  I think it's good, you get variety.  
0:17 0:19 MALE:  Have you ever done this thing before?  I, this is completely foreign to me.  
0:20 0:22 FEMALE:  [laughter] No I haven't, and I'm a little worried about my microphone positioning.  
0:23 0:25 MALE:  Yeah, I'm self-conscience; I'll probably be stuttering and all sorts of stuff. 
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  So I can check the awkward box-- 
0:28 0:28 MALE:  Yeah, awkward's a safe bet.   
0:29 0:33 FEMALE:  --really quick?  [laughter] Good, good.  Well at least I have boxes already checked. 
0:34 0:34 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:35 0:35 FEMALE:  No, I reserved [unintelligible]. 
0:36 0:36 MALE:  [laughter]
0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  Oh are we already starting? 
0:38 0:39 MALE:  I think they blow the horn.  
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  When we're supposed to start?   
0:41 0:41 MALE:  Yeah.  I think. 
0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  Okay, so this is like an extra long.  
0:44 0:45 MALE:  Exactly, definitely.  So which program are you in?
0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  I'm in the MBA program.  
0:47 0:47 MALE:  Oh really? 
0:48 0:48 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
0:48 0:48 MALE: First year or second year? 
0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  I'm a first year. 
0:49 0:49 MALE:  Okay. 
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  And you? 
0:50 0:53 MALE:  Uh, geophysics, PhD program, fifth year, getting old. 
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  Do you want that TV show Numbers? 
0:56 1:00 MALE:  No, I, I, kind of barely have TV.  No cable or anything.  
1:01 1:01 FEMALE:  Oh that's pretty sad.  
1:02 1:02 ANNOUNCER:  Don't start yet. 
           [horn]
1:02 1:02 MALE:  It is. 
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  Oh we're not supposed to start talking. 
1:04 1:05 ANNOUNCER:  Don't start yet.  
1:06 1:06 FEMALE2:  Too late. 
1:07 1:09 MALE:  Well I don't want to just sit here and not talk [unintelligible]. 
1:10 1:12 FEMALE:  I know, [laughter] that's a little bit more awkward.  
1:13 1:15 MALE:  So what type of business are you going towards, be interested in, like finance or? 
1:16 1:18 FEMALE:  Um, well I came from a finance background. 
1:19 1:19 MALE:  Oh okay. 
1:20 1:22 FEMALE:  But my undergrad was like Japanese studies. 
1:23 1:23 MALE:  Oh really? 
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  So I'm sort of all over the map.  I, but I want to--
           [horn]
1:26 1:28 ANNOUNCER:  Okay, we're starting your first date now. 
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Where did you do your undergrad at? 
1:30 1:31 FEMALE:  I did, I was Dartmouth. 
1:32 1:32 MALE:  Dartmouth, okay, I have some friends who went to Dartmouth. 
1:33 1:34 FEMALE:  And you're wearing green? 
1:35 1:35 MALE:  Uh, yeah.  
1:35 1:36 FEMALE:  Which Irish backs. [laughter] 
1:37 1:38 MALE: My Irish heritage is showing through I guess.  
1:39 1:56 FEMALE:  Ahh.  Yeah.  So that's why I asked about Numbers is because it's this new TV show, it's on Friday nights, I TiVo it.  It's um, it's a really interesting TV show about um, like math and how they use it to solve crimes.  And the last episode was about--they had a physicist on, so--
1:57 1:57 MALE:  Really? 
1:57 1:59 FEMALE:  --when you said a physicist, it made me think of it.  
2:00 2:02 MALE:  Yeah, I don't watch much, I'm addicted to 24.  So--
2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  Ahh.  
2:04 2:05 MALE:  I'm a dork; I download it off the Internet.  
2:06 2:09 FEMALE:  I've heard good things about 24, but it's one of those things where you have to like watch every episode. 
2:10 2:11 MALE:  It's like potato chips, but they aren't that good, but once you get started, you--
2:12 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I know.  I'm like that with certain shows too. 
2:15 2:19 MALE:  It seems clich'e, and cheesy, but it's just, oh, it's good. 
2:20 2:23 FEMALE:  [laughter] So um, so what do you want to do with uh, do you want to be a professor?  
2:24 2:24 MALE:  Um--
2:25 2:25 FEMALE:  I assume. 
2:25 2:30 MALE:  --probably not actually, my field is, well the specific field I'm in is very oil exploration related so--
2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  Oh wow. 
2:32 2:33 MALE:  --yeah, I'm working this summer for Exxon, so nice small company. 
2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  Interesting, where is it going to be located?
2:36 2:37 MALE:  Uh, Houston for the most part.  
2:38 2:41 FEMALE:  Cool.  I have a friend who's working for Texaco, but in Kenya, I think. 
2:42 2:42 MALE:  Oh wow. 
2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah, so--
2:43 2:43 MALE:  One of the nicer locations.
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:44 2:46 MALE:  Generally oil companies are not fun places. 
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  Right. Like off the Argentinian coast or something like that.  
2:50 2:51 MALE:  Offshore stuff or usually stuff in Sudan or all that.  
2:52 2:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Do you do any offshore stuff or--
2:55 3:00 MALE:  Um, most of my research in that sort of thing is Gulf of Mexico related.  So that type of marine geophysics stuff.  
3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  I was born in Houston. 
3:03 3:03 MALE:  Really? 
3:04 3:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, but I don't know very much about it.  But you should watch--have you seen Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room? 
3:09 3:09 MALE:  I've heard it's excellent. I've heard--
3:10 3:11 FEMALE:  I've heard really good things and I'm looking forward to seeing it. 
3:12 3:19 MALE:  Yeah, I was in Houston a few years ago, just as the Enron thing was collapsing.  And I remember I went to a, a baseball game at the, then it was Enron field--
3:20 3:20 FEMALE:  Right. 
3:20 3:21 MALE:  --now it's Minute Maid Park. 
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  Right, right, right.  
3:22 3:36 MALE:  And they had these VP's, these shirts that were Enron Field, and I thought oh that would be all citche [phonetic] and cool to get one of those, and they were on heavy discount.  And I come back to a baseball game a week later, they realized that were citche [phonetic] and cool, so they changed the name to Minute Maid Park and like more then retail.  
3:37 3:37 FEMALE:  Really? 
3:37 3:38 MALE:  Yeah, because of the whole Enron. 
3:39 3:40 FEMALE:  You should have jumped at the chance. 
3:41 3:43 MALE:  Yeah I know.  So if you didn't grow up in Houston, where did you--
3:44 3:46 FEMALE:  I actually lived in Saudi Arabia for five years. 
3:47 3:47 MALE:  Oh wow. 
3:47 3:49 FEMALE:  Uh, my dad is an industrial engineer and worked for--
3:50 3:50 MALE:  Okay, it's got to be oil company related.   
3:51 3:53 FEMALE:  --oil stuff, yeah he works for Aramco, Arabian American Oil Company. 
3:54 3:54 MALE:  Really?  Were you in Reod [phonetic] or? 
3:55 3:56 FEMALE:  No we were actually in Dharkan--
3:57 3:57 MALE:  Oh okay.
3:57 4:01 FEMALE:  --and then we lived in like this little community, sort of Aramco workers--
4:02 4:02 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:02 4:10 FEMALE:  --that was called Abcake [phonetic] which is right outside Dharhan. My brother was born there.  But I really, I consider my hometown Wichita, Kansas since that's were I spent the bulk of growing up. 
4:11 4:11 MALE:  Oh okay.  
4:12 4:13 FEMALE:  So a Midwest gal.  What about you?  
4:14 4:15 MALE:  I'm from Canada, Alberta.  
4:16 4:16 FEMALE:  Oh. 
4:16 4:21 MALE:  So Edmonton, we lived in Edmonton and Calvary, north of Montana.
4:22 4:27 FEMALE:  Do you do--uh, we have a Canadian club at uh, GSB, do you guys, is there any sort of--
4:28 4:28 MALE:  Is it uh--
4:28 4:28 FEMALE:  --PhD Canadian connect? 
4:29 4:32 MALE:  There is, there is, and I guess I'm an officer, but-- 
4:33 4:33 FEMALE:  Wow. 
4:34 4:34 MALE:  The thing is, yeah they just need signatures. 
4:35 4:35 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
4:36 4:45 MALE:  But in some of these things they really need a um, there isn't that much that identifies Canadians being distinct from Americans.  Oh we have a healthcare system, we say about funny,  you know it's really minor, it's colder where we are. 
4:46 4:46 FEMALE:  You say pasta? 
4:47 4:53 MALE:  Yeah pasta, actually I say pasta now, maybe I've been converted.  Well we have weird words, like parkaid and garbarator are two that come up. 
4:54 4:54 FEMALE:  Parkaid? 
4:54 4:57 MALE:  Parkaid's a parking structure, we call it a parkaid.  I find it efficient, parkaid. 
4:58 4:58 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
4:58 4:59 MALE:  You know exactly what it is. 
5:00 5:02 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's better than parking-- I don't know what we call them.

5:05 5:05 FEMALE:  Parking garage, that's right. 
5:05 5:06 MALE:  Car park, there's all these words for it.
