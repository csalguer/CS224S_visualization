0:06 0:09 FEMALE: My goodness.  Yeah.  
MALE: [unintelligible] B-H-A.
0:10 0:10 FEMALE: Sorry about that.
0:10 0:11 MALE: No, no problem.
0:11 0:13 FEMALE: So are we actually supposed to turn these on or--
0:14 0:15 MALE: I think they're supposed to already be on.
0:15 0:17 FEMALE: Okay.  In that case, all right.
0:18 0:19 MALE: Start talking and--
0:19 0:19 FEMALE: S
0:20 0:21 MALE: Oh mine's kind of falling away here.
0:21 0:21 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].
0:24 0:24 MALE: I haven't had a recorder.
0:24 0:26 FEMALE: So how's your week treating you so far?
0:26 0:28 MALE: My week is treating me well.
0:28 0:28 FEMALE: Good.
0:29 0:32 MALE: Though very intense.  I haven't had much time to myself.
0:31 0:31 FEMALE: What do you do?
0:33 0:33 MALE: I'm in the business school.
0:33 0:33 FEMALE: Okay.
0:34 0:35 MALE: And I'm working on business plan--
0:36 0:36 FEMALE: I see.
0:37 0:39 MALE: --that I'm planning to continue with throughout next year.
0:39 0:39 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:40 0:41 MALE: And hopefully the next couple of years--assuming--
0:41 0:42 FEMALE: Right.  Right.
0:42 0:43 MALE: I get money and it works.
0:44 0:44 FEMALE: Very cool.
0:44 0:48 MALE: Um, but it's just, it's like my--this is my last quarter of school, so.
0:48 0:48 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:49 0:50 MALE: I didn't intend to be this busy.
0:51 0:51 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:51 0:52 MALE: And I find myself without much free time.
0:53 0:54 FEMALE: It usually comes to be that way the last quarter--
0:55 0:55 MALE: Yeah.  I guess so.
0:55 0:57 FEMALE: --finishing up stuff.  Yeah.
0:57 0:57 MALE: I guess so.  And you?
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: I'm the school of education, actually.
1:00 1:00 MALE: Oh cool.
1:00 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah.  I'm doing my doctorate in early childhood development.
1:03 1:03 MALE: Oh wow.
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:04 1:05 MALE: I was once an early childhood.
1:06 1:08 FEMALE: Yes [laughter].  I'd imagine you were [laughter].
1:09 1:10 MALE: Um, that sounds very interesting. 
1:11 1:12 FEMALE: Yeah, it is good.  I--
1:12 1:13 MALE: What are you--what specifically are you studying?
1:13 1:25 FEMALE: Um, well I'm actually doing the field work for my dissertation right now.  So um, I study how young children develop at home and at school, and the kinds of knowledge that they develop in those two stages in [unintelligible].
1:25 1:25 MALE: That's pretty cool.
1:25 1:28 FEMALE: And how that travels back and forth, so.
1:30 1:35 MALE: I've been very interested in how things in the lives of young children affect them throughout their lives.
1:36 1:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  I think that there's a lot of interesting stuff.
1:39 1:39 MALE: Yeah.
1:39 1:41 FEMALE: --in kind of, you know, this area that I'm looking at--
1:42 1:42 MALE: That's really cool.
1:42 1:45 FEMALE: --that, you know, has to do with this lifespan development kind of stuff, so.
1:47 1:50 MALE: Is your finding that those are the most formidable years in their lives?
1:51 1:53 FEMALE: I mean, I think they'll find people that--
1:53 1:54 MALE: In terms of forming values and--
1:54 2:05 FEMALE: I get a sense, yes.  I mean, I don't mean to say that to say, you know, it's rigid and, you know, that's the way it's going to be, like it's so determined it's [unintelligible] or whatever.  I think to a large extent, your early experiences--
2:05 2:05 MALE: I think so.
2:05 2:08 FEMALE: --kind of inform kind of the person you are going to be later on.  But--
2:08 2:10 MALE: That's right.  What ages are considered early childhood? 
2:10 2:11 FEMALE: I went with preschoolers, actually. 
2:12 2:12 MALE: Oh so really young.
2:13 2:17 FEMALE: So early childhood is probably more like toddlerhood onwards or something, but, yeah.
2:17 2:18 MALE: Wow.  And how long have you been at this?
2:19 2:22 FEMALE: Oh my lord, this is like my fourth year here.  I'm embarrassed to say.
2:23 2:24 MALE: It's not a bad place to spend four years.
2:23 2:32 FEMALE: [unintelligible] graduate school for some time now.  So, yeah.  So what is your business plan about that you're racking up here?
2:33 2:41 MALE: We are--you may know something about it.  We are--uh, it's basically a health and wellness services business.
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: Okay.
2:42 2:49 MALE: Trying to affect behavioral change in employees of companies, areas like nutrition and fitness.
2:49 2:50 FEMALE: Right.
2:50 2:54 MALE: And, um, weight management, stress management, ergonomics.
2:53 2:53 FEMALE: I see.
2:55 3:00 MALE: So try to something comprehensive that will help, kind of the whole preventative help as opposed to--
3:00 3:00 FEMALE: Right.
3:00 3:01 MALE: --[unintelligible] treatment--
3:01 3:02 FEMALE: Oh interesting.
3:02 3:03 MALE: And there's a lot of studies now--
3:04 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:03 3:06 MALE: --proving that there's a real return on investment because--
3:06 3:06 FEMALE: Okay.
3:07 3:08 MALE: --you save a lot of money in health care costs.
3:09 3:11 FEMALE: Were you in the health care industry before--
3:11 3:11 MALE: Not at all.
3:11 3:13 FEMALE: --you started here?  Or you just kind of fell into it?
3:14 3:16 MALE: I--this all happened in the last month or so.
3:17 3:17 FEMALE: Really?
3:19 3:21 MALE: I'm fairly athletic.  I worked at Nike last summer.
3:22 3:22 FEMALE: Okay.
3:22 3:25 MALE: So I'm very interested in health and fitness in general.
3:25 3:25 FEMALE: Sure, sure.
3:26 3:34 MALE: And um, I had planned to go back to Nike, but don't really want to move to Portland.  And have had entrepreneurial hopes for a long time.
3:35 3:35 FEMALE: Yeah?
3:36 3:44 MALE: And I came upon, um, this good friend, classmate of mine.  Um, his--he has sort of a team of people working on this business.
3:44 3:44 FEMALE: Okay.
3:45 3:48 MALE: So I joined that team.  And now, it looks like I'm going to continue to work with them after school.
3:47 3:47 FEMALE: Oh cool.
3:49 3:49 MALE: So--
3:50 3:52 FEMALE: Did you want to stay in the area then?  Is that your hope?
3:53 3:54 MALE: Yes.  I love the area.
3:54 3:56 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's a good place to be.  Did you grow up here? Or--
3:57 3:57 MALE: I grew up in New York.
3:58 4:00 FEMALE: Me too.  That's so funny.
3:59 3:59 MALE: Where in New York?
4:00 4:01 FEMALE: In Long Island, actually.
4:01 4:01 MALE: I did as well.
4:01 4:01 FEMALE: Really? 
4:03 4:03 MALE: Where in Long Island?
4:04 4:05 FEMALE: [unintelligible] I'm from [unintelligible].
4:05 4:07 MALE: Okay.  I went to Harricks [phonetic] in Albertson.
4:08 4:08 FEMALE: Oh okay.  [unintelligible].
4:08 4:11 MALE: That's funny.  Good talking to you.  Nice meeting you.
4:11 4:11 FEMALE: Yeah.  It was so nice to meet you too.
4:12 4:12 MALE: Take care.
4:13 4:13 FEMALE: [laughter] You too.
4:13 4:14 MALE: Now, I'm going somewhere?
