2:33 2:33 FEMALE: Really? I think he's a pig.
2:30 2:30 MALE: You think he's a pig? Okay.

2:46 2:49 FEMALE: And then when I left he told me it was too bad that I was leaving because I always dressed so nice.
2:46 2:46 MALE: Oh shit.
2:51 2:52 FEMALE: Yeah. He was a pig.
2:51 2:53 MALE: I wouldn't have thought of that. I would have.
