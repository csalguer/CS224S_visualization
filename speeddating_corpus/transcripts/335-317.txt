0:05 0:10 MALE: female335.  Okay.  So, uh, my name is male317, and it's short for male317 [phonetic].
0:11 0:12 FEMALE: Oh, it's nice to meet you.
0:11 0:12 MALE: You too.  So you grew up in the US?
0:14 0:15 FEMALE: Yes.  Yeah, I was born here?
0:14 0:15 MALE: Indian?
0:16 0:17 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:16 0:18 MALE: Okay. Same here. Where'd you grow up?  
0:20 0:25 FEMALE: Um, I was born in North Carolina, but I grew up in Sacramento.  So just right around here.
0:24 0:26 MALE: Neighborhood girl.
0:27 0:28 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:27 0:32 MALE: So I'm a, uh--a--I grew up in Pennsylvania area. 
0:34 0:34 FEMALE: Oh, yeah?
0:32 0:37 MALE: I'm not a long-term--but I guess by now I am a long-term resident out here.  I've been out here for about a decade.
0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Oh, wow.  That is a long time. 
0:39 0:40 MALE: I know.  It seems like it. 
0:42 0:43 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah. 
0:42 0:43 MALE: So, uh--
0:44 0:45 FEMALE: Whereabouts in Pennsylvania?
0:44 0:45 MALE: Uh, north of Pittsburgh.
0:47 0:47 FEMALE: Okay. 
0:47 0:49 MALE: Yeah, north of Pittsburgh, a little town called Newcastle.
0:51 0:51 FEMALE: Oh.
0:50 0:52 MALE: Yeah, I don't know if you're familiar with Pennsylvania.
0:53 0:57 FEMALE: No, but my sister went to grad school in Philadelphia, so, I liked--I like Pennsylvania.
0:54 0:57 MALE: Oh, okay.  My brother's out there.  Yeah?  You've been there several times?
0:59 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah. I spent some time in Lancaster, too, briefly.
1:01 1:04 MALE: Okay.  Cool.  Okay.  
1:05 1:06 FEMALE: For a summer.  Yeah. 
1:04 1:06 MALE: So what are you studying here?
1:07 1:13 FEMALE: Um, well, I went here for college, and I was an applied math major, and now I am getting my PhD in biology. 
1:12 1:17 MALE: Biology.  Okay.  So there's a couple people--other, uh, women here from Biology.
1:19 1:21 FEMALE: Yeah, actually, nameX is, uh, from my program. 
1:20 1:20 MALE: Okay. 
1:22 1:23 FEMALE: So, I study evolution.
1:22 1:25 MALE: Okay.  So you're one of those people that the, uh, Bible thumpers keep cursing.
1:28 1:31 FEMALE: Yes.  It's not just a theory.  I don't know who told you.  But it's not just a theory.
1:30 1:33 MALE: [laughter] You don't want that being taught anymore.  You know--
1:35 1:41 FEMALE: It's awful.  It's not like evolution even gets taught to begin with, though.  I mean, when I think about what I learned in high school, it's--
1:36 1:40 MALE: That's right.  Next to nothing.
1:42 1:43 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:41 1:42 MALE: So what do you think of Stephen J. Gould?
1:46 1:46 FEMALE: Stephen Gould--
1:44 1:45 MALE: Is he a god or is he an idiot?
1:48 1:58 FEMALE: Oh, I think he's a very smart person.  I think that--I envy the way that he was able to explain science.  I would like to be able to write like that, but I actually love his sports writing.  His baseball essays.
1:55 1:56 MALE: Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's really into baseball.
1:59 1:59 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:57 2:02 MALE: He'd take an entire lecture off class just to explain to us about baseball averages and how they, they are improving over time.
2:02 2:13 FEMALE: Yeah.  They published a book of his baseball essays posthumously, which I love, and I have.  Um, but when I was interviewing at grad school, it was right before he passed away.  And so I met him. 
2:10 2:13 MALE: Oh, he--I didn't know that.  He passed away, huh?  Oh, wow.  Okay. 
2:14 2:33 FEMALE: Yes, yeah.  In 2002.  And, um, I met him right before that, um, when I was there, which was really nice.  So, yeah, I think he's great.  And he did a lot for biology.  He's kind of like the Richard Fineman of Biology that way.  But, you know, it's good to be controversial.  Um, I think his older books are better than his later books. 
2:32 2:35 MALE: That's right.  And so what do you like to do in your spare time?
2:38 2:40 FEMALE: Gosh, what do you mean spare time?  I work [unintelligible].
2:40 2:41 MALE: I love that response.  You get that [unintelligible]. 
2:43 2:59 FEMALE: [laughter].  I know.  Well, see, I don't have structured hobbies.  I mean, mostly what I do for fun is just spend time with my friends and drive around the area.  I really love the Bay area and Santa Cruise.  Um, I run, even though I actually really don't like it, but I do it anyway. 
2:57 2:58 MALE: Really?  Okay. 
3:00 3:08 FEMALE: There are lots of pretty areas to do it around here.  At least you can, you know, run in forests and things.  And, um, I don't know.  I like to watch movies, go out to eat. 
3:07 3:08 MALE: Sounds pretty much like what I do.
3:11 3:15 FEMALE: Yeah, I mean, basically, I really like talking, so I like to do things that allow me to talk, so--
3:13 3:14 MALE: Lot of conversation, huh?
3:17 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah. Except you can't talk in the movie theater too often.  Usually you have to do something before or after that you can talk during. 
3:20 3:21 MALE: Exactly.  Exactly.
3:23 3:24 FEMALE: Unless you go to a drive-in.  
3:24 3:26 MALE: But then it's not always talking people are doing in the drive-in.
3:29 3:34 FEMALE: That's true.  Yeah.  It's hard to find a drive-in around here, too.  I grew up, I mean, in Sacramento, there's one right near my house.
3:32 3:32 MALE: Uh huh.
3:35 3:41 FEMALE: And so we used to go all the time.  Like in high school one night, you know, it's, like, two bucks a car and you all pile into the car and go.
3:38 3:40 MALE: Oh, man.  That sounds like fun.
3:42 3:48 FEMALE: Yeah, but here, it's really hard to find drive-ins, and I have so many friends who've never been.  [unintelligible].  But--
3:46 3:54 MALE: Yeah, we used to do this, too.  We used to all pile in and go to school in a, uh, friend's car.  So we'd stuff more people than were legal, and we'd all have to duck down.
3:55 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:54 3:57 MALE: Whenever a policeman came by, we'd always ducked down so they'd only see three heads.
3:57 3:59 FEMALE: [laughter] 
3:59 4:06 MALE: One time, somebody yelled, "Duck," and he ducked too, and he's driving.  It's so stupid.  Nobody's driving this van.
4:08 4:10 FEMALE: Oh, no. [laughter] 
4:08 4:09 MALE: It was nice meeting you.
4:10 4:13 FEMALE: It's really nice to meet you.  [laughter]
