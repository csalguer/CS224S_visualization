1:24 1:27 MALE: Okay, uh-huh.  Do you like it here?  
1:19 1:23 FEMALE: Yeah.  Now I do.  At the beginning, I--
1:31 1:32 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, kind of a--
1:24 1:26 FEMALE: [interposing]  You are from here?  
1:34 1:38 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I was born in Minnesota.  Do you know where that is?  
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Uh.  
1:40 1:41 MALE: I should have made you guess.  
1:33 1:37 FEMALE:  Actually, no.  [unintelligible] Romania.  
1:45 1:45 MALE:  Okay.  
1:39 1:40 FEMALE:  You are Indian, right?  
1:48 1:50 MALE: Yeah, my parents are both from India.  
1:43 1:43 FEMALE: Where?  
1:52 1:57 MALE:  Different ends of India.  My dad was from the Calcutta area.  My mom was from near Bombay.  
1:51 1:52 FEMALE: How do they feel about this country?  
2:01 2:09 MALE: They like it better.  Like there's a lot of like I guess [unintelligible] values in India that they didn't like.  
1:59 2:00 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
2:09 2:21 MALE:  No, actually I don't.  See, they knew--from like [unintelligible] they knew different languages, but I didn't speak anything at home really.  So, I didn't--they spoke English at home.  
2:13 2:25 FEMALE:  So, if you [unintelligible] Indian, but I went to [unintelligible].  I did some research in Kierkegaard and I like to not [unintelligible]how it's so clean and--
2:33 2:34 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, uh-huh. 
2:27 2:28 FEMALE: But then [unintelligible].  
2:36 2:46 MALE:  Yeah, that's true.  So, I mean at first--I mean it was all on you growing up there so it didn't really bother me.  I was pretty much used to it, but I think when I--
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  [interposing]  In a suburb?  
2:47 2:47 MALE:  What's that?  
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]?  
2:48 2:51 MALE:  Yeah, a suburb of Minneapolis.  Were you in Minneapolis?  
2:43 2:49 FEMALE:  I went to near Minneapolis, San [unintelligible] college.  Do you know that?  
2:57 2:58 MALE:  Oh, Saint Ellis.  Uh-huh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  
2:51 2:55 FEMALE:  I didn't like it.  It was very like there was lots of money coming from Denmark and Norway.  
3:03 3:04 MALE: Oh really?  
2:56 3:06 FEMALE: To fund different research.  Everybody had Danish clogs at the foreign hall legion.  Their porch, and I felt like I'm in another country.  
3:14 3:20 MALE:  You're back in Europe at least.  Uh-huh.  
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  I like the [unintelligible] here.  
3:21 3:32 MALE: Yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah, maybe it's probably a little better.  But it's still not the same as here.  There's only like maybe a few different kinds of wood.  
3:24 3:28 FEMALE: You're allergic to [unintelligible].  
3:36 3:36 MALE:  What's that?  
3:28 3:33 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I'm allergic [unintelligible]?  
3:41 3:44 MALE:  Yeah, I do, but I like it here better I think definitely.  
3:36 3:37 FEMALE: Because it's more diverse and [unintelligible].  
3:45 3:49 MALE: Yeah, and I think people are a lot more liberal here in general. 
3:41 3:47 FEMALE:  So, [unintelligible] do you parallel Indian liberal values to--
3:56 4:00 MALE:  [interposing]  My parents are really not--we're really not with the Indian values too much.  
3:53 3:56 FEMALE:  I feel like--but I miss my [unintelligible].  
4:04 4:09 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, it was nice to meet you.
