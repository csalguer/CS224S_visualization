0:00:16.6 0:00:18.7 MALE:  Uh, a year- a year away. 
0:00:11.6 0:00:12.7 FEMALE:  What are you going to do after that?
0:00:20.2 0:00:24.2 MALE:  Get a job at a small company doing research.  Now you're gonna ask [unintelligible] it's like- 
0:00:16.2 0:00:18.1 FEMALE:  [laughter] There you go.
0:00:24.5 0:00:26.9 MALE:  Okay, now, you, uh, so what are you studying?
0:00:19.6 0:00:22.3 FEMALE:  Uh, I'm a first-year PhD student in Russian literature.
0:00:29.6 0:00:31.3 MALE:  Okay, I'm glad I didn't try to guess that.
0:00:24.1 0:00:25.2 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:00:31.8 0:00:35.0 MALE:  Okay, so, uh, have you spent any time in Russia?
0:00:27.9 0:00:33.4 FEMALE:  Yeah I, um, traveled there every year from like ninety-two to ninety-nine and then-
0:00:40.0 0:00:40.6 MALE:  Wow.
0:00:33.1 0:00:35.4 FEMALE:  -uh, haven't been since then.
0:00:40.9 0:00:43.7 MALE:  Ninety-two to ninety-nine, why would you do that?
0:00:36.6 0:00:41.2 FEMALE:  Uh, the first time it was a high school exchange.  I was a sophomore in high school, and there was just a - 
0:00:47.7 0:00:48.7 MALE:  Moscow, or something?
0:00:41.4 0:00:44.4 FEMALE:  Uh, no, it was actually a little town in the Far East, called Havaros.
0:00:51.6 0:00:52.2 MALE:  Called what?
0:00:45.1 0:00:45.9 FEMALE:  Havaros.
0:00:53.1 0:00:54.3 MALE:  The Far East, that's like-
0:00:47.0 0:00:47.6 FEMALE:  Near China.
0:00:55.2 0:00:55.9 MALE:  Okay.
0:00:48.7 0:00:55.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, it- that's our sister city.  I'm from Portland, Oregon.  So that was our sister city.  So I went there and then I just kept going back.
0:01:03.1 0:01:08.0 MALE:  And then what, you just started reading books while you were there and like, hey, I might just study literature?
0:01:00.3 0:01:03.6 FEMALE:  No I started in co- in high school actually, a high school operative, so-
0:01:09.2 0:01:10.8 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
0:01:03.4 0:01:12.1 FEMALE:  -I started it, and that's how the-- that was the whole point, kind of, and uh, so yeah, so then I kept going back, spent four months in Moscow on a program, and-
0:01:19.9 0:01:24.0 MALE:  Cool.  Is this a pretty small department of, um, Russian Literature?
0:01:16.5 0:01:19.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, they only admit like one or two people a year.
0:01:26.5 0:01:27.0 MALE:  Wow.  
0:01:19.4 0:01:23.9 FEMALE:  So, so it's maybe twelve, fifteen people max, you know?
0:01:30.4 0:01:33.2 MALE:  Wow, and then they- do they- is it- do they fail people, too?
0:01:26.6 0:01:29.5 FEMALE:  I don't know.  Not very many. [laughter] 
0:01:34.6 0:01:37.2 MALE:  I guess not.  I guess not.  [laughter]  
0:01:29.7 0:01:30.6 FEMALE:  Definitely-
0:01:37.1 0:01:38.7 MALE:   You would probably know.  [laughter].  
0:01:30.8 0:01:32.5 FEMALE:   Yeah.  It's like-
0:01:39.2 0:01:43.5 MALE:  Like, uh, electrical engineers, I guess they get failed half of the time or something.
0:01:36.4 0:01:40.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, I- I have some friends in the Aero/Astro department, too, that are kind of like-
0:01:47.2 0:01:47.8 MALE:  It's tough.
0:01:40.6 0:01:41.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:48.6 0:01:52.0 MALE:  Although it's really valuable to get a Master's, in those- whatever.
0:01:44.9 0:01:45.4 FEMALE:  Right.
0:01:51.8 0:01:55.2 MALE:  So it's like, oh, you failed, but you still get a nice degree.  
0:01:46.8 0:01:50.7 FEMALE:  Bummer.  Yeah.  So what started your interest in geophysics?
0:01:58.0 0:02:01.0 MALE:  Um, oh, that's a good question.  That's a new one for tonight. 
0:01:53.6 0:01:54.8 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:02:00.7 0:02:24.7 MALE:  Uh, what's- uh, yeah, how did it start?  Well, yeah I got into geology, uh, probably for the wrong reasons.  You know, I wanted to avoid computers and be outside and all that.  And then I discovered that I didn't really like it that much.  I liked physics much more.  But I did like certain aspects of geology, the fact that it's very chaotic and- and it's- this- this is what I didn't like about in the pure sense is that it's-
0:02:17.5 0:02:17.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:24.8 0:02:29.3 MALE:  -so chaotic and there are no real rules.  I mean, it's- it's very qua- qualitative, right?
0:02:22.0 0:02:22.5 FEMALE:  Right.
0:02:29.4 0:02:38.6 MALE:  But then when you bring in the- the physics of measurement, and suddenly there's this quantitative aspect, it makes it very interesting, because you're trying to measure something that's- that anything can happen with.
0:02:31.4 0:02:31.9 FEMALE:  Right.
0:02:38.5 0:02:41.0 MALE:  So- so it's a good mix.  So that's-
0:02:33.7 0:02:34.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:41.1 0:02:42.5 MALE:  -that's the answer to that question.
0:02:34.2 0:02:35.6 FEMALE:  That sounds very interesting.
0:02:42.8 0:02:44.0 MALE:  Oh, it's cool.  It's- it's-
0:02:36.3 0:02:38.5 FEMALE:  Good answer.  [laughter].
0:02:44.6 0:02:46.7 MALE:  Yeah, I like it.  Well, thanks.  Yeah.
0:02:39.7 0:02:40.6 FEMALE:  How do you like California?
0:02:47.9 0:02:51.9 MALE:  Uh, it's cool, it's- I like it a lot.  I have family near- yeah, you know, I guess-
0:02:45.3 0:02:46.3 FEMALE:  Where are you from originally?
0:02:53.2 0:02:53.8 MALE:  Connecticut.
0:02:46.4 0:02:47.1 FEMALE:  Mm-hmm.
0:02:54.4 0:02:56.2 MALE:  You- you said you were from some-
0:02:48.5 0:02:49.3 FEMALE:  Portland, Oregon.
0:02:56.4 0:02:57.4 MALE:  Oh, yeah, okay.
0:02:49.9 0:02:50.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:58.0 0:02:58.7 MALE:  Cool.
0:02:51.5 0:02:52.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:58.8 0:03:01.7 MALE:  Okay, so, uh, do you go up there often, or-
0:02:54.9 0:03:05.3 FEMALE:  Um, yeah, I've, uh, gone home for regular breaks, and then at least once a quarter just for random things, a Halloween party and stuff like that.
0:03:11.4 0:03:14.0 MALE:  Both your parents are together, still married?
0:03:06.2 0:03:09.2 FEMALE:  No, they're- my parents are divorced, but they both live up there, so-
0:03:15.8 0:03:16.5 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:03:09.3 0:03:18.6 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's nice.  It's really nice to be close to home.  I went to school out East, and uh, that was just a bitch of a travel issue, getting back and forth to school.
0:03:24.6 0:03:25.9 MALE:  Yeah.  Where did you go?
0:03:18.8 0:03:19.6 FEMALE:  Uh, Dartmouth.
0:03:26.9 0:03:27.6 MALE:  Nice.
0:03:20.5 0:03:21.1 FEMALE:  So-
0:03:28.2 0:03:29.5 MALE:  New Hampshire, nice.
0:03:21.9 0:03:26.9 FEMALE:  Yeah. Yeah, it was beautiful, but I definitely-- I'm a West Coasty kind of girl.
0:03:33.1 0:03:35.6 MALE:   Uh-huh.  You studied Russian lit then, too.
0:03:27.5 0:03:28.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
0:03:36.4 0:03:37.0 MALE:  Wow.
0:03:29.3 0:03:31.0 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, so-
0:03:37.7 0:03:42.4 MALE:  So why-- why- what is special about Russian literature?  I mean, what makes-- sets it apart?
0:03:35.4 0:03:50.2 FEMALE:  Um, I think the- the his- the history of the country is so, um, complicated and, uh, people there went through so much suffering, you know, it's just thousands of years of oppression, serfdom, Communism, wars-
0:03:56.4 0:03:58.6 MALE:  Religions going back and forth over-- yeah.
0:03:50.6 0:03:54.8 FEMALE:  You know, and- and yet it's produced some of the best literature and art in the world.
0:04:02.0 0:04:02.4 MALE:  Wow.
0:03:55.2 0:04:00.3 FEMALE:  And um, it's just a really interesting country.  I mean, there's so many good things about it-
0:04:06.2 0:04:07.0 [horn]
0:04:00.1 0:04:02.9 FEMALE:  -and so many fucked-up things about it.  And so-
0:04:09.5 0:04:10.5 MALE:  That's a very good answer.
0:04:03.4 0:04:04.9 FEMALE:  Thank you.  [laughter].
0:04:10.5 0:04:12.4 MALE:  [laughter].  Yeah.
0:04:05.1 0:04:06.1 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you. 
0:04:12.1 0:04:13.7 MALE:  Okay, well nice to meet you, female221.
0:04:06.6 0:04:07.2 FEMALE:  Bye.
0:04:14.4 0:04:15.0 MALE:  Take care.
