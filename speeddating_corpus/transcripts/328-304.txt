0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:00 0:00 MALE:  Hey, how do you do?
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  I'm good.  I'm female328.
0:01 0:01 MALE:  male304.
0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male304.
0:02 0:09 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  Um so um well, like what department are you in?  Uh how long have you been here?
0:11 0:14 FEMALE:  I'm--I'm at the business school.  Um I'm a second-year MBA.
0:12 0:12 MALE:  Okay.
0:15 0:22 FEMALE:  Um which means I don't do any defiler [phonetic] research, but I'm working at a startup that does robotics.  So um--
0:20 0:20 MALE:  [interposing] Wow.
0:23 0:25 FEMALE:  --my head is way too much in the robotics space right now.
0:23 0:23 MALE:  Okay.
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  So I'll--I'll try not to talk about robotics.
0:26 0:26 MALE:  No, no.  I kind of like robotics, so.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  What's your area?
0:28 0:29 MALE:  I'm in--I'm in EE.
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  Oh.
0:30 0:38 MALE:  So I'm--I'm a grad student.  I just uh--I've been working for a couple years, and I just came back for--for graduate school.  This is my first year here, so.
0:40 0:42 FEMALE:  Cool.  What's your area within EE?
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Um optimization.
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:42 0:44 MALE:  It's like finance, that kind of thing, like--
0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh interesting.
0:45 0:46 MALE:  --like optimizing equations.
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:47 0:49 MALE:  It's just like a math kind of thing, so.
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  But wait, for EE?
0:51 0:51 MALE:  Yeah.
0:54 0:56 FEMALE:  But you're doing finance optimizations?
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Well, no.  I'm just doing optimizations in general.
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
0:57 0:59 MALE:  But I mean like that would be like an obvious application of it, so.
1:01 1:01 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
1:00 1:01 MALE:  I just thought I'd throw something out, so.
1:04 1:08 FEMALE:  Cool.  So you're figuring--you're figuring out what your PhD topic's going to be then?
1:06 1:08 MALE:  Yeah, pretty much.  I'm thinking about it.
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  How do you like the program so far?
1:09 1:13 MALE:  It's good.  Um it's a lot better than my undergrad.
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:14 1:15 MALE:  So I'm, you know, I'm really excited about being here.
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  Cool.
1:16 1:19 MALE:  Yeah, so I hope to, you know, stay here for as long as I can, so.
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:20 1:21 MALE:  We'll see how it goes.
1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:21 1:25 MALE:  What about business school?  Man, I--congratulations on getting in.  I know a lot of people who tried.
1:27 1:30 FEMALE:  I know a lot of people who tried to get into the EE program, so.
1:28 1:28 MALE:  Okay.
1:30 1:32 FEMALE:  So kudos to you, too.  
1:30 1:30 MALE:  Yes, okay.  [laughter].
1:33 1:42 FEMALE:  Um I--I'm enjoying it.  It's a lot more work than--than I was told.  I was told that I would have learned to play golf by now.  I still haven't.  I've been out on the green once, but that--
1:41 1:42 MALE:  [interposing] Okay.  In two years, you've been out once?
1:45 2:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, and it was--it was sad.  I was only down there because I needed to buy presents.  We were--we were going on this um--on this business school trip to Singapore and Thailand, and so we needed to bring presents to each of our speakers.  And we decided that, you know, golf memorabilia would be good for those speakers who we knew played golf.  And so I went down there, and I bought the stuff, and the guy who was selling it to me is like have you ever used one of these.  Like uh-huh.  Okay, come on.  And so we like--we hit a ball around this little putting green for a little bit.  So that's the extent of my golf course experience.
2:15 2:17 MALE:  Do you--do you want to play golf or--
2:20 2:32 FEMALE:  [interposing] I--I want to have more leisure time, but--and I'm not sure that I prioritize golf within that, but golf is up there somewhere.
2:30 2:30 MALE:  Oh.
2:32 2:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Do you play golf?
2:32 2:39 MALE:  No, but I mean, it seems like you probably have, you know, a lot--a lot of time to do a lot of social activities in business school.  So I figured--
2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  [interposing] It's kind of a myth.
2:40 2:43 MALE:  Really?  So what do you--what do you do in business school besides [unintelligible]?
2:45 3:09 FEMALE:  Um well, so the first year there are a ton of classes.  There's a lot of--a lot of very college--like problem sets and exams and, you know, there's mid terms and there's finals, and it's--it's very college--like for the first like two quarters.  Right now, um like I said, I'm very much involved in a startup.  And ostensibly, it's for three credits worth of class, but realistically, it's a 40-hour-a-week job, so.
3:07 3:09 MALE:  Forty hours a week, wow.
3:11 3:26 FEMALE:  I've just spent two days in Boston at this robotics conference, and right before this, I was at--actually at a thing trying to recruit electrical engineers.  [laughter].  So it's getting--it's not so much free time really.
3:25 3:25 MALE:  Oh really, okay.
3:27 3:28 FEMALE:  But--but some--
3:26 3:26 MALE:  [interposing] It's unfortunate.  
3:29 3:34 FEMALE:  --enough for stuff like this, and enough that tomorrow I'm going to go to the 80s dance party at the GSC [phonetic]--
3:33 3:33 MALE:  [interposing] Oh nice, okay.
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  --'cause I think that will be fun.
3:34 3:36 MALE:  Okay.  I'm probably going to be there, too, so.
3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  Awesome.  
3:37 3:37 MALE:  Yeah.
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  I'll look forward to seeing--I hope to see you there.  
3:39 3:39 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:41 3:42 FEMALE:  Um--
3:40 3:43 MALE:  [interposing] Are--are you a--of--of--of mixed um heritage?
3:46 3:50 FEMALE:  My mom's from the Philippines, kind of Filipino-Chinese.  And yourself, where are you from?
3:49 3:50 MALE:  I'm from Hong Kong.
3:52 3:54 FEMALE:  Oh, excellent.  My dad lived in Macau [phonetic] for many years.
3:52 3:53 MALE:  Okay.
3:55 3:56 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male304.
3:54 3:55 MALE:  Nice to meet you uh female328.
