@0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  Can you give me two more seconds?
@0:03 0:04 MALE:  Go for it.  No worries.
0:44 0:46 FEMALE:  So I'm identification number 23?  Is that what I am?
0:00 0:03 MALE:  Uh, this is station--I don't know.  I put station C.
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  Station C?
0:04 0:06 MALE:  Yeah.  But I think that's what my chair says.
0:53 0:55 FEMALE:  Okay, right.  So what's this number?
0:08 0:10 MALE:  That--I don't--I think that's just your number--  
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Oh okay.
0:12 0:14 MALE:  --to identify you.  This is crazy [laughter].
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  It's beyond crazy.
0:17 0:17 MALE:  [laughter] I'm male102.
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  female123.  
0:19 0:19 MALE:  Nice to meet you, female123.
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  It's nice to meet you.
0:21 0:21 MALE:  What, uh, program are you in?
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  Um, guess.
0:24 0:26 MALE:  Uh, business?
1:13 1:13 FEMALE:  Really?
0:28 0:33 MALE:  I--you look like a sort of conservatively dressed in a sophisticated...
1:21 1:26 FEMALE:  Oh nice with the compliments.  Okay that gets rid of my initial, like, why [unintelligible] in the business school?  I'm in the law school.
0:40 0:43 MALE:  Oh you're in law school?  Oh, that's not--law school and business school are not too far off.
1:27 1:34 FEMALE:  So now [unintelligible]--that's not too far off.  Yeah, but my roots are actually elsewhere.  I'm just in law school 'cause I'm a failed graduate student.
0:49 0:55 MALE:  [laughter] That's a [unintelligible].  [laughter] Being in Stanford Law School is not too big a failure, but...
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  [laughter] Uh, what program are you in?
0:56 1:00 MALE:  I, I'm in the ED school.  I do Quality of Education [unintelligible] program.
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Oh what's quality of education like?
1:02 1:17 MALE:  It's great.  It's a really small sort of unique program.  So there's two philosophy, then faculty.  And I take about half my courses in philosophy, and some in political theory, and some in the ED school.  So it's kind of you piece together your program.  It's very independent.
2:05 2:06 FEMALE:  I'm a failed philosophy grad student/
1:20 1:20 MALE:  Really?
2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  At UCLA.
1:22 1:25 MALE:  That's a great program.  Uh, you didn't like it there?
2:12 2:15 FEMALE:  No, I loved it there.  I--do you know who Shawna Sheferin [phonetic] is?
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Shawna?
2:16 2:19 FEMALE:  Sheferin?  She does political--she's a legal philosopher?
1:32 1:32 MALE: No, I don't.
2:20 2:24 FEMALE:  So I went down there 'cause I wanted to be her.  She's one of the up and coming rising stars.
1:38 1:38 MALE:  Uh-huh.
2:25 2:41 FEMALE:  She does legal--she has her PHD in philosophy, JD Law.  She's [unintelligible] at the intersection.  She's amazing.  I wanted to be her.  I went down there, and we don't get [laughter] along.  And it's also, she's so intimidatingly smart, and I know that I could never be that smart.  I'm like, you know how frustrating philosophy is.
1:55 1:56 MALE:  Oh my gosh, yes.
2:43 2:50 FEMALE:  I mean, you know, you're just sitting there, and you read the same stupid four or five lines.  You're like what the f is going on?  You know, and--
2:03 2:20 MALE:  It requires serious commitment.  And it's very easy to feel very dumb, um, as you go through the readings and go to different classes.  And everyone sort of has their niche focus, you know.  And I took a court ethics seminar a year ago, and it was all the philosophy [unintelligible]--
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  Who had it?
2:20 2:21 MALE:  Uh, Debra [unintelligible]--
3:09 3:09 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:21 2:32 MALE:  --who's terrific.  I like her a lot.  She does stuff that's--I do basically philosophy social science.  Like I'm very interested in philosophy of education research, and thinking about how we study education.  So that's my focus.
3:20 3:22 FEMALE:  That's really, really interesting.  I had never heard of philosophy of education before.
2:35 2:55 MALE:  Yeah.  It's sort of a, uh, it's sort of a philosophical look at or studying of educational issues.  So it's very interesting.  But it's a really bipolar sort of place to be, or schizophrenic, because you're--if you're in a philosophy department, it's very clear that you're writing for philosophy people. 
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Right.
2:55 3:12 MALE:  But if you're in a ED school, you're writing, in a way, more for the educational researchers that are there than the other philosophy people.  So that affects kind of how you end up--what you end up writing, how you end up framing it.  If you're writing for people who don't have a lot of background often times, in philosophy.
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:14 3:15 MALE:  That was quick.  
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Yeah it was.  
3:15 3:16 MALE:  It was nice meeting you, female123.
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you, too.
3:17 3:18 MALE:  Take care.
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Thanks, you too.
