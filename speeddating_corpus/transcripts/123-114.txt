0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:03 0:03 MALE:  Hi.
0:05 0:05 FEMALE:  female123.
0:04 0:04 MALE:  I'm male114.
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  So what [unintelligible] are you?
0:09 0:09 FEMALE:  What's that?
0:09 0:09 MALE:  What departments are you in?
0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.
0:11 0:11 MALE:  Oh law school.
0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  How about you?
0:13 0:13 MALE:  Sociology.
0:15 0:17 FEMALE:  Oh, that's a doctoral program?
0:16 0:16 MALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] PhD.
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  How's that going?
0:17 0:17 MALE:  Busy.
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  First year?
0:18 0:18 MALE:  Yeah.
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  What do you study?
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Uh, [unintelligible] sociology.
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  Sorry?
0:22 0:23 MALE:  Economic sociology.
0:24 0:28 FEMALE:  What the hell is that [laughter]?  I have never heard of that before.
0:27 0:39 MALE:  Well it's basically looking up the economy, but not the way the economists look at it.  But find, rather, what--why the, you know, the economic struggles are wrong or don't [unintelligible] pretty well, so stuff like that.
0:40 0:44 FEMALE:  But why would you study that through sociology?  It seems like you would study that through economics.
0:44 0:52 MALE:  Yeah, but you see, there are kind of differences of opinions what's going on in economy.  So economists think about, you know, people as being rational--
0:53 0:53 FEMALE:  Right.
0:52 0:53 MALE:  --and pursuing their interests and stuff.
0:53 0:53 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:53 0:56 MALE:  And that is how economic models are built.
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Right.
0:56 1:11 MALE:  But sociologists say, well it's not always true.  People, you know, help each other, and help parents, and, uh, you know, do other things for each other, uh, you know, fall into this line of kind of seeking your own interests, so.
1:12 1:27 FEMALE:  But it seems like the economic's model would have the advantage of you can actually come up with predictions and outputs.  But if you factor in, you know, people are altruistic, that they like to help other people, I mean, it doesn't seem like you can actually develop a model based on that.  So how--I mean, what do you do then?
1:27 1:54 MALE:  That's--in my view, that's the big problem, is economic [unintelligible], is just that it's blah, blah, blah, and you know, economics are wrong.  But we don't have any better model.  But, uh, if you take it serious to them, some people have proposed how we can, you know, suggest maybe models which, uh, kind of incorporate economic models, but still they allow for the things which are, you know, kind of sociologists point out.  So basically it calls for new search of models.
1:56 2:05 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  That's really, really interesting.  Could you--people who do people who do economic sociology tend to be more on the left wing of the political spectrum, or tend to be more [unintelligible]?
2:04 2:21 MALE:  I think all sociologists pretty much on the left wing, yeah.  Well except with this one guy in our department, who is very conservative, I mean, very Republican.  And you know, he's proud to be Republican and stuff.  And he's like, you know, a unique case.  [laughter] Everybody knows about you.
2:23 2:26 FEMALE:  Right.  I'm sure.  I'm sure everybody knows about him.
2:25 2:25 MALE:  Yeah.  I uh--
2:28 2:30 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  That's really, really funny.
2:29 2:31 MALE:  So what kind of area of law are you interested in?
2:33 2:34 FEMALE:  Um, I'm not quite sure yet.  Um--
2:33 2:33 MALE:  You are first year?
2:35 2:44 FEMALE:  I'm a first year.  I think that I probably want to either work for the government, or I think I want to enter legal academia.  I think it would be fun to be a professor.
2:43 2:43 MALE:  Really?
2:44 2:45 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.
2:44 2:44 MALE:  Do you like to teach?
2:46 2:56 FEMALE:  Um, I love teaching.  I used to be--I'm a failed graduate student [laughter].  And I used to, you know, be a TA.  And I love--I really love teaching.  It's great when you, you know, when you connect with your--do you TA?
2:55 2:55 MALE:  Yeah.
2:57 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I mean, it's a pain in the ass when you grade papers, and you're like, holy shit.  I went over this 20 times.  How could they not get it right?  How could they not get it?  And you feel like you failed as a teacher.
3:06 3:06 MALE:  Yeah.
3:07 3:14 FEMALE:  But I mean, it's really fun interacting with the students.  And you get a couple bright students that come into your office hours and ask you really good, hard questions and--
3:13 3:14 MALE:  Right, right, right.
3:15 3:22 FEMALE:  I remember, I had this one student who wrote me the most gorgeous paper.  I mean, the most--I [unintelligible].
3:21 3:21 MALE:  It wasn't a love letter?
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  What's that?
3:22 3:23 MALE:  It wasn't a love letter?
3:24 3:37 FEMALE:  No, no, no, no.  It was just a really good philosophy paper.  I mean, I literally tracked him down.  I was like, "You need to enter philosophy as a major.  Are you a philosopher?"  I'm like, "You need to just go to graduate school."  Like you--it's just when you see a young mind like that, and you want to mold them.
3:37 3:37 MALE:  Right.
3:39 3:50 FEMALE:  But as a legal academic, I mean, I really feel like I'm molding anyone [unintelligible].  I just [laughter].  I mean, if I entered legal academia, it'd just be for the hours, and you know, the freedom, the flexibility.
3:49 3:51 MALE:  Yeah?  So what do you teach?  Law?
3:52 3:53 FEMALE:  Something in the law.  I don't know what.  I don't know.  
3:56 3:56 MALE:  Interesting.  Very nice meeting you.
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you too.
