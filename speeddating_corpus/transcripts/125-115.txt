01:02  	01:03  	MALE:  Oh, where you come from?

01:03  	01:11  	FEMALE:  Um, Rochester, New York.  Although I lived in Massachusetts for many years when I grew up.  So, I'm from the cold.

01:11  	01:14  	MALE:  I know.  Yeah, it's so nice here.

01:14  	01:16  	FEMALE:  It's fantastic.  How about you?  Have you been here for a long time?

01:16  	01:24  	MALE:  I've been here for two and half years.  So, I tell you this is probably the only place I know in the U.S.

01:24  	01:25  	FEMALE:  Oh really.  Where are you from?

01:26  	01:27  	MALE:  I'm I mean -- I come from Spain. 

01:27  	01:29  	FEMALE:  Okay.  So, [Spanish language].

01:29  	01:32  	MALE:  [Spanish Language].  Actually I was --

01:32  	01:37  	FEMALE:  I don't Spanish, Spanish; I speak bad Latin American [laughter].

01:38  	01:46  	MALE:   You know what [unintelligible] I thought I was going to speak Spanish with another girt and then I realized that they probably wouldn't understand [unintelligible].

01:46  	01:48  	FEMALE:  That's right.  That's right, they wouldn't, just grew up [unintelligible].

01:49  	01:53  	MALE:  I know.  They would have to -- they would need translator, right?

01:53  	01:53  	FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

01:54  	01:55  	MALE:  Yeah, that's funny [laughter].

01:55  	01:55  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

01:57  	01:58  	MALE:  So you speak pretty well, right?

01:58  	02:10  	FEMALE:  Well, I lived in Costa Rica for a year and I lived in Chile for two months.  And I've done a lot of work with Spanish speaking kids.  So I've just sort of [unintelligible] picking it up, so.  

02:11  	02:11  	MALE:  Oh, that's very good.

02:11  	02:17  	FEMALE:  But it's funny because, whenever I listen to someone who speaks like real [unintelligible] Spanish, it's like oh I don't speak really good Spanish at all do I [laughter].

02:17  	02:19  	MALE:  Well, it's just a different dialect.

02:19  	02:20  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's another dialect, but I also when I lived in Costa Rica I was living -- I was teaching and I was living way out in a rural area in the country.  So it's kind of learning how cotton picker Spanish rather than -- like my Spanish is not an educated, but [unintelligible] Spanish.

02:38  	02:42  	MALE:  Well, you probably -- [unintelligible] news.

02:42  	02:43  	FEMALE:  Yeah, I can, yeah.

02:43  	02:59  	MALE:  Yeah, that's very -- because even if you go to Spain, that doesn't mean you are going to end up speaking with people who speak very correctly, you know.  There are a lot of people who speak very badly in Spain.  So I think if you listen to the news that's a good idea.  

02:59  	03:03  	FEMALE:  Okay, yeah. I should do that more.  I try to speak Spanish whenever I can.

03:03  	03:04  	MALE:  You try to?

03:05  	03:06  	FEMALE:  I try to read books in Spanish, whenever I can.

03:06  	03:08  	MALE:  Oh, so what kind of books do you like the most?

03:08  	03:13  	FEMALE:  I usually read like Harry Potter and sort of other children's books. 

03:13  	03:14  	MALE:  Ah-huh.

03:14  	03:22  	FEMALE:  I tried to read like [unintelligible], but it's just -- that's so complex.  But, you know I get more out of that when I read it in English.

03:23  	03:40  	MALE:  Okay, that sounds like research with Spanish [unintelligible] books are not so complicated I think.  Like the vocabulary.  Have you heard of the [unintelligible] or [unintelligible].  They are really good and some of their books have so short, so, so short believe and so good. Yeah you should --

03:40  	03:46  	FEMALE:  That's probably right.  I definitely need to practice.

03:46  	04:04  	MALE:  Yeah, you should give it a try.  Like one of them was [unintelligible] you know and they are pretty good books.  I mean, it's because of the content that they are good rather than -- I mean it's not because they use very weird grammar or [horn] [unintelligible], you know.  You should give it a try.  Okay.

04:04  	04:05  	FEMALE:  Well, it was nice to meet you.  

04:05  	04:06  	MALE:  Nice to meet you too.

04:05  	04:09  	FEMALE:  Sorry all we talked about was like my reading in Spanish.

04:09  	04:11  	MALE:  Oh, no, no, that was very interesting.  Okay, see you.

04:11  	04:12  	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
