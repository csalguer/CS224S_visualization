0:15 0:15 MALE:  Good to meet you.  
0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  You too.  
0:16 0:18 MALE:  So, what are you doing at Stanford?  
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  I'm studying economics.  
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Oh, okay.  What year are you? 
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  Second.  
0:22 0:26 MALE:  Second year, okay.  I know a few people in econ.  So, that's cool.  How is that going for you?  
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  It's getting better.  
0:29 0:30 MALE:  Getting better?  
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:30 0:32 MALE:  A lot of coursework and stuff like that? 
0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  yeah, yeah, it will be mostly over.  
0:36 0:42 MALE:  That's cool.  I'm in mechanical engineering.  It's my fifth year.  So, I've been here for a little bit of--
0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Oh.  
0:42 0:44 MALE:  Uh-oh, you got that stunned look.  
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Fifth year?  
0:45 0:49 MALE:  It's been fun, a really good place.  Where did you come from before Stanford?  
0:45 0:45 FEMALE:  Indianapolis.  
0:49 0:52 MALE:  Indianpolis, okay.  Is that were you're from originally?  
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:53 0:53 MALE:  How do you like it out here?  
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  I like the weather.  
0:55 0:55 MALE: Yeah.  That's cool.
0:52 0:54 FEMALE:  Are you from this area around here?  
0:58 1:18 MALE:  I'm from Los Angeles.  So, it's actually better than Los Angeles.  That's my take on it.  I like to do a lot of outdoorsy things.  This is one of the best places. You can go skiing.  I do a lot of cycling so this is a great place to do that.  Yeah, what do you like to do besides Econ?  
1:15 1:17 FEMALE:  Well, I like to cook.  
1:21 1:23 MALE:  Yeah, oh excellent.  
1:19 1:23 FEMALE:  And I like hiking, but I got [unintelligible].  
1:27 1:27 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
1:24 1:27 FEMALE:  During the year, I don't know, the first two years there hasn't been much time.  
1:31 1:32 MALE:  It's pretty tough, yeah.  
1:30 1:34 FEMALE:  There's just not a lot of flexibility in your schedule so you can't sit around, but next year.  
1:38 1:46 MALE:  Next year, definitely, yeah.  So, where--sorry, what area of econ are you interested in?  Do you know?  
1:42 1:44 FEMALE:  I'm interested in industrial organization.  
1:48 1:53 MALE:  Okay. Okay.  Sure.  That's a pretty popular area if I recall.  
1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, well Stanford is really good at it.  It's a [unintelligible] school.  
1:57 2:01 MALE:  Okay, that's cool.  Do you know nameX or nameX [phonetic]?  They're third year I think. 
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, I know them.  
2:02 2:11 MALE: Okay, yeah, I know them from [unintelligible] associations.  That's cool.  So, uh, I don't know.  You can ask me some questions too.  
2:09 2:14 FEMALE:  So, what--you mentioned you like going outdoors.  What else do you enjoy?  
2:18 2:27 MALE:  I do a lot of cycling.  I also--I like doing kind of hiking.  I did a lot of backpacking when I was an undergrad, and like I led some of these orientation trips.  And that was a lot of fun.  
2:24 2:26 FEMALE:  Okay.  Did you go to college [unintelligible]?  
2:31 2:31 MALE:  I went to--
2:27 2:29 FEMALE: [interposing]  You're the guy who went to college with nameX?  
2:33 2:34 MALE:  Ah, okay.  
2:30 2:30 FEMALE:  Are you his friend?  
2:35 2:46 MALE:  Yes, we went to school together.  So, we both went to Princeton.  That's how we know nameX actually.  So, yeah, I was part of the outdoor action program there.  We'd [unintelligible] and do our own treads.  That was a lot of fun.  
2:43 2:47 FEMALE:  I had a roommate I think that did some kind of [unintelligible] trip for orientation.  
2:51 2:52 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:50 2:52 FEMALE: I really was [unintelligible], and she was going back to [unintelligible].  
2:56 3:00 MALE:  Oh, okay.  That's cool.  Excellent.  
2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  So, yeah.
3:01 3:07 MALE:  So, yeah, the first year is a pretty good year.  I can imagine.  I remember first year in [unintelligible].  
3:04 3:05 FEMALE:  You're in mechanical?  
3:10 3:13 MALE: I'm in mechanical engineering, yeah.  So, I'm trying to figure out what to do next sort of.  
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  So you're looking for a job?  
3:17 3:31 MALE:  Supposed to be.  I'm sort of enjoying myself.  It's road-racing season right now.  So, we're in the midst of that, or cycling.  So, it's just--sorry.  I jumped away.  I've been sort of not doing as much research as my advisor would like.  
3:27 3:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, first when I thought of road racing I thought of cars and--
3:35 3:41 MALE:  Oh, no, no--on a bike.  On a bike.  So, I've been doing a bunch of that racing.  
3:37 3:40 FEMALE:  So, where do you go for that, around the [unintelligible] ?  
3:44 3:58 MALE:  You can go up to skyline.  You can go up Old Bahanda [phonetic] or up Page Mill.  Any of those routes that go up the skyline or just around this area.  And then there's actually a western collegiate cycling conference that a bunch of schools in California in Nevada [unintelligible].  
3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  That you work out with.  
3:59 4:02 MALE: Yeah, there's a cycling [unintelligible].  It's open to grads and undergrads.  
3:58 3:59 FEMALE:  Oh, okay. 
4:03 4:16 MALE:  Yeah, so it's a club sport. So, it's a lot of fun definitely.  I don't know if that's us or not.  I guess it does.  I see people.  
4:12 4:15 FEMALE:  There's a lot of ambiguity here.  
4:23 4:24 MALE:  I think we're going to get pushed over.  
4:21 4:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Anyway.  
4:33 4:34 MALE:  It's good meeting you, female133.
