0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  I [unintelligible] the sound.  
0:03 0:06 MALE:  Yeah, I don't like it.  I don't like loud sounds like that either.  
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  I'm female136.  
0:08 0:08 MALE:  I'm male104.  
0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  Do you have friends that live in studio three?  
0:11 0:12 MALE:  Yeah, I do.  
0:11 0:13 FEMALE:  I think we might live on the same floor?  
0:14 0:14 MALE:  Oh, is that right?  
0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:15 0:16 MALE:  Which room do you live in?  
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  Q10.  
0:19 0:21 MALE:  All right, I'm Q[unintelligible].  
0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  The ones on the corner.  
0:24 0:25 MALE:  Have you got plants in front of your room?  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE: I did for a while.  It was really dead.  
0:28 0:28 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  I put it outside my door because it was dead.  
0:31 0:34 MALE:  Oh, I thought it was really cool.  I was going to like knock on your door and ask you about it.  
0:34 0:34 FEMALE:  Oh really?  
0:36 0:37 MALE:  I didn't know who lived there or anything.  
0:36 0:37 FEMALE:  Oh, sweet.  It was a really little--
0:38 0:50 MALE:  [interposing] Yeah, it was really little, and it looked really dead, but I just liked that there was a plant sitting there.  I was just going to say like, hey, your plant looks like shit.  [laughter]
0:52 1:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, I knew that.  That's why it was out there, and I could--I'm not sure why I left it out there for so long.  It was kind of forlorn.  I definitely wasn't like making any statement by having a dead plant.  
1:10 1:15 MALE:  No, it didn't look so horrible that it looked like that.  It didn't look that sad really.  
1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  Oh, good.  
1:19 1:22 MALE:  Cause the [unintelligible] show that are happy that there was a plant there.  Like someone to talk to I guess.  
1:21 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, maybe I should put something out there again.  
1:26 1:28 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, put some more dead plants.  [unintelligible].  
1:28 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, well I mean nobody has ever knocked on my door because of my dead plant.  
1:35 1:39 MALE:  Yeah, I was really--I was going to.  I didn't--I guess it just disappeared.  
1:39 1:41 FEMALE: Yeah, it did.  It needed to go.  
1:42 1:50 MALE: I was going to knock on someone's door like on the short part of the hall because they're always leaving their slippers outside.  
1:49 1:49 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:51 1:54 MALE:  I was going to ask them about that, but again I didn't do that either.  
1:54 1:56 FEMALE:  What would you ask about their slippers? 
1:57 2:03 MALE: I think I would command them to move their slippers inside.  It wouldn't be much of a question.  
2:03 2:05 FEMALE:  So you don't like slippers outside?  
2:07 2:12 MALE:  No, I just have a desire to command people things in the hall because no one talks to me.  
2:11 2:19 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  You're right, it's a very [unintelligible] hall, but it's even--it's so rare to even find someone.  
2:20 2:23 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, no one lives--I've never seen the guy to my left.  
2:23 2:26 FEMALE:  That's really weird.  Okay, so you're--
2:28 2:30 MALE:  [interposing]  I'm right next to the elevator.  
2:29 2:36 FEMALE:  Okay, great.  Now that we've gotten that whole Studio Three thing--
2:37 2:40 MALE: [interposing]  Actually, while we're on the subject, do you have a lot of thumping on your ceiling?  
2:41 2:44 FEMALE:  Sometimes.  Do you? 
2:45 2:45 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:46 2:47 FEMALE:  It's not the same person.  
2:49 2:54 MALE:  No, but the only--the biggest social interaction I've had is by going upstairs and yelling at the guy--
2:54 2:54 FEMALE: [interposing]  Oh really?  
2:56 2:57 MALE:  For stomping on my ceiling all night.  
2:57 2:58 FEMALE:  In the middle of the night this happens?  
3:00 3:06 MALE:  He goes from about eight to maybe four in the morning.  He's just like jumping around.  
3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  Like exercising.  
3:08 3:10 MALE:  Well, him and his girlfriend live up there, so--
3:10 3:11 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Oh, she lives there too?  
3:13 3:15 MALE:  Yeah, so I don't know what they're doing all night.  
3:14 3:20 FEMALE:  Don't want to.  Maybe he's dating the woman who lives above me.  
3:22 3:22 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:24 3:31 FEMALE:  Actually last semester I think the woman who lives above me broke up with her boyfriend because I heard the expletives.  
3:33 3:34 MALE: Uh-huh.
3:38 3:43 FEMALE: But there's not a lot of stomping.  Are you from California or from another country?  
3:43 3:47 MALE:  I went to undergrad at Florida?  
3:47 3:50 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  Is that--what part of the country?  
3:51 3:56 MALE:  Well, I--so I was born in New York, but I lived in Florida for a pretty long time.  What about you?  
3:55 4:02 FEMALE:  My family is [unintelligible].  So, I missed the [unintelligible] up here.  
4:03 4:04 MALE:  Yeah, mine too.  
4:04 4:08 FEMALE:  Well, it's really nice meeting you.  Take care.  I'm sure I'll talk to you.  
4:09 4:11 MALE:  All right, cool.  See you.
