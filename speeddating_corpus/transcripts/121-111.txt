1:23 1:25 MALE: Well that's pretty good for history.

1:23 1:27 FEMALE: She just keeps just like, you know, extending it, and extending it.

1:28 1:30 MALE: Historians I think have it way harder than physical sciences.

1:54 1:59 MALE: Are you going to go on to do something more education, school, or are you going to work next year.

1:58 2:21 FEMALE: No, I need to get a job to pay these people back.  [laughter]  Pay them all the money I just borrowed-I just borrowed from them.  Yeah um, no it's um, there are a number of different masters programs and I'm doing one in policy and organization, and leadership studies.  It's this long title.  And so I'll try to find a job in the city working for a non-profit, yeah, that's like supporting districts.

2:22 2:23 MALE: You live there now or do you--?

2:22 2:23 FEMALE: No, I live on campus.

2:24 2:25 MALE: Okay.  Yeah.

2:23 2:25 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.

2:25 2:27 MALE: So do you know where you're going to move in San Francisco yet or--? 

2:26 2:28 FEMALE: No, because I need to get a job first.

2:29 2:32 MALE: Yeah right, that's a difficult uh, chicken and egg thing.  But uh--

2:31 2:42 FEMALE: It is terrifying.  I know.  And we have to decide--we have to decide in the next week if I stay through the summer in my housing, which is really stressful. 

2:42 2:44 MALE: Yeah we got the email like--

2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Right.

2:45 2:48 MALE: We're about like--I'm like I don't know where I'll be next winter or the fall.  Like uh--

2:53 2:53 FEMALE: Exactly.

2:55 2:56 MALE: [unintelligible] 

2:55 3:10 FEMALE: It's okay.  I just have to decide and I feel like if I decide that's when I'll get a job, and I'll want to move somewhere else, and then I'll be committed through the summer, but if I don't take it then I don't know where I'll go the day after graduation.  [laughter]  So it's just sort of like how exposed am I willing to feel for a while.  Yeah.

3:07 3:15 MALE: Right, right.  Risky.  Like, can I really just like you know crash [unintelligible] for a month or--

3:13 3:16 FEMALE: And they've offered and I don't really want to.

3:41 3:43 MALE: That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I mean, I don't know.

3:42 3:48 FEMALE: Well it is sort of except that I'm-I'm starting to stress out.  So I want [crosstalk] you know what I mean?  

3:48 3:53 MALE: Okay, that's [laughter]  Right, right, right.  Not like hoping that the friend of a friend will come through with that random thing that just, you know--

3:50 3:56 FEMALE: Right, yeah.  Two months ago that sounded like a really reasonable plan but right now it's like, you know.

3:58 4:00 MALE: I'm sure something will come through.  I mean that like [horn] 

3:58 3:59 FEMALE: I hope so.

4:01 4:04 MALE: Something where like, by definition, a lot of [unintelligible]
