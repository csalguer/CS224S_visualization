0:00:12.9 0:00:17.0 FEMALE:  This quarter I'm taking, um, image sensors with Algamol. And- 
0:00:20.5 0:00:21.8 MALE:  Oh that's a hard one.
0:00:17.7 0:00:20.6 FEMALE:  Yeah. [laughter] nameX and I are taking it together, so- [laughter]

0:00:29.2 0:00:29.8 MALE:  Okay.
0:00:24.8 0:00:26.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Classmates.
0:00:30.6 0:00:31.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:26.6 0:00:34.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And then I'm taking, um- oh, a materials sciences class.  It's like electrical and optical properties of- of materials.
0:00:39.1 0:00:39.7 MALE:  Okay.
0:00:35.1 0:00:42.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And then, um, medical technologies dealing with gastrointestinal  diseases.

0:00:42.9 0:00:45.7 FEMALE:  [laughter]  Yeah. 
0:00:47.5 0:00:52.7 MALE:  So that's an [unintelligible].  Yeah, so, yeah, what else?
0:00:50.9 0:00:54.1 FEMALE:  Um- I'm- thank you.  Yeah.
0:00:55.4 0:01:02.5 MALE:  I would like- [unintelligible] Yeah, so what do you do in your free time or something like that?  You don't get free time I guess with all those classes, right?
0:00:58.4 0:01:01.3 FEMALE:  Um, not as much as I would like.  [laughter] 
0:01:04.5 0:01:06.0 MALE:  Yeah.  Definitely.
0:01:01.8 0:01:07.0 FEMALE:  But it's better than fall quarter.  I'd have to say when I was taking two sixty- I took two sixty three and two seventy eight fall quarter. 
0:01:11.2 0:01:13.0 MALE:  How was the final, two sixty three?
0:01:09.0 0:01:11.9 FEMALE:  Uh, [laughter] 
0:01:15.1 0:01:16.1 MALE:  [laughter] 
0:01:12.0 0:01:13.5 FEMALE:  Uh, uh, [laughter] 
0:01:17.2 0:01:18.8 MALE:  Okay.  [laughter]  It's, a-
0:01:13.8 0:01:16.6 FEMALE:  The midterm was much better for me.  [unintelligible] 
0:01:19.7 0:01:21.7 MALE:  Oh, definitely, for everybody.  Yeah.
0:01:16.3 0:01:25.5 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] I got to the point where I was drawing little pictures on my exam because I didn't know what else to do at that point.  [laughter]  
0:01:27.5 0:01:31.8 MALE:  Yeah.  Well that's, uh, good.  [laughter] 
0:01:27.2 0:01:30.1 FEMALE:  So I decided two sixty three was good for me and-
0:01:34.2 0:01:37.8 MALE:  And you- you want to- you did- you didn't want to go to [unintelligible] 
0:01:33.7 0:01:39.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I- I thought it would be a good experience if I did, but then I [unintelligible] 
0:01:41.8 0:01:44.1 MALE:  But it's- it's okay, you are in your first year and-
0:01:39.7 0:01:40.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:44.2 0:01:46.9 MALE:  So you are doing- you would be doing your PhD here?
0:01:42.9 0:01:43.7 FEMALE:  Um-
0:01:47.7 0:01:48.6 MALE:  Not decided.  
0:01:44.6 0:01:47.3 FEMALE:  I ki- well I'm leaning towards the master's.
0:01:52.1 0:01:52.9 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:01:47.0 0:01:58.6 FEMALE:  So, yeah, I came in as undecided and I'm- I'm not really sure if I am like cut out for a PhD.  So I think it- I probably need a couple of years to work- 
0:02:02.8 0:02:03.4 MALE:  Oh okay.
0:01:58.4 0:02:02.3 FEMALE:  -and figure out if it's something I want.  And if it is then I'll come back. 
0:02:05.4 0:02:08.9 MALE:  So you are- you are in your first year right now or second- okay.
0:02:04.3 0:02:05.0 FEMALE:  First year. 
0:02:09.7 0:02:11.4 MALE:  Well you have another year then.
0:02:07.2 0:02:11.0 FEMALE:  Yeah. [laughter] Another year to figure it out.  Yeah.   
0:02:13.8 0:02:19.6 MALE:  Uh-huh.  So- uh, like you did your undergrad also in Ca- somewhere in California [unintelligible] 
0:02:15.0 0:02:16.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, I went to UC San Diego.
0:02:21.0 0:02:23.9 MALE:  Oh San Diego.  Oh god, San Diego is a very nice place I guess.
0:02:17.5 0:02:20.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:02:24.3 0:02:27.3 MALE:  You must have a lot of time there to enjoy San Diego.
0:02:23.3 0:02:25.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter]  
0:02:27.3 0:02:31.2 MALE:  Uh, a- like as compared to Stanford grad school.
0:02:27.4 0:02:35.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And- well I think the first year- I hear the first year at Stanford grad school is like- like especially the first quarter is really rigorous and then it gets better right. 
0:02:38.3 0:02:39.0 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:35.2 0:02:37.3 FEMALE:  Right?  I mean is that your experience too?
0:02:39.8 0:02:42.5 MALE:  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  
0:02:37.7 0:02:43.9 FEMALE:  Yeah, so, and in undergrad you have a bit more time to explore and it's four years [unintelligible] instead so- 
0:02:46.4 0:02:52.1 MALE:  Right.  So you're- you're hometown [unintelligible] in California somewhere.
0:02:47.9 0:02:52.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, um, I'm originally from San Jose.  So it's like a half an hour drive home. 
0:02:54.7 0:02:58.1 MALE:  Oh.  So, so you actually came back home and started-
0:02:53.5 0:02:59.1 FEMALE:  [laughter] Probably one of the few people who like moves closer to home for graduate school but- 
0:03:02.1 0:03:03.8 MALE:  Well, oh, it's good.  
0:02:59.6 0:03:02.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.  My parents were really excited.  [laughter]  
0:03:05.8 0:03:08.8 MALE:  So you, uh, often spend your weekends at home or something?
0:03:05.4 0:03:08.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, fall quarter especially I would just be like okay-
0:03:12.4 0:03:12.9 MALE:  Oh.
0:03:08.8 0:03:13.0 FEMALE:  -just go home and pick up a load of food for the following week and-
0:03:16.9 0:03:18.3 MALE:  Oh that is so nice.
0:03:13.2 0:03:15.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] 
0:03:18.8 0:03:19.7 MALE:  [laughter] 
0:03:15.5 0:03:21.9 FEMALE:  My mom was always like, okay, are you coming home this weekend and I'll cook a lot, so-  It's good.  It's a nice deal. 
0:03:23.6 0:03:28.1 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah, and she w- sh- she would have missed that during your undergrad so-
0:03:24.1 0:03:25.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.
0:03:28.7 0:03:33.4 MALE:  Yeah, at least for this first year you can enjoy that.  Then it will go on decreasing maybe.
0:03:29.3 0:03:32.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So where did you grow up and do your undergrad? 
0:03:35.5 0:03:47.0 MALE:  Oh, I- I'm- I'm from India and, uh, I came to the U.S. at like three years ago.  I'm in my third year now [unintelligible] at Stanford.  So that was the first time [unintelligible] 
0:03:41.4 0:03:43.8 FEMALE:  Okay.  Okay. 
0:03:47.7 0:03:50.0 MALE:  And, um, I'm enjoying it since.
0:03:46.2 0:03:49.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Do you want to stay in the states after you finish or go back to India?
0:03:54.0 0:04:00.8 MALE:  Um, not- not necessarily decided.  But yeah, lots- like if you actually get a PhD or something-
0:04:00.0 0:04:00.7 [horn]
0:04:00.5 0:04:09.8 MALE:  -then your work is more useful and like you can- you have the appropriate work in the United States rather than in India.  So that's one factor which will decide.
0:04:02.4 0:04:03.2 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.   
@0:04:10.6 0:04:11.7 MALE:  Okay, nice meeting you.
@0:04:07.6 0:04:08.7 FEMALE:  Nice to see you.
