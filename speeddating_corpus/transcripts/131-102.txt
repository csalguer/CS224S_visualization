FILE NAME: Male Speaker 102 -- Female Speaker 131


0:02 0:03 MALE:  Hi, I'm male102.  
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  I'm female131. 
0:03 0:04 MALE:  Nice to meet you, female131.  
0:24 0:27 FEMALE:  [laughter]  Now that we went all formal [unintelligible].  
0:09 0:11 MALE:  Yeah.  So, what program are you in here?  
0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.  
0:14 0:14 MALE:  Cool.  
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  I'm a first-year student here.  
0:16 0:21 MALE:  I'm a second-year in the ed school doctoral program in the philosophy of education.  
0:42 0:46 FEMALE:  Great.  You know what, I actually met a professor at the ed school on a plane.  
0:27 0:27 MALE:  Really?  
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean do you know all the professors?  
0:30 0:31 MALE:  Yeah, it's a fairly small school.  I know most of them.  
0:52 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, I didn't want to say anything.  He was old, like really old, and he does a lot of the stuff on art and education.  
0:38 0:39 MALE:  Elliott Eisner?  	
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  Old guy.  
0:41 0:42 MALE:  He's the only guy who does art and education.  
1:02 1:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, he's been making--
0:44 0:45 MALE:  [interposing]  He's huge.  
1:05 1:07 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] the heart of education.  
0:47 0:55 MALE:  That's so random, yeah.  I mean he's the only person here that really does that stuff, but he's like the biggest name right now probably in the country doing art education.  
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:55 0:58 MALE:  Yeah, he's an interesting character.  
1:18 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean he basically [unintelligible] was like, yeah, you are the guy I would like to [unintelligible] to meet him.  He was a friendly guy.  
1:03 1:03 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:24 1:26 FEMALE:  I don't know if you've had that.  Have you had [unintelligible] yet?  
1:06 1:08 MALE:  I haven't.  A lot of my friends have taken classes with him though.  
1:29 1:40 FEMALE:  It was like really fresh and [unintelligible] like [unintelligible] intellectual conversations.  It was very unexpected.  I guess they didn't want every [unintelligible].  
1:20 1:21 MALE:  Where were you flying from and to?  
1:41 1:44 FEMALE:  Everybody's a convert.  I was going back to Connecticut.  
1:27 1:28 MALE:  So, it was along flight.  
1:48 1:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I mean I don't think it--it must not have been a direct.  Surely there was probably a layover in Chicago or Denver.  
1:33 1:34 MALE:  Oh, I bet.  
1:55 1:58 FEMALE:  So, you're not doing art in education?  
1:38 2:05 MALE:  No, I don't do art, or aesthetics, or any of that stuff.  I do a lot more philosophy of science sort of stuff.  I'm interested in like a philosophy of education research.  So, how people study education, and what the philosophical issues are in looking at education from a lot of different disciplinary perspectives and the role that values, and beliefs, and politics play in research methods was very interesting to me and how--
2:25 2:28 FEMALE:  Isn't that kind of like [unintelligible] critical?  
2:09 2:18 MALE:  I--yeah, I wouldn't describe myself as a [unintelligible].  I would say I'm more in the analytic philosophy tradition.  So...
2:38 2:42 FEMALE:  I don't even know exactly what the terms mean except that they critique things.  
2:22 2:51 MALE:  That's all right.  I think a lot of people in this who do them don't know what they mean exactly either because they're not always consistent in their positions about things.  But, yeah, I'm very interested in those sorts of issues, in taking more philosophy of science sort of stuff a little bit--the post-modernists tend to be a little bit more sociology of knowledge type stuff.  They're a little bit too relativistic, I guess, for sort of how I think about things, which--
3:11 3:16 FEMALE:  So, it's not so much the ethics or philosophy as like--
2:57 3:31 MALE:  Well, it is in the sense that I'm sort of interested in how they--for instance, how should we--how should research priorities be set? And how should values and ethical beliefs because there's a lot of people who get interested in education research that have very strong political/moral views about things.  And that affects the way they do research, and so I'm interested in how that shapes the way they do research, how they take criticism of the research as a result of that, uhm, to what extent that there are legitimate ways that those values and ethical views can operate.  And there's a lot of them, I think, and in what ways they can be illegitimate and can undermine the credibility and integrity of research.  
3:51 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, it actually seems like it would be much more project [unintelligible] high philosophy.  
3:40 3:41 MALE:  That's why I like it.  
4:01 4:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:42 3:45 MALE:  That's why I got interested in the philosophy of ed.  It seemed more practical and not abstract.  
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Do you want to like work on policy issues?  
3:48 3:58 MALE:  I'm very interested in that.  I'm interested partly in how research gets used to shape and justify policy.  So, it's kind of [unintelligible].  It was very nice meeting you.  I didn't get to ask you at all about yourself.  
4:18 4:23 FEMALE2:  [unintelligible]
