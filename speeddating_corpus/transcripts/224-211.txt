0:10 0:18 MALE:  No, no.  That's fine, that's fine.  That's fine.  I don't know, I just can't create on a one to ten scale.  So I just think and--
0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  [laughter] Did you put it in the middle?  
0:22 0:27 MALE:  No I mean, I think I don't divide it into like three parts then [unintelligible] or something like that.

0:35 0:35 FEMALE:  It's hard to keep up. 
0:36 0:38 MALE: Mm-hmm. That's why they make you do this, like take a minute and, you know, before you forget the other guy.   
0:39 0:43 FEMALE:  I know but the minute, you're so rushed that you don't have a time to like stop and relax and--
0:44 0:44 MALE:  Yeah.

0:45 0:45 MALE:  They should have like a break or something.  
0:46 0:50 FEMALE:  I know they should have a break, because I think we're almost finished with the people who are coming through.  
0:51 0:51 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
0:51 0:54 FEMALE:  Unless they're bringing in a whole new cart of people, but I don't think so.  
0:55 0:55 MALE:  No, I don't think so. 
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  [laughter] I think this is it.  
0:57 0:57 MALE:  This is it. 
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  So um, which program are you in? 
0:59 1:02 MALE:  I'm in the business school, in the PhD program.  
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  I'm in the business school too, but not the PhD program. 
1:05 1:05 MALE:  You're an MBA? 
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  An MBA. 
1:07 1:07 MALE:  Okay. Okay. 
1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Which professors do you work with? 
1:09 1:10 MALE:  Uh, [unintelligible].  
1:11 1:16 FEMALE:  I am, am I taking his, does he teach the technology class?  
1:17 1:18 MALE:  No, oh yeah, he does actually.  
1:19 1:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, I have him this term.  The reason I'm not sure is, I think it's him, because I just had the first class yesterday.  
1:25 1:27 MALE:  Oh okay, yeah he started teaching yesterday.  
1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  Yesterday? Yes, I am taking a class with your professor.  
1:31 1:31 MALE:  Oh my God.  [laughter]  
1:32 1:33 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:34 1:34 MALE:  I have to watch my words here. 
1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Professor, this student of yours... 
1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  He's really funny. 
1:38 1:38 MALE:  Yeah he is.  
1:39 1:43 FEMALE:  He's a lot of--did you know that you were going to work specifically with him when you started? 
1:44 1:50 MALE:  Uh, I didn't, I didn't know of him before, but like I started working with him at the end of my first year and uh--
1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  So how many years are you into the program? 
1:53 1:53 MALE:  This is my fourth year. 
1:54 1:57 FEMALE:  Wow.  That's dedication.  [laughter] 
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Not really. [laughter] 
1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Well because we only have two years. 
2:00 2:04 MALE:  What makes you think I'm dedicated, maybe it's like I'm slacking off so it's taking me longer.  
2:05 2:14 FEMALE:  It's dedication because you're saying I'm going to be in school for like this long and, but hey the more that I'm in school, the more I'm like I'll stay in school as long as I can. 
2:15 2:24 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  That's what everyone tells you, like I mean, the time you're in school is the best time.  So you know, enjoy it, it gets worse, so you know.  Plus the job market also is peculiar, so--
2:25 2:25 FEMALE: Mm.  
2:25 2:27 MALE:  --at times there are no jobs, so you want to stay there one more year.  
2:28 2:31 FEMALE:  So you're like, oh this dissertation's taking me longer then I thought.  [laughter] 
2:32 2:36 MALE:  That's true, but unfortunately we don't get that option.  It's more like we need our advisor to sign us off in some sense. 
2:37 2:40 FEMALE:  Oh.  So which area are you--
2:41 2:45 MALE:  You should suggest [unintelligible] some day, you know, to take your professor out and  drink lots of beer.
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:46 2:48 MALE:  And then, I keep a meeting with him in the evening, get him more drunk and--
2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  Nice. 
2:49 2:49 MALE:  --will you sign this please.  
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:51 2:51 MALE:  This is just one of the--
2:51 2:55 FEMALE:  I'll work on that.  I will work on that.  [laughter] 
2:56 2:56 MALE:  You're in your first year?  Second? 
2:57 2:57 FEMALE: First year.

3:43 3:53 FEMALE:  So you're like, it's all good.  So do you guys um, in the PhD program all get together and like, do things?  Is there, is it kind of a cohesive group or do you not really hang out with the other people?  
3:54 4:00 MALE:  Oh, [unintelligible] we do hang out, but I mean, it's less social then than the MBA's.  
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  Well, I think everybody--
           [horn]
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  --less social then the MBA's.  [laughter] 
4:05 4:10 MALE:  Yeah, but um, it's, I don't know.  We hang out, but maybe not as much as we should.
