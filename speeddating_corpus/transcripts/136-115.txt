0:02 0:04 MALE:  Okay, so we're going to start here, right?  
0:02 0:08 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I feel like we should.  I mean why not?  
0:10 0:13 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] right, yeah.  So, I'm male115.  
0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  male115, I'm female136.  
0:14 0:14 MALE:  Hi.  
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:15 0:16 MALE:  Nice to meet you too.  
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  Where are you from?  
0:17 0:18 MALE:  I come from Spain.  
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  What part?  
0:19 0:20 MALE:  From Madrid?  
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Madrid?  Yeah.  
0:21 0:22 MALE:  Do you know Spain?  
0:20 0:24 FEMALE:  I have actually never been there, but it's definitely a place I would want to go.  
0:26 0:27 MALE:  Oh really, why?  Why is that?  
0:25 0:50 FEMALE:  Why?  Because actually I traveled quite a bit in Europe, and I led every place that I've been.  So, some significant gaps too in like the places that I've traveled.  And also I'm interested in the [unintelligible].  I'm also really interested in [unintelligible] more Spanish architecture.  
0:52 0:55 MALE:  Oh.  So, probably you want to go to the south?  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think so.  
0:57 0:58 MALE:  I like the south the best.  
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:59 1:00 MALE:  From Spain.  I come from Madrid, which is in the center.  
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  Right.  
1:01 1:05 MALE:  I do like Madrid a lot, but whenever I go on vacation, I always go to the south.  
1:04 1:07 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  What's your favorite part of the south?  Like, where would you recommend?  
1:10 1:14 MALE: If you were to go just a few days, I would definitely go to Granada.  
1:12 1:14 FEMALE: Granada?  Yeah.
1:16 1:18 MALE:  Granada.  So, you've heard of it.
1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  Yes.  
1:18 1:20 MALE:  Have you heard of the [unintelligible]?  
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  Yes.  
1:21 1:22 MALE:  Yeah, so you have to see that.  
1:20 1:23 FEMALE:  I was thinking of when I said I really wanted to--
1:25 1:27 MALE:  [interposing]  You cannot miss the [unintelligible].  
1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:28 1:34 MALE:  You should go to Cordoba as well.  They have the most.  It's 1,000 years old, and it's huge and really nice.  
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:35 1:59 MALE:  You should see that too.  So, this summer, in fact, I'm thinking of going close to the coast.  They are called the "White Villages" and they are kind of small villages.  They are small villages with kind of really rudimentary houses, all very nice, with very nice food and all that.  So, I want to do that route with wines and all that.  
1:58 2:00 FEMALE:  Which coast is it near?  Is it the southern coast?  
2:02 2:06 MALE:  Southern coast, south and west very close to Portugal.  
2:04 2:08 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  [unintelligible].  What are you studying here?  
2:10 2:11 MALE:  I do physics.  
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  Physics, okay.  
2:12 2:13 MALE:  How about you?  
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.  
2:15 2:16 MALE:  Oh, in the law school.  
2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:17 2:17 MALE:  What year?  
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  This is my first year.  
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Oh.  
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  How about you, how long have you been here?  
2:22 2:24 MALE:  Two and a half years.  So, this is my third year.  
2:23 2:29 FEMALE:  It's a PhD program?  What are you focusing on?  
2:32 2:38 MALE: I am focusing in--well, initially I was focusing more on theoretical physics, but then I changed into biophysics.  
2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  Biophysics, what does that mean?  
2:40 2:44 MALE:  Well, I'm doing computational studies of proteins.  
2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  Proteins.  
2:48 2:50 MALE:  Yeah, proteins.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes--
2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  Oh, no, that's okay.  
2:51 3:06 MALE:  Okay. Yeah, I enjoy that better.  Stanford is very good for that.  So, it's funny because I didn't come to Stanford for that.  But then I decided to work in that.  So, that's my story.  
3:05 3:07 FEMALE:  Cool.  What--uhm, do you like California?  
3:10 3:12 MALE:  I do.  Yeah, definitely.  
3:09 3:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:13 3:14 MALE:  Especially now that I have more time to enjoy it.  
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  At first you were really busy.  
3:17 3:29 MALE: Oh, I was extremely busy, you know.  So, I didn't have time to go to just [unintelligible] or Tahoe, Monterey, LA.  All of these places I have already visited, but I went to Las Vegas.  
3:28 3:28 FEMALE:  Oh, good.  
3:30 3:32 MALE:  Two weekends ago, and it was really nice.  
3:30 3:34 FEMALE:  Good.  Very good.  Do you live on campus [unintelligible]?  
3:37 3:38 MALE:  Yeah, I do.  How about you?  
3:36 3:37 FEMALE:  I'm on campus.  
3:39 3:40 MALE: Oh, I live in Raines?  
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Oh, in Raines, okay.  
3:42 3:42 MALE:  And you?  
3:41 3:42 FEMALE: I'm in Escandita Village.  
3:44 3:45 MALE:  Oh, that's very close.  
3:44 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
3:47 3:47 MALE:  How do you like it there? 
3:46 3:52 FEMALE:  I like it.  I live in one of the studios so I have the apartment to myself. 
3:54 3:54 MALE:  Oh, 
3:53 3:53 FEMALE:  Which is nice.  
3:56 4:00 MALE:  Yeah, that's very nice, especially this is your first year and you don't know anyone.  
3:58 4:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, and also I've lived by myself for about four years before I came here.  
4:08 4:09 MALE:  Oh, really?  
4:07 4:09 FEMALE: So, it would have been a challenge.  
4:12 4:14 MALE:  I know what you were going to say.  Okay, very--
4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
4:16 4:18 MALE:  Okay, very nice to meet you.  
4:16 4:17 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you too.  
4:19 4:19 MALE:  Okay.
