0:00 0:00 FEMALE: Hi there.  
0:02 0:03 MALE: So anyway.  Hi, female334.  How's it going?
0:02 0:02 FEMALE: Pretty good.  
0:04 0:04 MALE: Good.
0:03 0:03 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  
0:04 0:05 MALE: Good to meet you.  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE: Hey, I done before the bell, here. 
0:06 0:08 MALE: I know.  It's pretty quick.  So we are getting quicker, a little bit.
0:07 0:08 FEMALE: Yeah, a little bit. 
0:09 0:13 MALE: I don't know.  Maybe she's not ex--exactly [unintelligible] she thinks she's pretending to be.  I think sometimes [unintelligible]--
0:11 0:14 FEMALE: You give--giving us a little leeway to see how many people are still writing. 
0:15 0:26 MALE: Yeah, she might be. I don't think so.  She seems to be pretty [unintelligible], which I guess is good 'cause it'd be pretty--this is, like, the kind of things you could drag on 'til, like, midnight, if you let it.  [unintelligible] conversation.
0:23 0:26 FEMALE: That's true.  If you kind of let everybody go and--but.
0:27 0:29 MALE: [unintelligible] to get back up [unintelligible].
0:28 0:29 FEMALE: So where are you from originally?
0:31 0:31 MALE: I grew up in Portland, Oregon. 
0:31 0:31 FEMALE: Okay. 
0:32 0:35 MALE: And, uh, went to school out east and was really excited to come back out west, so--
0:36 0:36 FEMALE: Where out east?
0:38 0:38  MALE: I went to Brown.
0:37 0:39 FEMALE: Brown.  Okay.  At--
0:40 0:40 MALE: Rhode Island. 
0:39 0:41 FEMALE: Rhode Island.  How did you like Rhode Island? 
0:42 0:49 MALE: I really liked it.  It was, uh--Pro--I was in Providence.  Providence is kind of a neat town.  It's, like, like, mid-sized, but there's, like, Boston and New York close by. 
0:48 0:48 FEMALE: Right. 
0:49 0:54 MALE: If you like the big cities, and it's, it's, it's up-and-coming, you know?  Like, when I first got there, there wasn't a movie theater in the city. 
0:54 0:54 FEMALE: Really?
0:55 0:56 MALE: But, um--
0:55 0:56 FEMALE: Wow.  So how, how, how big is it?
0:58 1:03 MALE: Um, I don't know.  Like, maybe 100,000 people or something.  There's only a million people in Rhode Island. 
1:01 1:06 FEMALE: That's a--that's a pretty good size, actually.  100,000.  It's not too big, not too small. 
1:05 1:09 MALE: I mean, it's a city.  There's, like, there's, like, buildings.  Yeah, I like the size.  I don't--for sure. 
1:09 1:12 FEMALE: Yeah.  So what brings you back here, besides Stanford?
1:12 1:14 MALE: I'm in the teacher education program.  So--
1:13 1:13 FEMALE: Teaching?
1:15 1:22 MALE: Yeah.  So I decided for a while--like, after--I kind of resisted teaching for a little while after undergrad, and spent a couple years, like, teaching environmental education.
1:22 1:22 FEMALE: Um huh.
1:23 1:28 MALE: And, like, I worked for, like, a wilderness therapy program for, like, kids who have, like, drug and alcohol problems and stuff. 
1:26 1:26 FEMALE: Um huh. 
1:28 1:38 MALE: And then decided that if I really wanted to have an impact on kids, I should see them for more long-term, and, like, get a, like, you know, a year or two years with kids.  And I decided the best place to do that is in the classroom.
1:37 1:40 FEMALE: That's good.  So what specific area are you--
1:41 1:42 MALE: I teach high school math. 
1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Math.  Okay. 
1:43 1:46 MALE: What about you?  What, uh, what doing here at Stanford?
1:45 1:47 FEMALE: I'm, uh, in the PhD program in Immunology. 
1:49 1:51 MALE: Ah, immunology.  Do you know, uh, nameX?
1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Sounds familiar, but--
1:53 1:58 MALE: She used to be a second year in microbiology in the immunology program.  I don't know how [unintelligible] is. 
1:56 1:58 FEMALE: Is she still a second year?
2:00 2:01 MALE: I think so.  Yeah.  She's a second-year now.
2:01 2:04 FEMALE: Okay.  Yeah, the programs are sort of distinct, and we don't have too many classes with MNI [phonetic] people.
2:06 2:06 MALE: Okay.
2:05 2:09 FEMALE: Um, but yeah, I, I, I think I've heard her name.  I'm not really--
2:11 2:15 MALE: Oh, she was a roommate of mine in college.  So, she'll be around.  If you see her [unintelligible] Tennessee [unintelligible].
2:15 2:19 FEMALE: Okay.  That's cool.  So you said you're excited to get back to the, uh, west coast.  Why is that?
2:21 2:28 MALE: I, I just really--I mean, the east coast is great, but it's, like, a big urban wasteland.  Right?  Like, it's like, uh--in my mind, at least. 
2:28 2:28 FEMALE: [laughter] I'm from Minnesota.
2:29 2:31 MALE: It's, like, it's, like, city after the city after city after city after city, right?
2:30 2:31 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  I understand. 
2:32 2:48 MALE: Yeah.  And, um, I feel like everything's a little bit--everything's a little bit smaller, like, less grand, you know, out west.  Like, you got bigger oceans and bigger mountains and bigger--I don't know.  I like the pace out here.  I feel like it's a little bit more laid back, a little bit, so-- 
2:48 2:52 FEMALE: So if you had to live near the ocean or the mountains, which would you pick?
2:53 2:55 MALE: Oh, definitely the mountains. But, uh-- 
2:53 2:55 FEMALE: The mountains.  That's right.  Gotta go with the mountains. 
2:56 2:57 MALE: You gotta go with the mountains. 
2:56 2:57 FEMALE: Do you like to hike or outdoor stuff?
2:58 3:03 MALE: I love--yeah, I like--I'll go hiking whenenver I can, which hasn't been as much as I'd like, this year.  That's for sure.  I definitely [unintelligible].
3:03 3:06 FEMALE: I know the feeling, actually.  Yeah, I'm coming up on quals [phonetic] here, soon, so I've got--
3:07 3:08 MALE: Ewwwww.
3:07 3:08 FEMALE: Trying to get that out of the way. 
3:09 3:10 MALE: Do you have to do, like, a presentation or is it, like, a test?
3:10 3:20 FEMALE: It's both, actually.  Um, there's part one and part two.  Um, we have--part one is five essay questions, and we have, like, 72 hours to do it.  And then--
3:21 3:22 MALE: That's--whoa.  Weird.  So, like, yeah.
3:23 3:39 FEMALE: Yeah.  Uh, then we've got a research presentation, and then later on, we have to propose what we're going to do our thesis on in about four months after that.  And we have to defend it.  Basically, it's like your, your defense except pretty--four years earlier or something. 
3:41 3:42 MALE: That's intense.  
3:41 3:42 FEMALE: [laughter] Yeah. 
3:43 3:43 MALE: That's a lot to do. 
3:42 3:48 FEMALE: But once you're--once you've covered that, actually, they don't kick people out.  So it's not, not as intense as it could be, I think. 
3:50 3:50 MALE: Crazy. 
3:50 3:53 FEMALE: What about you?  Do you have some sort of [unintelligible] qualifying exam, or--
3:56 3:56 MALE: It's only a one-year program--
3:56 3:56 FEMALE: Um hm. 
3:57 4:07 MALE: So I don't have to--it's not like--we don't have to, like, defend a thesis or anything.  But with--all we have is the, um--there's, like, a teaching exam where you have to, like, teach for a week and then record--
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: Um huh. 
4:07 4:09 MALE: Videotape it and talk about what you're going to teach--
4:08 4:08 FEMALE: Right. 
4:09 4:15 MALE: And then teach it, and talk about what you taught and why it works and why it didn't work and stuff like that, so--anyway.  It's good to meet you, female334.
4:13 4:14 FEMALE: Oh.  It's good to meet you, male301.
