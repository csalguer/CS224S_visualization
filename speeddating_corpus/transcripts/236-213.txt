0:04 0:05 MALE:  female236?  

0:05 0:05 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

0:06 0:06 MALE:  Where are you from?  

0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  China.  

0:08 0:08 MALE:  China?  

0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  

0:10 0:11 MALE:  How do you say China in Chinese?  

0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  [Chinese].  

0:17 0:18 MALE:  [Chinese].  

0:18 0:21 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  

0:23 0:25 MALE:  All right.  So what do you do at Stanford?  

0:26 0:33 FEMALE:  I, I, my major is educational management.  So I do testing.  

0:35 0:35 MALE:  Testing?  

0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  In education.  

0:37 0:37 MALE:  Nice.  

0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  How about you?  

0:40 0:41 MALE:  I'm in electrical engineering.  

0:41 0:44 FEMALE:  Oh really.  That's a cool --  

0:45 0:47 MALE:  Do you think so, I don't know, it's a major.  

0:47 0:55 FEMALE:  But you like -- Stanford is famous for engineering and I feel engineering students are very smart [laughter].  

0:56 1:02 MALE:  I think everybody here is smart, I mean we all just want to do different things.  So what is it that you want to do?  

1:04 1:35 FEMALE:  Well, I, I haven't thought about it.  Probably I will just teach, but I feel like because engineering, like my dad always wanted me to measure a map, but I feel like engineering people are so good at math, very, very fast in doing math problems and so, so I think, I think like engineering people are smart [laughter].  

1:36 1:45 MALE:  What do you like about education?  Because some of us are smart, I'm kind of smart I guess, I don't know.  What do you like about education, since that's what you do?  

1:48 1:48 FEMALE:  Education?  

1:49 1:49 MALE:  Uh-huh.  

1:50 1:57 FEMALE:  Because, because I did -- yeah I think I like, I like the teacher.  

1:58 1:58 MALE:  Oh yeah?  

1:58 2:01 FEMALE:  It's fun to be with like students [laughter].  

2:01 2:01 MALE:  I'm sorry?  

2:01 2:07 FEMALE:  I think it will be -- it makes me very happy to be with um like students.   

2:08 2:08 MALE:  Uh-huh.  

2:10 2:13 FEMALE:  And I feel that way I can be young forever.  

2:14 2:16 MALE:  Nice.  I bet that's true.  

2:17 2:18 FEMALE:  How do you like engineering?  

2:19 2:38 MALE:  Um, I enjoy it.  I think that it's a lot of fun if you have something fun to work on.  So if you have a good project, you can have a lot of fun being an engineer.  If your project is boring you're going to be bored, but that's probably like any job.  I think any job if you are doing education and --  

2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  That's true.  

2:40 2:47 MALE: -- if you have to do a curriculum you don't like, it's probably not fun either, but if you have a great curriculum and you have students and people you like working with it's probably a really good time.  

2:50 2:52 FEMALE:  So which part of the United States do you come from?  

2:52 2:54 MALE:  I'm from the East Coast, from Pennsylvania.  

2:54 2:55 FEMALE:  Oh.  

2:55 2:56 MALE:  Near Philadelphia.  

2:58 2:58 FEMALE:  So you're [unintelligible].  

2:59 3:00 MALE:  Yeah, how did you know?  

3:01 3:01 FEMALE:  I --

3:18 3:22 MALE:  Okay so you've been to my house.  I was going to put down that I hadn't met you, but you've been to my house before.  

3:23 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, well probably you don't remember, but I remember seeing you and -- oh how come you have so much time to do CA and you have do your work in engineering?  Because it takes [unintelligible]?  

3:44 3:46 MALE:  Just once every two weeks you have to do that.  

3:49 3:57 FEMALE:  Well, but I really feel like it's hard to do like a [unintelligible].
