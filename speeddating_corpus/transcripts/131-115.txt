0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  Really?  How long have you been here?  
0:33 0:33 MALE:  Two and a half years.  
0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  Two and a half years, and which department are you in?  
0:36 0:36 MALE:  I'm in physics.  
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Physics, okay.  
0:38 0:39 MALE:  Yeah, how about you?  
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  Are you from Madrid, or?  
0:40 0:44 MALE:  Yeah, Madrid, exactly.  It's funny you didn't say Barcelona, and you said Madrid.  
0:39 0:42 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, you know, that's where most people are, right?  
0:48 0:52 MALE:  Yeah, it's the largest city.  So, it seems to me you know Spain very much.  
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, I've gone there [unintelligible].  
0:53 0:54 MALE:  Oh really?  
0:49 0:51 FEMALE:  Actually, I [unintelligible] there before I came back.  
0:57 0:58 MALE:  You used to do [unintelligible]?  
0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  Do some business there.  
0:59 1:00 MALE:  Oh really?  Oh, what kind of business?  
0:56 1:07 FEMALE:  I used to do finance.  Like [unintelligible].  I worked for an investment company, and we would invest among European companies.  You know, like Telefonica.  
1:12 1:14 MALE:  Oh, yeah, you know all them.  
1:09 1:15 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  What's some other names?  
1:22 1:22 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].  
1:18 1:25 FEMALE:  Visatech [unintelligible] is a great company.  Yeah, I remember actually going up to [unintelligible], and that was just gorgeous. 
1:30 1:31 MALE:  Yeah, it's really nice.  
1:26 1:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's [unintelligible].  
1:34 1:36 MALE:  Oh, thank you.  So, what was your program?  
1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  My program here?  
1:37 1:37 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:33 1:36 FEMALE:  I'm in law school now.  I'm in the law and the business program.  
1:42 1:45 MALE: Yeah, that's what I thought.  I was pretty sure you would be in the business program.  
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  Yeah, had to bring up the whole finance thing.  
1:48 1:48 MALE:  Exactly.  
1:44 1:53 FEMALE:  Actually, you know, it's funny.  I came back because I actually wanted to do law.  So, actually I think after I graduate I want to be a practicing lawyer and not in finance anymore.  
1:59 2:01 MALE:  Well, you can use your business knowledge, right?  
1:56 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, I hope so.  That's the idea.  
2:05 2:08 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, that's a very good skill.  I mean there's so much business everywhere, you know.  
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:09 2:12 MALE:  So you are going to have plenty of choices I'm sure.  
2:07 2:11 FEMALE:  Now, are you here doing research or--
2:16 2:16 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, I'm doing research.  
2:12 2:13 FEMALE: In physics?  
2:18 2:19 MALE:  In physics, yeah.  
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  I actually know a guy in the physics department.  
2:20 2:21 MALE:  Oh really, what's his name?  
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  You know Wells?  
2:24 2:29 MALE:  I don't think so.  It's pretty big.  It's like 30 people per year.  
2:25 2:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, he's, uhm, I'll try to describe him.  Maybe you would know him.  He's like maybe a little bit taller than me, blonde hair, kind of [unintelligible], really nice.  
2:43 2:48 MALE:  I don't know.  Really, you know what happens that--after--what year is he?  
2:44 2:47 FEMALE:  He's in his--you know what he's [unintelligible] year.  
2:52 3:03 MALE:  Okay, so I'm not going to know him.  It's [unintelligible].  I don't meet third-year.  I know the third years, and the four years as well, but below that a few people.  
2:59 3:00 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:05 3:25 MALE:  I don't like [unintelligible] things, you know.  Everyone moves through the building, and you're so busy all the time.  You know, you--and you basically interact with the people you came at the same time with.  Yeah, so that's what we do.  So, you're from California.  Where in California?  
3:20 3:21 FEMALE:  I'm from San Jose.  
3:26 3:27 MALE:  Oh really.
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  Have you been down there  
3:28 3:33 MALE:  Actually, I had to go once to the IRS. [laughter]
3:28 3:35 FEMALE:  That [unintelligible] good.  The only reason why you would ever want to [unintelligible] go to the IRS.  
3:40 3:43 MALE:  I had to go.  That was a horrible experience.  
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  Do you have to pay taxes?  
3:47 4:01 MALE:  I do because I work here.  That's why.  But yeah I think it was in San Jose.  I know they have Flamenco dance there.  I should go.  Yeah.  I like [unintelligible] into it.  Nice to meet you.  
3:58 3:59 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
