00:00 00:02 FEMALE: It's a lot of information in a short time.  
00:02 00:03 MALE: Yeah.  
00:16 00:16 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  
00:02 00:03 MALE: Nice to meet you.  Hi.  Sorry.  male308.  
00:27 00:28 FEMALE: Take your time.  
00:05 00:09 MALE: You seem so familiar to me but--we must have been in, like, some other grad student event together.  What's your name?  
00:33 00:34 FEMALE: female330.  
00:11 00:11 MALE: female330.  
00:35 00:37 FEMALE: Where do you live?  Maybe you live in Rains [phonetic]?  
00:13 00:18 MALE: I live in Crothers [phonetic] but I'm over in Rains a lot visiting people.  We may have just, like, passed each there or something.  
00:42 00:44 FEMALE: Yeah.  I was a TA there, so that could be.  
00:20 00:22 MALE: Oh, that's sweet.  So what are you studying?  
00:47 00:54 FEMALE: Um, in a program called IPER, which will take four minutes if I--you said the name, nameX.  [laughter]  
00:29 00:30 MALE: Oh, fair.  
00:54 00:57 FEMALE: No, it stands for Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.  
00:34 00:35 MALE: Oh, very cool.  Wow.
00:58 01:02 FEMALE: So it's basically a Ph.D. where you can choose your own class and...
00:39 00:42 MALE: What's your area within environmental work?  
01:06 01:16 FEMALE: Um, I do social entrepreneurship, uh, studies.  I'm trying to make some [unintelligible] social entrepreneurship and water projects in developing countries because that's my [unintelligible].  
00:52 00:54 MALE: That sounds sweet.  Wow.  
01:18 01:18 FEMALE: How about you?  
00:55 00:57 MALE: Uh, second year law student.  Um--
01:21 01:26 FEMALE: Oh, that's where.  I go--we used to go to the law school library all the time.  
01:03 01:09 MALE: I think everybody else on campus finally figured out, because we get a lot of undergrads and our--the med school comes out in force.  
01:32 01:33 FEMALE: I know--you know why they go there?
01:10 01:12 MALE: It's wonderful.  Oh, why?  
01:36 01:50 FEMALE: So I have--my best friend goes to law school and it turns out that their books are really thick because they have huge binders and your seats are adjustable so I can actually, um, well, um, make the seat higher so I can actually read [unintelligible].  
01:26 01:26 MALE: [laughter] 
01:50 01:51 FEMALE: No, I'm serious.  
01:28 01:30 MALE: Those are the best chairs, though.  I mean, seriously.    
01:53 01:54 FEMALE: Yeah, it's true.  [unintelligible] 
01:30 01:35 MALE: It's a totally comfortable--I'll--I'll totally buy that.  You appreciate the--
01:57 02:10 FEMALE: You know the one thing I never actually understood is, like, they would peer at another law school student every time I go.  So, like, the guy in the reception that could come to me and say, did you know this is not for, like, nonlaw school students?  
01:47 01:47 MALE: Really?    
02:10 02:13 FEMALE: Yeah.  And he's, like, you have to leave if you're not, you know.  
01:50 02:06 MALE: Well, that's interesting because, you know, honestly, like, some crazy people within the law school would complain.  It's not like we're ever short of, like, like you said.  Um, and the librarian is saying, well, we don't want to be enforcers.  If it's a real problem let us know.  So I didn't realize--and do you leave then?  Don't leave.   
02:29 02:33 FEMALE: How do they even know?  Because I don't think law school students that have law school books.  
02:10 02:18 MALE: I--well, you know, it is a pretty small school, just like 170 people in class, which sounds big, but I guess you recognize everyone, you know.  How big is your program?  
02:43 02:46 FEMALE: Only six people per year, so.  No, we're a small family.  
02:23 02:24 MALE: What were you doing before?  
02:48 02:53 FEMALE: I was, um, doing my masters in Boston, where I did my undergrad too.  
02:30 02:31 MALE: Also in the same field?  
02:55 02:56 FEMALE: Uh, chemical engineering.  
02:34 02:34 MALE: Wow.  
02:57 02:57 FEMALE: I'm an engineer.  
02:35 02:40 MALE: How did you skip over into environmental, like, water, social entrepreneurship focus?    
03:03 03:19 FEMALE: That's a good question.  I, um, started to interview with typical oil companies, like Shell and Shell merger and things like that, and I have this, like, really interesting--basically it's an interview where they clearly were scouting for people with no environmental consciousness.  So--
02:57 02:58 MALE: Sounds about right, yeah.  
03:20 03:30 FEMALE: Yeah, and I do need a job so it's, like, the trouble is it's not a good fit for me.  [laughter].  And then I did some projects in Central America with rural villages.  
03:07 03:08 MALE: Oh, that's right.  
03:30 03:36 FEMALE: Um, water filters.  And I loved it.  So I wanted to be able to do that for, you know, my life.  
03:14 03:16 MALE: That's awesome.  How far into it are you?  
03:40 03:43 FEMALE: Um, the Ph.D. or?  
03:20 03:21 MALE: Yeah.  How many years have you been here?  
03:44 03:46 FEMALE: Two years.  So I'm going to be here for--
03:25 03:26 MALE: I never ask that question.  
03:49 03:50 FEMALE: I know.  That's a good thing.  
03:27 03:28 MALE: That's very bad form.  
03:50 04:02 FEMALE: That's a good thing.  And especially nice days where I'm trying to get my, like, proposal for my [unintelligible] don't ask, you know, what is your topic?  Because that's like the wrong question.  [laughter]
03:40 03:51 MALE: Well, I tread on my very thin ice earlier by trying to probe your area of focus.  But that's cool.  So I live in Crothers, you know, where--it's, um, like the law school--  
04:12 04:17 FEMALE: I know people that--do you know [unintelligible]?  He's like an Indian guy, [unintelligible].  
03:56 04:05 MALE: You know, it's funny.  It's about, like, 50% law school students and I know the law school students really well.  We're sort of tight.  I'm not so good at, you know, mixing with, um...  
04:28 04:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  
04:06 04:07 MALE: Anyway, it's really good to meet you.    
04:29 04:30 FEMALE: Yes, nice meeting you.  
04:09 04:10 MALE: Sorry.  
04:30 04:31 FEMALE: Yeah, have a nice day.  
04:09 04:10 MALE: You too.
