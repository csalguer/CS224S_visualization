0:00:01.5 0:00:02.3 FEMALE:  Hey.
0:00:02.9 0:00:03.5 MALE:  male106. 
0:00:02.7 0:00:03.5 FEMALE:  Sorry-
0:00:04.0 0:00:05.2 MALE:  [laughter] Okay.
0:00:03.4 0:00:05.8 FEMALE:  I just got to write your name.  I always spell it with two N's, I don't know why.
0:00:06.2 0:00:07.2 MALE:  [unintelligible] with a K? 
0:00:06.5 0:00:06.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:00:07.8 0:00:08.3 MALE:  Okay.
0:00:07.6 0:00:09.8 FEMALE:  I always think two N's.  I don't know why two N's. 
0:00:09.7 0:00:13.1 MALE:  Uh-huh.  I guess it's not the right pronunciation.  
0:00:12.4 0:00:12.9 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:00:13.6 0:00:15.3 MALE:  So are you having a good time tonight?  
0:00:15.0 0:00:15.9 FEMALE:  It's been amusing.
0:00:16.9 0:00:18.0 MALE:  Uh-huh. [laughter] 
0:00:17.2 0:00:20.9 FEMALE:  I think it's better than like doing homework on a Friday or a Thursday.  
0:00:20.3 0:00:25.7 MALE:  [laughter]  That- that's probably true.  Possibly more productive.
0:00:26.1 0:00:27.6 FEMALE:  Possibly.  [laughter] 
0:00:28.8 0:00:29.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:27.8 0:00:30.3 FEMALE:  I'm learning a lot more about like what people do here.
0:00:31.3 0:00:32.5 MALE:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
0:00:30.4 0:00:36.1 FEMALE:  'Cause I was like how come there's not any- any of these events here.  Like how come Stanford is just so isolated and there's like no--
0:00:36.5 0:00:37.0 MALE:  Yeah. 
0:00:37.1 0:00:39.0 FEMALE:  -you know big cross campus--
0:00:40.1 0:00:40.6 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:38.9 0:00:40.9 FEMALE:  -like grad things. 
0:00:40.8 0:00:42.2 MALE:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
0:00:41.0 0:00:48.0 FEMALE:  I don't know.  Like I wasn't a- I wasn't a grad student at Berkeley but I always felt like- that's why I like TPV because like you get [unintelligible] 
0:00:48.4 0:00:48.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:00:48.1 0:00:50.4 FEMALE:  -even like you're in my major, I never saw you-
0:00:50.5 0:00:51.5 MALE:  That's- yeah.
0:00:50.3 0:00:52.3 FEMALE:  -until I went to [unintelligible] 
0:00:52.2 0:00:53.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.  That's true.  
0:00:52.4 0:00:53.2 FEMALE:  It was cooler.
0:00:53.1 0:00:58.5 MALE:  And maybe it's different- it would be different here maybe in like the smaller majors.  Like we were saying. 
0:00:56.1 0:00:59.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  'Cause I know MIT did a lot of like more grad central-
0:01:01.0 0:01:01.5 MALE:  Really?  
0:00:59.6 0:01:01.3 FEMALE:  -things.  Yeah.
0:01:02.0 0:01:03.1 MALE:  I would imagine.  Yeah. 
0:01:02.6 0:01:06.2 FEMALE:  They spent a hundred thousand dollars on their orientation for grad students alone. 
0:01:07.0 0:01:07.6 MALE:  Serious.
0:01:06.9 0:01:09.1 FEMALE:  Because I went to their orientation because my best friend goes there.
0:01:09.7 0:01:10.1 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:08.9 0:01:12.3 FEMALE:  And I was like okay, Stanford doesn't start yet, let's just hang out at MIT for a while.
0:01:13.0 0:01:13.4 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:12.4 0:01:16.1 FEMALE:  Oh my God they like- they rented a boat. 
0:01:17.0 0:01:17.4 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:16.4 0:01:20.2 FEMALE:  And they put all the grad students on it and like loud music blaring, drinks and everything- 
0:01:20.5 0:01:21.5 MALE:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
0:01:20.1 0:01:22.9 FEMALE:  -and then did like other things.  Like they always have ski trips and like- 
0:01:23.8 0:01:24.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:23.3 0:01:26.1 FEMALE:  It's just a better community in general.
0:01:26.8 0:01:27.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:26.4 0:01:29.2 FEMALE:  Here it's just like you're on your own.  Get married if you want to.
0:01:28.8 0:01:33.0 MALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] [unintelligible]  
0:01:32.6 0:01:34.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So--
0:01:35.2 0:01:36.7 MALE:  Are you going to do that while you're here?
0:01:36.4 0:01:37.2 FEMALE:  Get married? 
0:01:37.4 0:01:39.3 MALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] 
0:01:37.8 0:01:41.8 FEMALE:  Um, I don't know see like for me the scary thing is if I- 
0:01:42.0 0:01:43.0 MALE:  I guess- yeah.
0:01:41.7 0:01:45.8 FEMALE:  -actually do then I'll never get out of California.  I'm not [unintelligible]  
0:01:45.7 0:01:46.6 MALE:  But do you want to?
0:01:45.7 0:01:47.3 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's my worst nightmare.  It's like- 
0:01:47.8 0:01:48.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:47.0 0:01:49.5 FEMALE:  I want to see the rest of the world before I lock myself down.  
0:01:50.2 0:01:50.6 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:49.4 0:01:53.3 FEMALE:  So I'm kind of like the rolling stone that gathers no moss.  I don't want to put down roots until-
0:01:54.1 0:01:54.5 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:53.6 0:01:55.0 FEMALE:  -I go out and--
0:01:55.4 0:01:55.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:54.7 0:01:55.6 FEMALE:  -see the rest of the world. 
0:01:56.7 0:01:59.7 MALE:  Well if you do a master's it's pretty quick.  But-
0:01:58.5 0:02:03.8 FEMALE:  Yeah, but it's kind of useless.  Because I mean it's like I always have a hard time finding engineering jobs on the east coast. 
0:02:04.7 0:02:05.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:04.5 0:02:06.9 FEMALE:  So I might have to go back to finance or banking.  So it's just like- 
0:02:08.2 0:02:08.6 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:07.6 0:02:09.8 FEMALE:  My master's degree won't be useful. 
0:02:11.2 0:02:15.7 MALE:  Well it still says something, you got a master's from Stanford.  It probably helps, uh-  
0:02:14.3 0:02:16.3 FEMALE:  But everyone gets a master's from Stanford.
0:02:17.2 0:02:17.9 MALE:  Everyone here.
0:02:17.3 0:02:20.4 FEMALE:  Everyone in engineering in the Silicon Valley EE.  [laughter]  
0:02:21.3 0:02:22.8 MALE:  I guess so too, yeah.
0:02:20.4 0:02:23.7 FEMALE:  It's like fifty percent if you can- and your company can pay-  
0:02:24.7 0:02:25.1 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:24.1 0:02:25.8 FEMALE:  -then you're gonna get a master's.  [laughter] 
0:02:26.4 0:02:27.5 MALE:  Yeah, uh-huh.
0:02:27.0 0:02:28.1 FEMALE:  So you're just average.
0:02:28.8 0:02:29.7 MALE:  That's a good point.
0:02:29.2 0:02:31.8 FEMALE:  Sorry, if you feel like you're special with your master's.
0:02:31.3 0:02:35.1 MALE:  Yeah.  I don't know.  [laughter] Yeah.  I don't know what to do now.  You just told me I'm average.
0:02:35.9 0:02:39.9 FEMALE:  Well at least you're not like- okay, you're status quo in the Silicon Valley.
0:02:40.1 0:02:42.2 MALE:  Yeah.  That's good.  It's not bad.
0:02:41.7 0:02:42.8 FEMALE:  You'll probably be a manager.
0:02:43.7 0:02:47.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.  So you like living at Raines?
0:02:47.9 0:02:49.4 FEMALE:  It's okay.  I haven't- I haven't been- 
0:02:48.8 0:02:50.8 MALE:  Have- have you been to a lot of the Raines parties?
0:02:50.4 0:02:53.1 FEMALE:  Not really.  I don't know anyone. [laughter] 
0:02:52.4 0:02:58.9 MALE:  [unintelligible] would have invited you if I had seen you.  [laughter] We had one like a few weeks ago.
0:02:58.3 0:02:58.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:59.3 0:03:02.2 MALE:  'Cause it was near my birthday and like a few other guys'.
0:03:01.7 0:03:06.7 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  So and you're like kind of- you're- you're in the archway, right?  You live in the archway or- 
0:03:07.3 0:03:08.8 MALE:  Um, in- in the archway, yeah.
0:03:08.3 0:03:08.7 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:09.0 0:03:10.8 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

0:03:11.6 0:03:14.0 MALE:  Yeah, up there in- in our place.
0:03:12.0 0:03:14.1 FEMALE:  Okay.  I know that-
0:03:14.1 0:03:17.2 MALE:  It was an interesting one 'cause like my- two of my roommates are French-
0:03:16.7 0:03:17.7 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.
0:03:17.7 0:03:24.5 MALE:  -so a very European style like the guy- guys were dancing on tables and stuff.  Like you wouldn't see that in- in a-
0:03:24.1 0:03:24.5 FEMALE:  Wow.
0:03:25.4 0:03:27.3 MALE:  -in an American party.
0:03:26.9 0:03:28.7 FEMALE:  [laughter] So awesome and like great for you.   
0:03:29.9 0:03:30.3 MALE:  Huh.
0:03:29.2 0:03:32.2 FEMALE:  Like watching your roommates go crazy.  [laughter]  
0:03:32.1 0:03:38.5 MALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] so I was kind of pretty drunk too, so I was not really able to appreciate it as much.  But-
0:03:37.5 0:03:39.5 FEMALE:  Okay, or disturbing, I don't know.
0:03:40.0 0:03:43.1 MALE:  Yeah.  So what do you do around here for fun then?

0:03:47.8 0:03:49.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I didn't study-
0:03:49.0 0:03:49.4 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:48.9 0:03:50.6 FEMALE:  -'cause I just wanted to see like-
0:03:50.5 0:03:51.0 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:50.4 0:03:51.3 FEMALE:  -what they were like.
0:03:51.8 0:03:52.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:52.2 0:03:54.9 FEMALE:  I was marginal.  Maybe I should have studied.  [laughter] 
0:03:54.7 0:03:54.9 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:54.8 0:03:55.5 FEMALE:  Oh well.
0:03:55.3 0:03:58.9 MALE:  Well the first year doesn't matter right.  You're not expected to.
