0:01 0:02 MALE: There's not enough time to do this. [laughter]
0:01 0:05 FEMALE: It isn't enough time.  How's it going. 
0:07 0:08 MALE: Good.  male311.
0:06 0:08 FEMALE: female334.  Nice to meet you. 
0:08 0:11 MALE: Nice to meet you.  So what are you, uh, studying here?
0:10 0:11 FEMALE: I'm studying Immunology. 
0:13 0:14 MALE: Oh, really?  Oh, wow. 
0:13 0:14 FEMALE: What about yourself?
0:15 0:17 MALE: I'm, um, I'm in electrical engineering. 
0:15 0:16 FEMALE: Double-E.  Yeah. 
0:18 0:25 MALE: Yeah, and so I actually did an MBA, and now I'm doing the EE.  So, uh, it's sort of a long, long--
0:18 0:19 FEMALE: Um hm. 
0:25 0:30 MALE: But in Immunology, you must--do you have to--do you have M--MD, or is that--or is that--or is that more of a--
0:28 0:30 FEMALE: Um, it's a PhD program. 
0:31 0:33 MALE: PhD?  Okay.  Okay. 
0:31 0:37 FEMALE: Actually, yeah.  Some of the M.D.s come over and do a joint program between us, us and the medical school.  But, um--
0:37 0:42 MALE: Okay.  Okay.  So is it part of the biology, or is it part of the medical school?
0:40 0:42 FEMALE: It's part of the medical school, actually. 
0:43 0:44 MALE: Okay.  Wow.  
0:43 0:44 FEMALE: It's a bit confusing, but--
0:46 0:48 MALE: How--so how did you get involved--like, interested in that?  I mean that's--
0:47 0:47 FEMALE: In Immunology?
0:49 0:49 MALE: Yeah. 
0:48 0:54 FEMALE: Well, um, let's see.  When I was in, uh, high school, I had a biology teacher who really got me interested in genetics. 
0:56 0:56 MALE: Okay. 
0:55 1:02 FEMALE: So I went to under grad, and I did a degree in genetics and a little bit of chemical engineering thrown in there, actually. 
1:03 1:03 MALE: Wow.
1:03 1:04 FEMALE: It's very, very different. 
1:06 1:06 MALE: Wow.
1:05 1:09 FEMALE: And then I kind of wanted to mix it up a little, and immunology's very interdisciplinary. 
1:08 1:11 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah, I can imagine.
1:10 1:13 FEMALE: Um, and it's a nice chance to work on diseases, too. 
1:14 1:15 MALE: Yeah.  
1:13 1:15 FEMALE: I got really interested in that. 
1:16 1:18 MALE: Yeah, my ex-girlfriend went into Immunology.
1:17 1:17 FEMALE: Oh, really?
1:19 1:29 MALE: Yeah, we went out at the end of, uh, under grad, and, and she moved off to Johns Hopkins, and I guess they have some sort of thing like that over there.
1:27 1:28 FEMALE: Yeah, they do. 
1:29 1:41 MALE: And so--and so then I never saw her again.  [laughter]  The short story.  But, uh, so, no, but, uh, no.  But she was like, like, obsessed with, you know, being in the lab, studying the [unintelligible].
1:40 1:44 FEMALE: Yeah, they--it tends to get overwhelming at times, but, I mean, [unintelligible]. 
1:44 1:46 MALE: Well, there's so much stuff you need to know.  
1:45 1:45 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:46 1:53 MALE: It's like a never-end--like you said, it's interdisciplinary, so you sort of have to know a little bit of everything or at least try to know a little bit of everything. 
1:52 2:03 FEMALE: It's hard.  You really have to maintain a life outside of the lab in order to, I guess, be concentrated when you're in the lab.  Because if you're, you're there all the time, and you kind of lose your focus. 
2:04 2:07 MALE: I can imagine.  You probably stay there 24/7.
2:06 2:13 FEMALE: Yeah, no, I don't.  Um, but, like, some of the people in the department do, and you really just see them, like, run around with their head cut off. 
2:15 2:33 MALE: Oh, my God.  Wow.  Well, that's--I mean, that--it sounds like that would be--I, I--it always sort of amazes me how people get into--you know, to me, that's sort of a specific field, for electrical engineering or a business degree is just sort of general.  I feel I never can make a decision about what I want to do. [laughter]
2:32 2:44 FEMALE: It, it, it's hard.  Like, even now, I mean, there's so much in Immunology that you could go, go and work on.  Plus, once you're done with your graduate degree, you could switch fields entirely to any of the other biology fields. 
2:44 2:45 MALE: Oh, really?
2:44 2:47 FEMALE: So it's, it's still very general.  It's hard. 
2:47 2:50 MALE: So what do you think you're going to be doing?  Or is it too early to say?
2:49 2:52 FEMALE: Uh, I think I'm going to be working on the immune system and how it develops. 
2:54 2:54 MALE: Okay. 
2:54 2:55 FEMALE: So how it--
2:55 2:58 MALE: Just, like, as a professor, or researcher, or--
2:57 2:57 FEMALE: Um--
2:59 3:00 MALE: Or in a, you know, lab somewhere or--
2:59 3:02 FEMALE: Like, a researcher, and then maybe go into consulting. 
3:03 3:04 MALE: Okay. 
3:03 3:06 FEMALE: And advise companies as to, like, what they should invest in. 
3:09 3:09 MALE: Okay.
3:07 3:14 FEMALE: And, um, yeah, like what sorts of products they should, uh, encourage the development of.  That kind of thing. 
3:14 3:16 MALE: That's a very difficult thing. 
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:17 3:27 MALE: Just because, you know, [unintelligible], like, the one-year thing, and oh, yeah, it's done.  It's a product.  It's, like, a ten-year program, which, you know, you have to go through all the trials and stuff like that. 
3:25 3:29 FEMALE: Yeah, it is.  The clinical trials get to be a big--a big, um--
3:30 3:45 MALE: Yeah. I think it's probably, I just--during when I was in my BA [unintelligible] thought that anything that had to do with biology or medicine in terms of investing was the riskiest thing ever because it's, like, you're throwing, you know, a football down the middle.  You don't know where it's gonna end up. 
3:45 3:47 FEMALE: It's, like, the .com boom of these days. 
3:47 3:48 MALE: Yeah. 
3:47 3:50 FEMALE: Everybody's like, "Oh, let's invest in a biotech company."
3:51 3:51 MALE: Exactly.
3:50 3:53 FEMALE: It's like biotech is the new [unintelligible] key word. 
3:53 3:57 MALE: Yeah. Yeah, or, like--yeah, so.  Whoa. 
3:56 3:56 FEMALE: All right. 
3:58 3:59 MALE: All right.  Well, it's nice meeting you.
3:58 3:59 FEMALE: It was nice to meet you.
