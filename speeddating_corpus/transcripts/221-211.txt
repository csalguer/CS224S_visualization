0:01 0:02 MALE:  I'm still male211.

0:00 0:03 FEMALE: I'm still female221.  Nice to meet you again.  [laughter].

0:05 0:06 MALE: Nice to meet you, again.  [laughter].

0:06 0:07 FEMALE: So what department are you in?

0:09 0:10 MALE: Uh, the Business School.

0:08 0:09 FEMALE: That's right.  Is it -- and it's a PhD program?

0:13 0:16 MALE: It is a PhD program.

0:12 0:13 FEMALE: What year are you?

0:17 0:19 MALE: Fourth year.

0:15 0:16 FEMALE: How's it going?

0:20 0:24 MALE: Yeah, hopefully will be done by next year.

0:20 0:21 FEMALE: And then what do you want to do?

0:25 0:27 MALE: Get into academia.

0:23 0:23 FEMALE: Teaching?

0:27 0:31 MALE: Teaching, yeah, but with fingers crossed.  It's quite complicated [phonetic] about the -

0:27 0:31 FEMALE: Really?  Just teaching in a business school, a PhD program kind of thing?

0:35 0:38 MALE: Mm-hmm.  Uh, no, you teach MBAs, actually.

0:34 0:35 FEMALE: MBAs, okay.

0:39 0:46 MALE: But it's interesting, in the Business School, the PhD is also above at the -- you know, in the background, the core is the MBA.

0:42 0:42 FEMALE: Uh-huh. 

0:46 0:56 MALE: So you don't -- the faculty doesn't even teach us that much, we have like two classes by them a year.  So it really amounts to classes outside, and actually with the classes I'm doing outside, I'm actually getting a Master's in Statistics now.

0:52 0:52 FEMALE: Huh.

0:56 1:02 MALE: But not putting in any extra effort.  Actually, I want to, so...

0:58 0:58 FEMALE: Right.

1:02 1:05 MALE: Okay.  You're first-year Slavistic -- Slavic.

1:01 1:01 FEMALE: Slavic.

1:05 1:06 MALE: So, uh, that's great.

1:02 1:17 FEMALE: Yeah.  Slavic languages, yeah.  Russian literature, basically.  I mean, our department calls itself -- they all call themselves Slavic languages and literatures.  Other departments in other schools, like, actually are Slavic, meaning they offer, like, programs in Polish and Czech or whatever, and our's is just Russian, so...

1:21 1:24 MALE: So you speak Russian?

1:20 1:20 FEMALE: Yeah, not nearly as well -

1:24 1:27 MALE: You understand it, also?

1:23 1:23 FEMALE: Yes.

1:27 1:28 MALE: I'm just kidding.  [laughter].

1:24 1:42 FEMALE: I mean, I don't -- I have -- I took five years off after undergrad, so it's been awhile since I've studied it, so I definitely need work on it, but I'll probably take some time after my Master's thesis is done, and maybe take a year off and go to Russia and study, and whatever.

1:46 1:48 MALE: So right now you're doing your Master's and -  

1:44 1:47 FEMALE: Yeah, it's a -- it's a combined program, so the first two years -

1:51 1:54 MALE: Oh, so you could take it -- the first two years are the Master's and...

1:50 2:07 FEMALE: Yeah, I mean, it's not exactly cut and dry like that, but, uh, you know, you take two years of classes, and then you have to do a Master's thesis.  So it's kind of whenever you get the Master's thesis done, you are done with your Master's and then in the meantime you're teaching and doing other coursework and working on your dissertation, and blah, blah, blah.

2:11 2:18 MALE: I learned the Russian script as a kid, 'cause like my parents were in Russia three years before I was born.

2:14 2:14 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:18 2:20 MALE:  And my father is fluent in Russian.

2:16 2:17 FEMALE: What was he doing there?

2:21 2:23 MALE: So he was in the defense forces.  

2:19 2:20 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:24 2:31 MALE: Like India and Russia, and what's been going on and, like he keeps going there to Russia every six months and they keep coming, so...

2:27 2:27 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:31 2:36 MALE: I used to have all these books and it annoyed the hell out of me that I couldn't read it.

2:32 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:36 2:38 MALE: And this one day, I said, "Okay, I'm going to learn this script."

2:34 2:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  Do you still remember?

2:40 2:41 MALE: Yeah, yeah.

2:37 2:37 FEMALE: Yeah?

2:41 2:44 MALE: I'm good with scripts, I know quite a few, actually.

2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  Mm-hmm.

2:44 2:47 MALE: I know like the Arabic script, the Hebrew script.

2:43 2:46 FEMALE: Arabic.  I tried to learn some of that once, and it's -- that was tough.

2:50 2:58 MALE: Actually, I know more of the Persian script, because like Pakistan, they have this language, Urdu, which is similar to our national language -

2:54 2:54 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:58 3:02 MALE:  - in spoken, but in written it's completely -- it's more like Croatian.

2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Huh.

3:02 3:04 MALE: Which is quite similar to Arabic.

3:00 3:00 FEMALE: Right.

3:04 3:11 MALE: So I learned their language, which, it's easy to read Persian.  Arabic, I still have difficulty, and especially since I don't know what it means.

3:07 3:07 FEMALE: Right, yeah.

3:11 3:16 MALE: Because I don't -- the only language I -- the only language I've learned, am learning is German now.

3:12 3:15 FEMALE: Right, right, and not just the script but the -

3:19 3:20 MALE: The script is the same.

3:16 3:17 FEMALE: - the spoken and the grammar, right, yeah.

3:21 3:24 MALE: They just have those dots on top, the eyes on top, you know?

3:20 3:21 FEMALE: Yeah.  How do you like the German classes?

3:25 3:32 MALE: It's great.  Like as I said, I was in Germany - I love the sound of German.  I love watching German movies.  Unfortunately, there aren't so many good ones.

3:28 3:28 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

3:32 3:35 MALE: But, yeah.

3:31 3:32 FEMALE: What else do you do for fun?

3:36 3:40 MALE: For fun -- I have fun for fun.  [laughter].

3:36 3:37 FEMALE: [laughter].

3:41 3:43 MALE: Just whatever it -

3:39 3:40 FEMALE: Whatever it is?

3:44 3:52 MALE: Yeah.  Um -- I like watching movies, I like going out with my friends, going over to the city, hanging out.

3:48 3:51 FEMALE: That sounds about right.

3:55 3:56 MALE: Hanging out at the beach, or something.

3:52 3:54 FEMALE: I haven't been to the beach yet, since I've been here.

4:00 4:01 MALE: Oh.

3:55 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah, I don't have a car, so I'm kind of, you know.

4:04 4:05 MALE: You need a car.

3:59 3:59 FEMALE: Yeah.

4:05 4:07 MALE: I didn't have a car my first year here, and it was horrible.

4:01 4:01 [Background Noise]

4:03 4:08 FEMALE: It's been okay, but I'm sure it will be better with a car.  Nice to see you again.

4:10 4:11 MALE: Nice to see you again.

4:09 4:09 FEMALE: Bye.

4:12 4:13 MALE:  See you.
