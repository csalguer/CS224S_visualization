0:43 0:45 MALE:  So, you must be somewhere from Eastern Europe, right?  
0:42 0:47 FEMALE: Why, because I'm getting the Russian, or because you hear some Slavic accent?

1:18 1:20 MALE:  Maybe economic sociology.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE: About what?  
1:23 1:31 MALE:  Yeah, well I haven't decided yet.  There are lots of topics [unintelligible].  So, I'm still thinking about it just now.  So, what year are you in?  
1:28 1:29 FEMALE:  Second year now. 
1:33 1:37 MALE:  Second year, right, right, right.  Okay, and--
1:33 1:39 FEMALE:  How do you like it?  So you've been here for--this is your--you just came in the Fall, right?  
1:43 1:45 MALE:  Yeah, in September, yeah, so half a year.  
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  Do you like it here?  
1:46 2:09 MALE:  Very much.  Yeah, I have enjoyed it, yes.  It's very good.  It's-yeah, yeah, yes.  I enjoy it a lot.  It's changing all the time.  It has changed a lot since I was a kid, you know, [unintelligible] and it still keeps changing.  So, I went there in July a year ago, and that was surprising.  It just keeps changing all the time.  
2:05 2:06 FEMALE:  The living or?  
2:10 2:18 MALE:  Yeah, the living standard, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The economy is growing pretty, pretty fast so [unintelligible].  
2:14 2:18 FEMALE:  Well, where am I from?  
2:22 2:25 MALE:  Sorry.  I haven't--I haven't cracked it yet.  
2:21 2:26 FEMALE:  Do you still think Eastern European still?  
2:30 2:32 MALE:  Probably, yeah.  Is that correct?  
2:29 2:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:34 2:43 MALE:  Okay, let me think.  You know, I can't tell.  It's all, you know--
2:39 2:39 FEMALE: [interposing]  [unintelligible].  
2:44 2:47 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Hungary, no?  Hungary?  
2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  Okay, I'm from Romania.  
2:51 2:53 MALE:  Right, [unintelligible].  Okay, pretty close.  
2:50 2:50 FEMALE: Yes.  
2:55 2:57 MALE:  Right, [unintelligible].  
2:54 2:56 FEMALE:  So you are doing better than Romanians do you think?  
3:00 3:02 MALE: I don't know.  
2:57 2:59 FEMALE:  That is much better?  
3:02 3:02 MALE:  I don't know.  
2:59 3:00 FEMALE:  I thought there is doing worse.  
3:05 3:08 MALE:  Well, I think it depends on what you are looking at, right?  
3:05 3:09 FEMALE:  Like overall, like the average standard of living.  
3:13 3:16 MALE:  I don't know.  I don't know.  
3:12 3:16 FEMALE:  Oh, I just saw a Ukranian movie.  
3:21 3:22 MALE:  Right, okay.  
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  I really like this.  
3:23 3:23 MALE:  Okay.  
3:20 3:29 FEMALE:  There was a mob thing in a Soviet country much more--we don't have it in the other Eastern European countries.  
3:32 3:32 MALE:  Right.  
3:29 3:31 FEMALE:  Or in [unintelligible].
3:36 3:56 MALE:  I guess it's true, but I mean you probably don't have as much mob as the U.S. has, or Japan, or many other countries.  So, I mean it all depends on what you are looking for.  Politically unstable, but probably Romania is much more stable.  But economical I think it is the reverse, so--
3:53 4:00 FEMALE:  [interposing] [unintelligible] the poor, the really poor.  
4:04 4:05 MALE: Yeah.  Nice meeting you.  
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
