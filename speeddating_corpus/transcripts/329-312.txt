0:00:31.8 0:00:35.4 FEMALE:  Good.  All of a sudden, what was it that I was supposed to say was going up?  Was it your courteousness?
0:00:38.0 0:00:38.7 MALE:  I'm- 
0:00:36.0 0:00:38.8 FEMALE:   What was I supposed to give him a one on and you a ten one?  I forget.  
0:00:40.2 0:00:42.1 MALE:  I don't know.  Was he not very courteous?

0:00:43.0 0:00:48.9 FEMALE:  Yeah, so what you told me to put as- on him?  You told me to put that he was one on something and you ten on- 
0:00:50.1 0:00:51.3 MALE:   Attractive probably.
0:00:49.1 0:00:53.3 FEMALE:  One on attractive and you ten on courteous?  I might have to do that.
0:00:55.1 0:00:56.7 MALE:  I don't know how about- how I feel about that.
0:00:54.9 0:00:55.9 FEMALE:  Well, what did you want then?
0:00:57.9 0:00:59.3 MALE:  What is this going- what is this?
0:00:57.6 0:00:59.0 FEMALE:  Um, it's an electrical outlet.
0:01:01.2 0:01:04.9 MALE:  Thanks for the update.  I mean, it looks like a- a hazard to me though.
0:01:00.4 0:01:06.2 FEMALE:  [laughter]  No, you can plug in there.  Plugging is good.  
0:01:06.6 0:01:07.1 MALE:  What is this?
0:01:06.7 0:01:10.7 FEMALE:  Um, this is a hair tie also known as a bracelet.  Would you like some?
0:01:12.6 0:01:14.7 MALE:  Sure.  It matches your- your uh- your shirt.
0:01:13.0 0:01:13.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
0:01:15.4 0:01:16.5 MALE:  What brings you here tonight?
0:01:15.3 0:01:18.1 FEMALE:  Um, nameX has to come so I came with her.
0:01:19.6 0:01:21.9 MALE:  Oh, you're not up in here to meet interesting people?
0:01:20.1 0:01:22.1 FEMALE:  Um, no.
0:01:23.0 0:01:24.8 MALE:  She's not interested in meeting interesting people.
0:01:23.4 0:01:25.8 FEMALE:  In fact, I assumed that everyone here would be terribly boring.
0:01:27.6 0:01:28.1 MALE:  Really?
0:01:26.1 0:01:29.9 FEMALE:  And so I did- thought that I would propose four minutes of pure silence with each one of them.
0:01:31.3 0:01:35.0 MALE:  Have you- have you- have they met expectations or exceeded expectations in terms of- 
0:01:32.6 0:01:34.1 FEMALE:   They have exceeded.
0:01:35.6 0:01:37.1 MALE:  -boredom.  Really- 
0:01:34.8 0:01:39.3 FEMALE:   Oh, in sort of boredom.  Oh yeah, they definitely exceeded highly.  I mean, I get boreder by the second.
0:01:41.4 0:01:45.7 MALE:  What's your honest- what's your honest hit rate?  You probably met fourteen guys.
0:01:43.1 0:01:43.7 FEMALE:  Here?
0:01:45.4 0:01:47.5 MALE:  How many would you want to go out with so far?
0:01:45.4 0:01:47.2 FEMALE:  Well okay.  Here, you want my honest opinion?
0:01:48.9 0:01:49.6 MALE:  Yeah, I do.
0:01:47.8 0:01:51.6 FEMALE:  My opinion is I don't think I'd actually date any of them, but there are some of them that I would love to hang out with.
0:01:54.3 0:01:54.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:52.8 0:01:56.9 FEMALE:  I don't know what you do about that because like when you're giving me your email for a date, I don't know.  I give them my email to hang out.
0:01:59.4 0:02:00.3 MALE:  Just say you want to hang out.
0:01:59.9 0:02:00.6 FEMALE:  On the sheet?
0:02:02.7 0:02:03.4 MALE:  No, I mean- 
0:02:01.7 0:02:02.3 FEMALE:   I'll go tell them that.
0:02:03.8 0:02:04.8 MALE:  -exchange an email with them.
0:02:02.2 0:02:07.5 FEMALE:  I'll be like hey- yeah, I know.  I think I will.  So that's- that's kind of how I take it.  So it's been fun.  How about you?  Hit rates?
0:02:09.7 0:02:18.9 MALE:  Um, yeah, I mean, I would say similar.  I mean, it's hard to know like when you meet someone for like four minutes, be it two minutes of a silence or two minutes of chatter.
0:02:12.6 0:02:17.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:19.1 0:02:23.4 MALE:  But then I may not want to date them, but you got to give people a chance too, right?
0:02:19.5 0:02:19.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:23.7 0:02:24.3 MALE:  You know?
0:02:23.2 0:02:23.7 FEMALE:  No I think it's- 
0:02:25.1 0:02:30.7 MALE:   But I do think you can tell sort of like could I see myself being with this person, you know.
0:02:29.3 0:02:29.9 FEMALE:  Go hang out with them.
0:02:31.4 0:02:34.4 MALE:  Or would I just punt it and say like no way?
0:02:33.6 0:02:34.2 FEMALE:  And be like I hate you.
0:02:35.9 0:02:37.4 MALE:  I'm out.  Peace out, late.
0:02:34.8 0:02:38.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, you suck.  [laughter].
0:02:39.0 0:02:41.3 MALE:  Uh, what are you studying?
0:02:40.0 0:02:40.6 FEMALE:  Product design.
0:02:42.5 0:02:43.0 MALE:  What?
0:02:41.4 0:02:42.3 FEMALE:  Product design.
0:02:44.1 0:02:46.2 MALE:  Oh, in the engineering school or- 
0:02:44.3 0:02:44.7 FEMALE:   Uh-huh.
0:02:46.8 0:02:47.9 MALE:  What do you want to design?  Like- 
0:02:46.5 0:02:47.9 FEMALE:   I'm currently doing skirts.
0:02:49.9 0:02:50.6 MALE:  Me, too.
0:02:49.5 0:02:50.1 FEMALE:  What?
0:02:51.6 0:02:52.0 MALE:  Me, too.
0:02:51.4 0:02:51.8 FEMALE:  You too?
0:02:53.3 0:02:56.6 MALE:  Me- I was kidding.  Just kidding.  Just kidding. 
0:02:54.7 0:02:56.0 FEMALE:  [laughter] That why I was like- 
0:02:57.3 0:02:58.8 MALE:   I just wear them.  I don't really design them.
0:02:56.5 0:03:02.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Okay.  I was going to say that is the weirdest thing I've ever heard. [laughter] 
0:03:03.2 0:03:06.4 MALE:  What that I'm a guy who designs- this is the Bay area.  You got to free your mind.
0:03:03.9 0:03:08.3 FEMALE:  Actually, that's true although then I would say you should be on this side of the- with me.
0:03:09.4 0:03:15.8 MALE:  Hey, not a- let's not enforce gender roles here.  You're- you're designing- 
0:03:13.2 0:03:15.9 FEMALE:   Well, if you want to meet the right kinds of people, I mean- 
0:03:16.8 0:03:18.3 MALE:   Right.  So you're designing skirts?
0:03:15.8 0:03:17.9 FEMALE:  -you can be on this side.  Yeah, I am.
0:03:19.6 0:03:20.1 MALE:  Nice.
