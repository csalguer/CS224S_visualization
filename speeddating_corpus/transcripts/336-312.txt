0:00:51.6 0:00:52.8 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:00:51.1 0:00:54.3 MALE:  And I- I have a history major, so, uh, I- 
0:00:54.1 0:00:56.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Good for you.
0:00:55.4 0:00:57.0 MALE:  You have a long road, you know.
0:00:56.3 0:00:58.3 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:00:56.8 0:00:58.5 MALE:  What- what do you want to specialize in?
0:00:59.8 0:01:03.9 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I- I did some stints at the emergency department I really liked it.
0:01:02.3 0:01:03.0 MALE:  At the what department?
0:01:04.0 0:01:05.3 FEMALE:  Emergency medicine maybe.
0:01:03.9 0:01:04.5 MALE:  Oh, wow.
0:01:05.6 0:01:10.5 FEMALE:  Or pulmonary medicine because I like the lung a lot.  Or oncology just because I've always wanted to do that.
0:01:07.6 0:01:10.2 MALE:  So, you- you like the lung, you're just- 
0:01:11.0 0:01:11.9 FEMALE:  So, I don't know.
0:01:10.6 0:01:11.6 MALE:  You're interested in the lung?
0:01:12.3 0:01:18.3 FEMALE:  Well, I don't know what you [unintelligible] like good about it.  Like we breathe so effortlessly and we don't think about it.
0:01:16.2 0:01:17.8 MALE:  Yeah.  Right.
0:01:18.7 0:01:21.3 FEMALE:  And it just- I'm a geek I guess in that sense.
0:01:20.0 0:01:23.2 MALE:  [laughter] Yeah, that's okay.  So, I mean, ER is pretty intense though.
0:01:22.3 0:01:29.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess.  I've never seen- you know the funny thing though, I've never seen an episode of ER.
0:01:28.4 0:01:29.8 MALE:  No, I mean, the ER.
0:01:30.8 0:01:31.9 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  I know.
0:01:30.5 0:01:32.6 MALE:  Like you said you wanted to go into maybe ER medicine.
0:01:33.6 0:01:34.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:32.7 0:01:37.9 MALE:  Is that just 'cause you like sort of dealing with time sensitive issues or, you know?
0:01:38.7 0:01:41.2 FEMALE:  I think I want to be able to help pretty rapidly.
0:01:40.3 0:01:40.7 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:41.3 0:01:45.8 FEMALE:  I like instant gratification and I don't want to deal with someone's obesity problems so much like- 
0:01:44.9 0:01:45.4 MALE:  Yeah.
0:01:46.1 0:01:55.1 FEMALE:  -I just feel like all my training- I don't know.  I'd be really frustrated with that.  And then you can schedule your times, you get to take a month off, climb a mountain, come back, whatever.
0:01:52.4 0:01:57.1 MALE:  Oh you can?  So, that's pretty good sort of work life balance?
0:01:58.0 0:01:59.0 FEMALE:  Kind of yeah.
0:01:57.4 0:01:58.5 MALE:  You like to climb mountains?
0:01:59.9 0:02:02.0 FEMALE:  Um, sometimes, yeah.
0:02:00.4 0:02:01.2 MALE:  Sometimes.
0:02:02.0 0:02:03.3 FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:02:01.5 0:02:03.8 MALE:  Is that kind of- is that kind of like your outdoor thing you're into?
0:02:04.9 0:02:07.3 FEMALE:  Yeah, I like to do outdoor stuff.  How about you?
0:02:06.7 0:02:20.4 MALE:  Uh, I- I'm- I'm a cyclist, yeah.  I'm really into outdoor type stuff.  Um, which is one of the reasons I like it out here.  I grew up in Upstate New York, so not as many, um, mountain ranges out there. [laughter] 
0:02:21.4 0:02:21.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:20.4 0:02:36.8 MALE:  Or weather, um, that's conducive to that.  But I've been out here for five years and totally, you know, I've been won over to sort of year around nice weather.  I mean, it's hard to find a day out here where you can't go for a run outside or go do something.  Uh, where are you from originally?
0:02:34.2 0:02:38.7 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Tennessee.
0:02:39.5 0:02:41.3 MALE:  So- well, that's not bad weather either.
0:02:43.3 0:02:45.7 FEMALE:  Are you kidding me?  [laughter] No, it's- it's- 
0:02:44.4 0:02:47.6 MALE:  Compared to here I'm from, I mean, we used to get one hundred forty inches of snow a year.
0:02:48.2 0:02:52.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Did you do undergrad here then or-
0:02:51.0 0:02:53.5 MALE:  No.  I- I did undergrad at Princeton so.
0:02:54.2 0:02:55.6 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  So did I.
0:02:54.0 0:02:55.8 MALE:  So, my- my- oh you did?  Really?
0:02:56.3 0:02:56.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:56.1 0:02:57.4 MALE:  Oh, cool.  What year were you?
0:02:58.1 0:02:58.6 FEMALE:  '99.
0:02:58.4 0:02:59.6 MALE:  I was 2000.
0:03:00.6 0:03:01.0 FEMALE:  Wow.
0:03:00.2 0:03:03.1 MALE:  Yeah, I- yeah I liked it.  I like it out here better, I think.  
0:03:04.3 0:03:05.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Me too.
0:03:03.7 0:03:11.8 MALE:  Um, it's kind of like, you know, I grew up in Upstate New York and so I went to Princeton in Upstate, which is kind of- you know, I had enough of the East Coast I think kind of.
0:03:12.3 0:03:12.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:13.1 0:03:19.3 MALE:  Um, so- well, it's good out here.  I'm going back for my fifth, uh, in three weeks, two weeks.
0:03:20.2 0:03:20.9 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah? 
0:03:19.8 0:03:22.8 MALE:   Yeah.  I- I mean, I have not been back for a single reunion.
0:03:22.8 0:03:24.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:03:23.3 0:03:30.6 MALE:  And I wasn't going to go back since it's our last, um, weekend of this school, but a bunch of people were like look you only have one fifth.
0:03:31.8 0:03:32.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:31.3 0:03:33.6 MALE:  Go back.  Did you go to your fifth?  No?
0:03:35.4 0:03:36.8 FEMALE:  I think people I want to see, I'll see.
0:03:35.7 0:03:40.6 MALE:  Yeah.  That's kind of how I felt, but I guess I got- I got talked into it.
0:03:41.6 0:03:42.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:41.4 0:03:43.5 MALE:  So- so- I mean- 
0:03:44.5 0:03:51.2 FEMALE:  I think I also had stuff too going on.  I mean, if I had- if I had- I think I had classes or finals or something going on so.
0:03:50.1 0:03:55.0 MALE:  So, like, if you were in business school where there's- it's really low key you- you would have gone?
0:03:54.1 0:03:58.6 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Yeah.  What did you do on your time out?
0:03:57.8 0:03:59.9 MALE:  Uh, I worked in finance at a hedge fund.
0:04:00.8 0:04:01.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:04:00.5 0:04:03.4 MALE:  And I'm actually looking to move out of that soon [unintelligible] 
0:04:02.6 0:04:03.3 [horn]
0:04:03.6 0:04:08.6 MALE:  -a little- a little more like directly involved with companies than [unintelligible] stocks and so.
0:04:09.1 0:04:09.5 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:04:09.0 0:04:08.8 MALE:  Well, it was good to meet you.
0:04:11.5 0:04:12.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, you too.
0:04:11.1 0:04:12.1 MALE:  Have a good rest of the night.
0:04:12.9 0:04:13.3 FEMALE:  You too.
