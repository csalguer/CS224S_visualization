@0:01 0:01 FEMALE: Hi. 
@0:01 0:02 MALE: How's it going?
@0:02 0:05 FEMALE: Good.  Why are we whispering?  [laughter]. Hi.
@0:05 0:05 MALE: I don't know.  
0:06 0:07 FEMALE: Yeah, everyone else is quiet.
0:00 0:01 MALE: No one else is talking.  
0:07 0:08 FEMALE: You're the other male307.  Okay. 
0:02 0:03 MALE: Uh, no I'm the male307.
0:10 0:15 FEMALE: You are the male307.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't have a name where I need to use an initial, so--
0:09 0:11 MALE: Ah.  [unintelligible]. 
0:18 0:21 FEMALE: female335.  Yeah.  You were right. 
0:19 0:19 MALE: How's it going?
0:27 0:28 FEMALE: Good.  Are you having fun?
0:21 0:22 MALE: Yeah. 
0:29 0:30 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:23 0:27 MALE: It's funny.  It's, like, a funny day.  You're just, like, talking, and then it's like, "Okay.  Stop talking.  Move on." 
0:34 0:38 FEMALE: The air horn is really unhelpful.  [laughter] It's kind of [unintelligible]. 
0:30 0:33 MALE: It's very, sort of, like, "I guess I'll just stop mid-conversation."
0:41 0:44 FEMALE: I know.  I think every time it sounds, I exclaim.  Like, "Oh, my.  What is this noise?"
0:37 0:39 MALE: Yeah.  So what are you doing at Stanford?
0:46 0:51 FEMALE: I'm doing my PhD in Biology, and I was an under grad here, too. 
0:44 0:47 MALE: Oh, wow.  You just couldn't get enough of [unintelligible]-- 
0:52 0:58 FEMALE: I'm trying to find ways to stick around.  Yeah, well, I can get enough of [unintelligible], but the weather is--
0:51 0:52 MALE: Are you living down here, then?
1:00 1:01 FEMALE: Yeah. I just live on campus. 
0:54 0:56 MALE: So straight through?
1:03 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:58 0:59 MALE: How long is it now?
1:06 1:09 FEMALE: Um, so seven years since I came. 
1:02 1:03 MALE: Seven years. 
1:10 1:13 FEMALE: I was class of '02, and now I'm in my third year of my PhD. 
1:06 1:07 MALE: Wow. 
1:14 1:15 FEMALE: Yeah. It's a tough place to leave. 
1:08 1:09 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
1:16 1:18 FEMALE: [unintelligible]. 
1:13 1:15 MALE: I have so much to learn from you.  You've been here seven years. 
1:23 1:27 FEMALE: I know all the hot spots.  There are, like, five.  If I could show you them. 
1:20 1:21 MALE: Yeah, it's unfortunately true. 
1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:22 1:23 MALE: Do you go to the city much, or [unintelligible]--
1:30 1:37 FEMALE: I do.  Yeah, these days a lot more than before.  Um, but now I have [unintelligible] more friends who've migrated up there, so I gotta--
1:30 1:31 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
1:39 1:44 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  It's--parking is really kind of prohibitively an issue sometimes. 
1:37 1:39 MALE: I can be so nervous [unintelligible]. 
1:46 1:48 FEMALE: Yeah.  Do you live up there?
1:41 1:44 MALE: I don't.  Actually, I live in [unintelligible]. 
1:51 1:51 FEMALE: Okay. 
1:44 1:47 MALE: And I'm, uh, living up there.  And it's so much fun. 
1:54 1:55 FEMALE: Which part were you in?
1:48 2:03 MALE: I was down in Marina [phonetic].  I was working in Mill Valley, so I was trying to [unintelligible] every day, which is so--I went from, like, 45-minute New York subway ride to, like, 15-minute, you know, cruising over the Golden Gate with the sun shining.  It's definitely a good move. 
2:11 2:11 FEMALE: That's nice. 
2:05 2:09 MALE: It's a nice city to be in [unintelligible] years now. 
2:15 2:17 FEMALE: You probably miss cities in general.
2:10 2:21 MALE: Yeah.  No, that's true.  Although, it's kind of funny.  I was totally planning to go up to the city next year, but now I'm going to end up staying around here for yet another year. 
2:28 2:28 FEMALE: Um hm.
2:22 2:26 MALE: I guess like you, I'm kind of--I'm kind of stuck in the Stanford area [unintelligible]. 
2:33 2:37 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's kind of convenient.  That's the thing for me. 
2:30 2:37 MALE: It's definitely easy.  It's pretty and it's nice.  It's like a little bubble world where it's all separate from reality. 
2:44 2:45 FEMALE: Right, right. 
2:38 2:39 MALE: What are you studying in Biology?
2:46 2:50 FEMALE: Um, I study population genetics, which is, um--
2:42 2:43 MALE: Interesting.
2:51 3:03 FEMALE: Yeah, I think so. It's, uh--it's using math, computer science and statistics.  I was a math major in college, to model genetics.  Um, so I study human evolution, which is always a nice catch phrase. 
2:57 2:57 MALE: Evolution?
3:04 3:05 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:58 3:01 MALE: So are we evolving?  How are we doing on that?
3:08 3:12 FEMALE: Yeah, we are, kind of.  We've eliminated a lot of selection pressures, slowly. 
3:06 3:08 MALE: Because life's comfortable now?
3:15 3:40 FEMALE: Yeah, we're very--I think we're very much in control of what's happening to our genes.  Yeah.  But actually, what I study is, like, the junk of the genome that doesn't get turned into anything.  Um, because you can have some nice properties that you can use to study other things, like disease genes.  But it's maintained really well from parent to offspring because they're useless.  So one big question is, "Why is it even there?" which a lot of people want to know. 
3:33 3:34 MALE: Yeah.  So why's it there?
3:42 3:49 FEMALE: I don't know, but it looks like the rate at which we're losing DNA because we're losing DNA over time. 
3:42 3:42 MALE: Really?
3:49 4:02 FEMALE: The human genome is getting smaller.  The rate at which we're losing DNA is similar to other mammals that have very large genomes as well. So a party fact for you is that the largest genome--
3:55 3:55 MALE: A party fact?
4:03 4:07 FEMALE: The largest genome known to man is in a single-cell paramecium.
4:00 4:01 MALE: Really?
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: It's got, like, this huge genome. 
4:02 4:03 MALE: I would've never guessed that. 
4:10 4:11 FEMALE: There you go.  [laughter]. 
4:04 4:06 MALE: That's it.  Thanks for the party fact. 
4:13 4:16 FEMALE: Sure.  I'd be concerned about the kind of parties you go to if you could use it. 
4:10 4:11 MALE: Yeah. 
4:18 4:20 FEMALE: It you came to the parties I go to, maybe. [laughter] 
4:18 4:24 MALE: The ones where they, like, [unintelligible] people [unintelligible]?
4:31 4:35 FEMALE: You can use dry ice to eat the drinks.  You know, when you work in a lab, there's a lot of fun stuff to play with.
