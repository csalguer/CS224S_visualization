0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  For awhile in the States, I was thinking like staying two or three years and after moving back to Europe, not to Spain, but to Europe. 

0:36 0:37 MALE:  Right. 

0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  What about you? 

0:38 0:38 MALE:  Well I lived in Sweden before, so I've lived overseas.  Yeah. 

0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  Sweden, okay. 

0:42 0:42 MALE:  I lived there for a year and I've also, like I lived like a summer in a couple other places, but I don't really know where I want to live.  I kind of like California right now just because it's got great weather and a lot of just natural resources. 

0:54 0:57 FEMALE:  What year are you in the engineering?  You are PhD? 

1:00 1:00 MALE:  Fourth.  Is that it? 

1:01 1:01 FEMALE:  I don't know. 

1:02 1:02 MALE:  I thought we had four minutes? 

1:03 1:05 FEMALE:  So what?  What's that?  

1:05 1:10 MALE:  I don't know what that meant.  I guess we're still allowed to talk. 

1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  Okay. 

1:16 1:17 MALE:  Do you still want to talk to me? 

1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  Sure.  So you are in a fourth year of a PhD?  That's a [unintelligible] it's a Masters.

1:31 1:32 MALE:  Hi female234.  

1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Hi male213. 

1:33 1:34 MALE:  But anyway, cool, so -- 

1:37 1:38 FEMALE:  What does that mean four year because I don't understand this graduate programs that [unintelligible] it means that you are doing a PhD or a Masters or what's that? 

1:43 1:44 MALE:  I'm doing a PhD. 

1:44 1:45 FEMALE:  And -- 

1:45 1:45 MALE:  You can do whatever you want. 

1:46 1:46 FEMALE:  Okay. 

1:46 1:47 MALE:  You can do PhD or Masters. 

1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Okay fourth year of a PhD. 

1:49 1:50 MALE:  Uh-huh. 

1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  And how many years do you have? 

1:51 1:52 MALE:  It goes about -- I have another year and a half. 

1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Okay, well you're lucky, that's good. 

1:56 1:56 MALE:  Am I? 

1:56 1:56 FEMALE:  At least another year in California yes? 

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Yeah.  Law school is only three years. 

1:59 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, but I'm doing a Masters so it's only one year program. 

2:02 2:03 MALE:  Oh really? 

2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  It's really short for mine.  The Masters to [unintelligible] three or four years to know in California. 

2:11 2:12 MALE:  Yeah.  You'd like it to last three or four years. 

2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  Yeah. 

2:15 2:15 MALE:  What do you like to do in California? 

2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  Hiking.  I like going to the mountains and the beach and -- 

2:21 2:22 MALE:  The weather is getting really nice for it now. 

2:23 2:24 FEMALE:  I'm planning a trip with my friends for next month.  So I'm preparing that. 

2:29 2:29 MALE:  Where are you guys going? 

2:30 2:31 FEMALE:  Yosemite [unintelligible] and Grand Canyon. 

2:35 2:37 MALE:  The Grand Canyon is awesome. 

2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Yes? 

2:38 2:38 MALE:  Yeah I was there spring break last year and it was just an amazing time.  Are you going to take time to go down in the canyon or are you just going to get to the canyon? 

2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  No we want to stay three or four days, we're thinking -- we don't know if to go with a helicopter or where we could go rafting on the Colorado River.  What's more nice? 

2:56 2:57 MALE:  I don't know.  We just -- we hiked down into the canyon one day and then across another day and then up another day. 

3:01 3:03 FEMALE:  Okay. 

3:03 3:03 MALE:  So, you'll probably -- I'm sure that if you do one of those things I'm sure you'll see a lot either way. 

3:09 3:32 FEMALE:  Okay because it's so expensive to go in the helicopter and with rafting, it's like $300 each or something like this.  So we're thinking, I don't know -- see the Grand Canyon on the air or on the river, so we have to decide on that.  I have to check on the internet, what sounds more interesting.  It's like as a foreigner we want to try everything because we don't know, I don't know when I'm going to be back to this country so I'm like -- 

3:32 3:32 MALE:  So you said you were in a one year Masters? 

3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  Yes. 

3:34 3:34 MALE:  So you're in that -- so you just have this year to do everything you want to do in California right? 

3:38 3:38 FEMALE:  No, I'm staying longer. 

3:39 3:39 MALE:  Okay. 

3:39 3:40 FEMALE:  I'm staying at least until January next year.  So I think I have all this summer and -- 

3:45 3:47 MALE:  Do everything you need to do, you like hiking, what else do you like to do? 

3:52 3:53 FEMALE:  My main probably is hiking, but that's what I really like.  I also love going to the beach and enjoy the sea, I like the sea, but we have in Spain called the Mediterranean. 

4:02 4:03 MALE:  Yeah you like the beach, but then you came to the States in Northern California and you realized that the beach just wasn't what you want it to be. 

4:08 4:11 FEMALE:  So I'm trying to get more adventurous [unintelligible] because the mountains here are so impressive, the Redwood Forest and -- 

4:16 4:18 MALE:  The Redwood Forest. 

4:18 4:19 FEMALE:  This is very special. 

4:21 4:22 MALE:  Have you been to [unintelligible] up there, up north?

4:24 4:25 FEMALE:  No. 

4:25 4:26 MALE:  It's a redwood forest, it's redwoods or sequoias I'm not sure, but it's got big trees and it's very beautiful. 

4:33 4:34 FEMALE:  What's that a sequoias or redwoods? 

4:34 4:35 MALE:  I don't know.  I think one of them is one kind of the other, but I'm not sure.  No I do like hiking, but I just don't know about redwoods. 

4:42 4:43 FEMALE:  What are your hobbies, what do you do in your free time? 

4:44 4:46 MALE:  Right, well my hobbies kind of change because I'm really busy in school and you can't do any one thing like all the time.  But I like hiking too, I've hiked my last two spring breaks and I used to play a ton of music, but I don't really have so much time for that. 

5:01 5:01 FEMALE:  What do you play? 

5:01 5:02 MALE:  Cello. 

5:02 5:02 FEMALE:  Oh that's nice. 

5:03 5:08 MALE:  I'm taking an improv class right now. 

5:10 5:10 FEMALE:  What's that? 

5:11 5:11 MALE:  Like improv -- 

5:11 5:12 FEMALE:  Improvisation, okay.  [UNINTELLIGIBLE] 

5:13 5:15 MALE:  Where's the next station do you know? 

5:16 5:18 FEMALE:  No idea.  I suppose you follow the -- 

5:19 5:21 MALE:  Where do we go? 

5:21 5:25 FEMALE:  That way.  You move there.  Okay.  I should -- we should -- okay, good to know.
