N/A MALE: Unless you get the last [unintelligible]
0:02 0:03 FEMALE: Right.  [laughter]  Well.  
0:00 0:01 MALE: So we can start?  
0:08 0:08 FEMALE: I don't know, what are we-- 
0:04 0:04 MALE: Are we allowed-- ?  
0:11 0:12 FEMALE: I have no idea.  
0:12 0:13 FEMALE2: We haven't started time yet.  
0:13 0:13 FEMALE: Okay, good.
0:14 0:14 FEMALE2: Get back to your seats.
0:19 0:20 FEMALE: [unintelligible]  Nice.  
0:16 0:17 MALE: Right, doesn't matter, where are you from and uh-- ?
0:25 0:29 FEMALE: So my uh home town is Sisak, it's close to Zagreb. You probably--
0:22 0:22 MALE: Zagreb, yes.
0:29 0:36 FEMALE: Zagreb is the capital city.  There's no way, I mean, my home town is like 50 hund-- 50,000 people maybe, so, it's very small.
0:29 0:29 MALE: Okay.
0:36 0:37 FEMALE: So, you would not know about it.
0:31 0:35 MALE: Not familiar with the-- I'm not familiar with the Yugoslavian geography or Croatian.
0:43 0:49 FEMALE: Yeah, that's perfectly okay, I-- you know, I wouldn't know about it, probably, if I was not from there, so, it's okay.  
0:42 0:43 MALE: How long have you been in the U.S.?
0:51 0:51 FEMALE: Six years.
0:45 0:45 MALE: Six years, oh.  
0:52 0:52 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:47 0:48 MALE: Well, what are you doing in here?
0:56 1:00 FEMALE: Started my undergrad here and then I'm doing my M.D./Ph.D., medicine and neuroscience.
0:53 0:53 MALE: Oh, okay.  
1:01 1:02 FEMALE: So I'll be here for a while.  
0:55 0:57 MALE: So you do the two M.D. and Ph.D.?
1:04 1:05 FEMALE: Yeah, both.
0:59 1:01 MALE: They I mean, is there- is there an interest?  I mean--
1:08 1:08 FEMALE: I'm sorry.
1:01 1:06 MALE: I notice in the system, with a M.D., with a M.D., you can like become a surgeon.
1:14 1:31 FEMALE: So with an M.D., I could be like any kind of medical doctor, and with a Ph.D. it's just like whatever you do a Ph.D. in.  When you do both, theoretically you're supposed to be a doctor researcher, so kind of do research but kind of have medical knowledge and kind of skew research in the sense that is, you know, medically relevant.  That's the idea.
1:24 1:27 MALE: So is- so is not Ph.-- it involve the Ph.D.?  Can you-- ?
1:33 1:36 FEMALE: Yeah, you could do research, you could do research without it, [horn] but-- 
1:29 1:31 MALE: But without an M.D., you cannot uh-- 
1:38 1:40 FEMALE: Exactly, you can't do medicine, yeah exactly.
1:33 1:35 MALE: So it's better to have a the M.D., and then if you're still uh--
1:43 1:44 FEMALE: Right, there's--
1:37 1:39 MALE: --if you still like studying, you can do a Ph.D.
1:46 1:51 FEMALE: Yeah, exactly.  Although the way it's usually done here is that you do your first years of med school, then you do your Ph.D., and then last year's are med school.
1:45 1:45 MALE: Oh, okay.
1:52 1:57 FEMALE: And so it's kind of broken, but it kind of makes sense.  How about with you?  What do you study, and-- ?
1:50 1:52 MALE: No, I am um, I'm in postdoc here.
1:59 1:59 FEMALE: Okay.
1:52 1:53 MALE: In uh solar physics.
2:01 2:01 FEMALE: Okay, wow.
1:55 1:55 MALE: So.
2:02 2:03 FEMALE: Cool, that's awesome.
1:56 1:59 MALE: I pretended I'm regular student, to come here.
2:05 2:07 FEMALE: Uh-huh, that's so cool.  Wow.
2:00 2:03 MALE: Wh- what is your, the topic of your Ph.D.?
2:10 2:28 FEMALE: Well, I'm barely, like, I'm not, haven't really started doing much research, because I just was doing M.D. part so far, but it will be, so it's cellular moledular neuroscience, and it's basically developmental neuroscience, so how neurons as they develop, how they find their appropriate synaptic partners.  It's kind of like neuronal dating, if you want, you know like--
2:21 2:21 MALE: [laughter]
2:28 2:36 FEMALE: No, it is, I mean, like, you know, you're going along, you know, and like there's that neuron right there, and that one there, and that one there, and how do you know who to wire up with?  
2:29 2:43 MALE: But- but is like, it's, um, it's okay, and I'm going to sound stupid, but is like embryology like the evolution of the uh, of the neurons, where you are born in.  Because once you, once you are born in it, your neurons are connected?
2:50 2:51 FEMALE: Right, right, right, that's it.
2:44 2:45 MALE: They don't move, right?
2:51 2:52 FEMALE: Right, right, right.
2:45 2:47 MALE: So it's- it's connected to embryology, it's embryology?
2:54 3:11 FEMALE: So yeah, it's, yeah, it's still developmental, developmental biology and neuroscience, and cellular, so basically-- I mean, theoretically I could be in the developmental biology program, but I mean like it's one of those things where like the topic is neuroscience, but it's really molecular and developmental, so I, it kind of falls under multiple-- 
3:03 3:04 MALE: So it's- it's a mixed uh--
3:11 3:11 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
3:05 3:08 MALE: Wow, that's interesting, so you can, you can know uh, two different uh--
3:15 3:25 FEMALE: Yeah, it's nice, and like, you know, I know like, you know, I mean, I'll be doing a lot of genetics and a lot of molecular biology, in terms of technique, so it's- it's nice.  I'm excited, it's really fun.  You know.
3:18 3:19 MALE: And then, what do you plan to do?  You plan to stay?
3:27 3:36 FEMALE: I'll stay in the United States.  Uh, well I mean, my parents are here now, and my sister is here, my brother is there, so there's really like not that much to go back to right now.  
3:29 3:29 MALE: Yeah.
3:36 3:40 FEMALE: And, one of the kind of things that I would like to do like, you know, United States, would probably be like top notch.  So--
3:33 3:34 MALE: Yeah, it's very interesting, [unintelligible]
3:41 3:44 FEMALE:--yeah.  How about yourself, are you going back?  Are you from France originallY?
3:37 3:38 MALE: I'm from France, yeah.
3:45 3:46 FEMALE: Yeah, I guessed, based--
3:39 3:42 MALE: Uh, I arrived two years ago, and uh--
3:48 3:48 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:41 3:44 MALE: And uh, I recently refused a position in France.
3:51 3:52 FEMALE: Wow.  Okay.  [laughter]
3:46 3:46 MALE: [laughter] So--
3:54 3:55 FEMALE: Does that mean you're staying?  [laughter]
3:49 3:53 MALE: That means, yeah, I plan to stay, and they are not- not, I better not get fired from my lab.  
4:00 4:01 FEMALE: [laughter] Right.
3:55 3:57 MALE: Otherwise, I can, I can like, I can't go back to France anyway.
4:04 4:05 FEMALE: Okay.  Wow.
3:58 3:58 MALE: So--
4:06 4:11 FEMALE: Could you, if you wanted to go back, would they still accept you, or is it now done deal, you never-- 
4:04 4:10 MALE: Well, the point is, in my field, there are like 200 people who work in this- in this, on this topic in France.
4:17 4:18 FEMALE: Okay, okay.
4:10 4:12 MALE: So, everyone knows each other.
4:19 4:19 FEMALE: Okay.
4:12 4:14 MALE: So, once you refuse a job--
4:21 4:21 FEMALE: Right.
4:14 4:16 MALE: I have to prepare to stay in the U.S. It's better.
4:23 4:25 FEMALE: Right.  Not good. [laughter]
4:19 4:19 MALE: Not good at all.
4:26 4:27 FEMALE: Okay.
4:20 4:21 MALE: People don't forget you, so--
4:28 4:29 FEMALE: Right.
4:22 4:25 MALE: But if I want to work for a company as an engineer or something like that.
4:32 4:34 FEMALE: Okay, you could, right.
4:25 4:29 MALE: I can go back to France, but if I want to do research, I'd better stay in the U.S.
4:36 4:39 FEMALE: Right, so why did you stay?  Just better opportunities, or-- ?
4:32 4:32 MALE: Stupid reasons.
4:40 4:40 FEMALE: [laughter]
4:33 4:34 MALE: The weather is better.
4:42 4:42 FEMALE: Okay.  
4:36 4:37 MALE: The campus is very nice.
4:45 4:46 FEMALE: I- I agree.
4:39 4:40 MALE: And the pay also is good.
4:48 4:48 FEMALE: Oh.
4:41 4:41 MALE: There is no comparison.
4:49 4:52 FEMALE: Really?  Okay.  And like are expenses also higher?  I mean, like--
4:45 4:50 MALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, better- uh, cost of living is much more expensive in the U.S.
4:57 4:57 FEMALE: Right.
4:50 4:52 MALE: Or at least in the Bay Area, than in France.
4:59 4:59 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:53 4:55 MALE: But uh the pay is so much higher--
5:02 5:05 FEMALE: Okay, that's so- so it's better off in the end.  Uh-huh.
4:58 4:59 MALE: It's [unintelligible] difference.
5:06 5:06 FEMALE: Oh.
5:00 5:00 MALE: So.
5:08 5:09 FEMALE: Okay, that's impressive.  
5:02 5:04 MALE: I don't really like Paris.
5:11 5:12 FEMALE: Really?  Interesting.
5:05 5:07 MALE: To me, there's too much pollution and--
5:14 5:20 FEMALE: Right.  Maybe for living there, I mean like I- I visited once, so like I spent maybe four days there, I loved it, but it's a different perspective when you're a tourist.  
5:13 5:13 MALE: Yeah, exactly.
5:21 5:25 FEMALE: then you come and visit, and it's just like, you know, romantic, and the Eiffel Tower and what not.  
5:18 5:18 MALE: Yeah, exactly.
5:25 5:28 FEMALE: You know, like and I'm sure if you lived there from day-to-day basis, it may get old.
5:21 5:25 MALE: Yeah, when you just visit it's nice, but when you are stuck in the traffic jam every day.
5:32 5:32 FEMALE: [laughter]
5:26 5:28 MALE: And people yell at you, yell at you, and-- [horn]
5:35 5:35 FEMALE: Right.
5:28 5:30 MALE: And then Parisien are not very nice.  So.
5:37 5:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  Interesting.
5:31 5:33 MALE: Okay, it was short, but nice to meet you.
5:39 5:40 FEMALE: Okay, yeah, yeah, nice meeting you.
