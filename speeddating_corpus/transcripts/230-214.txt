0:01 0:02 MALE: Wow that's fast.

0:01 0:06 FEMALE: Yeah they, they're cheating us.  They, they minus 10 seconds off every time--

0:06 0:07 MALE: Oh is that right?

0:06 0:07 FEMALE: --so we're actually doing this in three seconds.

0:07 0:10 MALE: All right.  So you are female230.

0:08 0:10 FEMALE: female230.  Nice to meet you.  male214?

0:11 0:12 MALE: Is that short for anything?

0:11 0:13 FEMALE: Yeah, it is.  female230.  female230's my real name.

0:14 0:16 MALE: Oh really?  Okay.  That's a pretty name.

0:14 0:18 FEMALE: Yeah but no one calls me female230, so [laughter] except my mother when she wants to kill me.

0:19 0:20 MALE: Oh I see.

0:19 0:20 FEMALE: What do you do?

0:21 0:25 MALE: I do, well I'm finishing a degree in mechanical engineering.

0:24 0:25 FEMALE: Oh neat.

0:25 0:27 MALE: And then I'm starting another degree in aerospace.

0:26 0:28 FEMALE: Wow.  So you're probably doing--did you do a master's in--?

0:29 0:30 MALE: Two masters.

0:29 0:30 FEMALE: Oh two master's?

0:31 0:33 MALE: Yeah, so I'll be here for a total of four years.

0:33 0:35 FEMALE: Is it unusual for people to choose to do two master's degrees?

0:36 0:41 MALE: I don't know.  I think people usually do go for a PhD instead of two master's.

0:41 0:44 FEMALE: But it's awesome that your interests are so diverse that, I mean, aerospace--

0:45 0:46 MALE: My interests are very diverse.

0:45 0:46 FEMALE: That's awesome.

0:47 0:52 MALE: And I like to learn a lot about a lot of different things and go to the expert PhDs if I have a question, that's what--

0:50 0:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:52 0:53 MALE: I like talking to people and--

0:52 0:53 FEMALE: Yeah totally.

0:53 0:54 MALE: It's just a lot of fun.

0:54 0:58 FEMALE: Well, I'm MS and E, so there's nothing engineering about what I'm doing.  I was an econ major.

1:00 1:01 MALE: Oh okay.

0:58 1:09 FEMALE: And then I wanted to come to Stanford, because, you know, everyone tells me the Silicon Valley vibe, and entrepreneurial instinct is developed here, so I decided I'll come here, and MS and E seemed the logical choice.

1:10 1:12 MALE: MS and E is a great tool for engineers.

1:11 1:41 FEMALE: It sort of rounds out a little bit the engineering expertise that you already bring.  But, you know, I don't know, maybe I'm a little bit cynical.  I, I didn't know this at first, but now that I've taken more and more classes, I take quite a lot of classes in the GSB as well, I've taken, you know, strategy and all the good classes at MS and E, but I just--I just feel like a little business concepts are too--they, they don't engage me because they are not quite as concrete as the engineering.  I don't know if you--have you ever taken MS and E classes?  Not yet?

1:42 1:47 MALE: I, well, I took, I took one class--well, I was going to take one class, called optimization, introduction to optimization.

1:46 1:47 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:48 1:49 MALE: I think it's more of a--

1:48 1:49 FEMALE: That's more technical.

1:50 1:59 MALE: Right, and so, but the, the professor wasn't really good, so he, he didn't have good control over the classroom.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:00 2:02 MALE: And he wasn't--he wasn't really the best lecturer.

2:03 2:05 FEMALE: To say the least or [unintelligible].

2:06 2:15 MALE: So I um--he asked the people in the back row to move up and that's just not something you should do, 'cause then you have such a--there's so many people in the auditorium, so I just walked out.

2:15 2:16 FEMALE: Oh.

2:17 2:18 MALE: And everybody started laughing, 'cause--

2:17 2:18 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:19 2:20 MALE: So that was, that was, that was funny. 

2:20 2:23 FEMALE: I think some of my teachers are quite good, but the material doesn't quite--I don't know--

2:24 2:25 MALE: I understand.

2:24 2:26 FEMALE: --the body to it doesn't quite engage me.  

2:27 2:28 MALE: Sure.

2:26 2:28 FEMALE: But I'm heading back to work pretty soon.

2:29 2:30 MALE: Oh wow.

2:29 2:30 FEMALE: I'm more looking forward to that, I must say.  

2:31 2:32 MALE: Oh I see.

2:30 2:38 FEMALE: You know, you seem very keen on academics, but I am--I would say I'm ready to get out and start um being independent and [unintelligible].

2:39 2:42 MALE: No I was ready to get out and start doing stuff, but I wanted to stay in longer so I could have a better choice of jobs.

2:41 2:42 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:43 2:53 MALE: So initially I had some offers on satellites, but I don't--I don't want to work on satellites.  I'd rather work on space vehicles and rockets, so I decided to stay in for another two years.

2:52 2:53 FEMALE: Are you an American citizen by any chance?

2:54 2:56 MALE: I'm American, right.  It helps.  Are you an American citizen?

2:54 2:56 FEMALE: Yeah, okay, so.  You're of Indian, Indian descent, right?

2:57 2:58 MALE: Yeah.  You're right.  

2:57 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  One of my friends now because, you know, MS and E is flooded with Chinese like myself and Indians, it's like we rule the place, basically.  So a lot of my friends are Indian.

3:05 3:06 MALE: Okay.  

3:05 3:08 FEMALE: Yeah.  I went to do the--did you go to divali [phonetic] like, the celebration and--?

3:10 3:14 MALE: I don't know.  I don't remember, sorry.  I don't know

3:13 3:22 FEMALE: Last year.  Oh you missed a good show.  There was even this guy, one of my friends, [unintelligible] he put up--they put up a dance skit, a musical of uh, all the different Hindi--do you watch Hindi movies or--?

3:23 3:24 MALE: I used to.

3:23 3:31 FEMALE: You used to?  And so they, they put up a different decade of Hindi movies, they were like, acting Raj Kapoor and all these famous people.  It--and [unintelligible] so that was fun.

3:33 3:35 MALE: Wow, wow that's great.  Yeah, I wish I'd attended.

3:33 3:36 FEMALE: I'll probably go to India in December 2006.  One of my good friends here is--

3:37 3:38 MALE: Really?

3:36 3:37 FEMALE: --getting married.

3:39 3:40 MALE: Wow, that's exciting.

3:38 3:40 FEMALE: So I guess it's a whole, like, big Punjab wedding.

3:41 3:42 MALE: Yeah.  

3:42 3:43 FEMALE: You know, and like, for days on end, so--

3:43 3:44 MALE: Where are you originally from?

3:43 3:44 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore.  

3:44 3:45 MALE: Oh Singapore, okay.

3:44 3:45 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:45 3:46 MALE: That's nice.

3:45 3:46 FEMALE: Do you know anybody from Singapore?

3:47 3:49 MALE: Yeah.  I do.  I went to--

3:47 3:50 FEMALE: Yeah.  They flood this place too, so I wouldn't be surprised if uh--

3:51 3:57 MALE: I went to Yosemite over the weekend and I met, I think three people, between two and three people from Singapore.

3:56 3:57 FEMALE: Really.

3:57 3:58 MALE: I don't remember their names though.

3:57 4:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  I just went to Yosemite three weeks ago so [horn].

4:01 4:02 MALE: Really?

4:01 4:02 FEMALE: Yeah.  So it's a nice place.

4:03 4:04 MALE: Yeah it is, it is.

4:03 4:06 FEMALE: Last time I did the hike to, up to Yosemite Falls, with the zig-zags.

4:07 4:08 MALE: That's what I did too.

4:07 4:09 FEMALE: Oh my gosh I was so tired after [unintelligible].

4:10 4:11 MALE: Really.

4:10 4:11 FEMALE: But it was nice to meet you.

4:12 4:13 MALE: Yeah.  It was nice to meet you too.

4:12 4:13 FEMALE: Yeah.  Have to move on unfortunately.  [horn] 

4:13 4:14 MALE: Take care, female230.  [horn]
