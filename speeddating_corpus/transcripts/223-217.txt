1:15 1:20 FEMALE:  No, only very recently, maybe there have been a few, like, migrant workers that have come. 
1:21 1:21 MALE:  Uh huh. For agriculture?   
1:21 1:26 FEMALE:  But um, it's like really, like, no people have come in to--
1:27 1:27 MALE:  Really? 
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  --my little town, you know, like ever.  
1:29 1:29 MALE:  It's all white?   
1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  And there's no jobs.  It's just like--
1:31 1:31 MALE:  Are you serious? 
1:32 1:34 FEMALE:  --just, just, yeah, white people.  There's no black people, there's no Hispanic people, there's like--

1:38 1:40 FEMALE:  It really is, my hometown, it's really sad.  [laughter] 
1:41 1:41 MALE:  Really?  So there is no jobs? 
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  There's no jobs at all.  There's nothing. 
1:42 1:44 MALE:  What do people do there to survive? 
1:45 1:47 FEMALE:  Some people, um, they used to farm tobacco.
1:48 1:48 MALE:  Uh huh. 
1:48 1:51 FEMALE:  But then, now the government shut that down, so they're giving them money to not grow it.  
1:52 1:52 MALE:  Really? 
1:52 1:53 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:54 1:54 MALE:  I bet you think you want to go back. 
1:54 1:56 FEMALE:  And now, I think, I think they grow pot.  [laughter] I don't know what they do.
1:57 1:57 MALE:  Are you serious?  Like pot? 
1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, I think, I don't know. 
1:59 1:59 MALE:  [laughter] 
2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  That's probably--
2:01 2:02 MALE:  That's why you went to Berkeley to make contacts there. [laughter] 
2:03 2:04 FEMALE:  Um, and, and um--
2:05 2:05 MALE:  Are you serious? 
2:06 2:08 FEMALE:  --I think that um, a lot of people go work in industry, like six hours away in Ohio--
2:10 2:10 MALE:  Uh huh.  
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  --or somewhere and then go for like several weeks and then come back.  
2:14 2:14 MALE:  Oh really? 
2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, there's really no jobs.  No.  
2:16 2:16 MALE:  So there's no fields or can they have agriculture, like--
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, but there's no, there's no industry.  
2:20 2:20 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:21 2:26 FEMALE:  Like it's really small farms, like you know, each household has it's own, so they don't make very much money.  So--
2:27 2:27 MALE:  Do you know like everybody in town? 
2:28 2:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.
