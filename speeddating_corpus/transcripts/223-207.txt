0:03 0:03 MALE:  Are you having fun so far? 
0:04 0:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm like how many more people are there?  
0:07 0:08 MALE:  It's kind of a blur, huh? 
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  It seems like there's a lot, yeah. 
0:09 0:18 MALE:  Kind of a blur.   I was stuck with nameX over on the other side of your wall, and we're saying like we get to at least move, so it's like a different backdrop in addition to a different person, but you're kind of like, different face, same background, right? 
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Little weird, yeah.  But I guess that's--they had to figure out some way to set it up, seems like.  
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:25 0:27 FEMALE:  I guess we get to be lazy, us girls.  
0:28 0:29 MALE:  That's true.  
0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  [laughter] Where are you from? 
0:30 0:31 MALE:  I'm from Virginia, near D.C. 
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Okay, I'm from Kentucky.  
0:34 0:34 MALE:  Oh yeah? 
0:34 0:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:35 0:37 MALE:  So you like it, you like the California thing?  
0:38 0:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, California's nice, laid back, lots of beautiful nature, people are just cool and weather's nice.  Yeah.  
0:45 0:46 MALE:  There you go, what else could you ask for? 
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  Yeah really.  Everybody that I've talked to says the same thing--
0:49 0:49 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:50 0:52 FEMALE:  --California, it's really nice. 
0:53 0:53 MALE:  Do you think you'll go back eventually? 
0:54 0:57 FEMALE:  No, I'll never go back and live in Kentucky again.  I'm from like a town of 1,100 in the middle of absolute nowhere--
0:58 0:59 MALE:  Okay. 
1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  --and there wouldn't be a job there if I wanted one.  
1:02 1:02 MALE:  Okay. 
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  So no. 
1:04 1:04 MALE:  Are you also in education? 
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  No, I'm in linguistics.  
1:06 1:06 MALE:  Ooh.  
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:08 1:10 MALE:  So you should be able to guess where I was from just the way I talked huh? 
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  No we don't do that.  [laughter] 
1:12 1:13 MALE:  So are you friends with the person, nameX that's right through the wall? 
1:14 1:16 FEMALE:  Yeah she's my office mate, yeah.  So.  
1:17 1:17 MALE:  Okay, all right.  Oh that's right. 
1:17 1:17 FEMALE:  She, she was the one that told me to come tonight.  
1:18 1:21 MALE:  Oh she told me about that, how she just kidnapped you and um--. 
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  [laughter] She's like you'll see my friend on the other side.  
1:23 1:24 MALE:  There you go.  That's right. 
1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, what do you study? 
1:26 1:26 MALE:  Electrical engineering.  
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  Okay, you're like the millionth engineer in this--
1:29 1:31 MALE:  I mean let's be honest right, all the girls, most of the girls are in education. And the guys--
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Are they? 
1:33 1:33 MALE:  It seems like it.  
1:34 1:36 FEMALE:  Okay, I didn't know what the girls do. 
1:37 1:41 MALE:  So, it's kind of--I mean it's a problem right?  Engineering is like a lot of dudes. I mean--  
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  [laughter] Sounds like it.  
1:44 1:44 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:44 1:49 FEMALE:  I just found out that there are like 700 electrical engineers, or something, I'm like oh my God, there's like 30 linguistics grad students.  
1:50 1:56 MALE:  It's tough because like, in addition to feeling like a number according to the school, because you're just like just like another one that came in, yada, yada, yada.  
1:57 1:57 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:58 2:06 MALE:  It's also like, there's a little bit of like a stereotype I guess, right.  There's a stereotype in anything so it's kind of--but I don't think I would ever lie about it. 
2:07 2:07 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:08 2:08 MALE:  Just to avoid the stereotype.
2:09 2:12 FEMALE:  [laughter] It's like I study uh, art history. [laughter] 
2:13 2:13 MALE:  I feel like it might be better to like start with low--
2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:15 2:15 MALE:  --expectations, and then like actually-- 
2:16 2:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, get somebody that doesn't care if you're an electrical engineer and then get them to like you on top of that.  [laughter] 
2:20 2:21 MALE:  So. 
2:22 2:30 FEMALE:  Ah don't worry about it.  Girls, girls aren't' like that. Like most girls probably are just like, you're like engineer, and be like oh he's going to make big bucks.  [laughter] 
2:31 2:31 MALE:  [laughter] Yeah.  
2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  So I mean, like, hey.  [laughter] 
2:32 2:33 MALE:  [laughter] 
2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  I don't know. 
2:35 2:35 MALE:  Awesome.  
2:36 2:41 FEMALE:  I just imagine like, I know  a lot of, the girls like, I don't know, you see when you go out into the bars and stuff, it seems to be what they're interested in.
2:42 2:43 MALE:  I think it'd be around this area right, it's not like a valley or something. 
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:45 2:46 MALE:  So there's a lot of--certainly during the [unintelligible].   
2:47 2:48 FEMALE:  What company are you moving up in?  
2:48 2:49 MALE:  Exactly, exactly.  
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:51 3:01 MALE:  Which is, no, there are times when I wish I was done that whole route of like the moving up in the company thing, but like, I don't know, problem is I'm not really that hard a worker, I mean I work hard--
3:02 3:08 FEMALE:  I don't, I don't believe in the value of hard work as it's own, like, you know, thing.  It's not important, it's a means to an end, whatever. 
3:09 3:13 MALE:  So I like having kind of other things going on, you know, I play a lot of pick up basketball. 
3:14 3:14 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:14 3:34 MALE:  Like this quarter I was in--well so this year, I'm doing this thing called SPOT Stanford Pre-Orientation Trips, which is, they're starting a uh, outdoor program for incoming freshman and transfers.  So I've been a coordinator for that, and that takes a lot of hours, so it takes a lot of time from like, my research, but its like, if I do one thing all the time, then I start kind of feeling like I'm crazy.  
3:35 3:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:35 3:37 MALE:  So like having kind of a couple things that I'm focused on. 
3:38 3:47 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I think they, here when you get into grad school, it's like they expect you to do that one thing so intensely, they don't make room for like doing exercise or like anything, reading books for your own--
3:48 3:48 MALE:  Right. 
3:48 3:51 FEMALE:  --pleasure or anything that like distracts you from your core goal.  But that just drives you nuts.  
3:52 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.  It's true.  
           [horn]
3:54 3:56 FEMALE:  They're driving people out, I think.  [laughter] 
3:57 3:57 MALE:  Gee.  You've been getting it like that all day, huh?  
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:59 3:59 MALE:  It was better on the other side of the wall.  
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  I'm right next to it. 
4:02 4:02 MALE:  Cool.  Good to meet you. 
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
4:04 4:04 MALE:  Sorry it wasn't longer.  But you know how these things are.  
4:05 4:05 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
4:06 4:06 MALE:  Is this my water?  Probably not.  
4:07 4:10 FEMALE:  I don't know.  [laughter]
