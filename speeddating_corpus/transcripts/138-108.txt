0:00:37.8 0:00:43.4 FEMALE:  I really don't know.  I came here to do like optics, so I don't know like device level, systems level, circuits level.  I have no idea.  
0:00:38.2 0:00:39.0 MALE:  Oh.
0:00:43.1 0:00:43.7 FEMALE:  Like the whole-  
0:00:39.7 0:00:40.5 MALE:  Yeah, it's- it- 
0:00:44.3 0:00:49.2 FEMALE:  -the whole span I don't know.  Like this place is crawling with optics from like chemistry to-
0:00:44.1 0:00:44.8 MALE:  Right.
0:00:48.9 0:00:51.6 FEMALE:  -biology, so technically I can go anywhere, right.
0:00:46.8 0:00:47.4 MALE:  Right.
0:00:51.9 0:00:53.1 FEMALE:  But I don't know.

0:01:22.8 0:01:23.4 FEMALE:  Like I- 
0:01:18.3 0:01:23.3 MALE:  You- yeah, usually that happens.  Like there are so many engineering students you know that and so- 
0:01:27.7 0:01:28.3 FEMALE:  Yeah, so like-
0:01:23.5 0:01:24.7 MALE:  -they- they group together and- 
0:01:29.0 0:01:35.6 FEMALE:  They don't- but there's no big events here on campus to open it up to everyone.  Because like I know at MIT every one is open to everything and they have like [unintelligible] 
0:01:30.2 0:01:32.9 MALE:  Oh you are from MIT?  [laughter]  
0:01:35.9 0:01:41.1 FEMALE:  I am not from MIT, but I went there- went through most of their orientation because I lo- all of my best friends go there.

0:02:09.4 0:02:12.4 MALE:  I- I- I don't, so I don't go there.  But that's okay.
0:02:16.3 0:02:16.9 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:12.5 0:02:19.4 MALE:  But there is- there is a nice, uh, Indian culture festival where at least you can mix with the Indian people.  That's called devali but- 
0:02:24.4 0:02:24.9 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:19.6 0:02:27.9 MALE:  Yeah, otherwise like, uh, [unintelligible] what we don't have- nobody has time.  Like if you're taking the same classes then you meet for doing the assignment or something or something but-  
0:02:31.5 0:02:32.2 FEMALE:  Homework and-
0:02:28.0 0:02:28.7 MALE:  Otherwise- 
0:02:33.4 0:02:40.5 FEMALE:  But I mean like, okay, yeah, [unintelligible] because I was imagined- like I had figured, you know, [unintelligible] around the nation because I was from Berkeley.  
0:02:35.8 0:02:36.4 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:40.9 0:02:41.4 FEMALE:  So like--
0:02:36.3 0:02:39.8 MALE:  Oh there, there is lots of socializing and [unintelligible] 
0:02:43.7 0:02:50.3 FEMALE:  There is- like the groups are really big.  Like three professors and like lots of grad students and they're all- like they stay in a cubicle area, so there's thirty of them.
0:02:45.6 0:02:46.1 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:50.5 0:02:56.4 FEMALE:  And they eat lunch together.  They party together.  They drink together.  They eat steak.  And I was like eating steak with them and playing on their softball team. 
0:02:51.6 0:02:52.1 MALE:  Okay. 
0:02:56.6 0:02:58.6 FEMALE:  So like it was like a party up there.
0:02:53.9 0:02:54.5 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:59.0 0:03:02.0 FEMALE:  But down here there's like not that-
0:02:56.5 0:02:57.6 MALE:  Well it [unintelligible] 
0:03:01.9 0:03:10.8 FEMALE:  I think that-- I don't know, for me I feel like I haven't found the things, but like are there softball teams or like [unintelligible] I- I don't know, like I just feel like-
0:03:05.6 0:03:06.0 MALE:  Well-
0:03:10.9 0:03:13.6 FEMALE:  -I don't know enough to say that it's not- 
0:03:08.5 0:03:10.9 MALE:  Yeah, if it's not there or something like that.  Yeah.
0:03:15.2 0:03:15.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:10.8 0:03:17.4 MALE:  Well so like you were doing your undergrad in Berkeley right?  So undergrad is definitely different than graduate.
0:03:21.4 0:03:26.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But I was hanging out with grad students, like playing softball.  I was on the grad student softball team [unintelligible] 
0:03:21.4 0:03:22.2 MALE:  Oh.
0:03:26.2 0:03:32.9 FEMALE:  -grad students like eating steak and like- so I just thought like that was like a normal cool thing.  And I liked all my grad student TAs. 
0:03:28.2 0:03:28.7 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:32.7 0:03:35.8 FEMALE:  And that's what they did in a short time.  And I was like, I want to be just like that.
0:03:31.4 0:03:35.9 MALE:  Well there- there's a- they have lots of groups like [unintelligible]

0:03:48.3 0:03:49.6 FEMALE:  Okay.  So you've done those?
0:03:44.8 0:03:47.2 MALE:  No, I have not done that.  I know friends who have done that. 
0:03:52.1 0:03:53.4 FEMALE:  You're too busy.  [laughter] 
0:03:48.3 0:03:53.7 MALE:  Yeah, because like it's- it's too hard to get- like actually get some time out of the quarter.  Maybe like go to [unintelligible] 
0:03:58.0 0:04:00.2 FEMALE:  When you're a TA and you're researching so that's probably- 
0:03:54.9 0:03:57.0 MALE:  Right.  And, uh-
0:04:00.1 0:04:02.9 FEMALE:  I- don't do both right now.

0:04:08.0 0:04:11.8 MALE:   But Raines- Raines is a more better place to socialize.  That's what people have told me.
