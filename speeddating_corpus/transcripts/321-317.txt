0:00:21.0  0:00:05.6  FEMALE:  Well, as a high school student I did cross country and I hated when you're bending down waiting with like 50 other people for that to happen.

0:00:13.6  0:00:19.0  MALE:  Okay.
0:00:42.7  0:01:07.5  FEMALE:  I'm Masters student in Social Sciences and Education.  And my Masters thesis or extended paper--it's not really a thesis, those things could kill you--um is um looking at women of color who applied to graduate school.  And the game that, what kind of, I interviewed people um, who have experience as admissions uh board members--
0:00:43.8  0:00:43.9  MALE:  Really. 
0:01:07.6  0:01:25.1  FEMALE:  --in the key power circle at a given [unintelligible]versity.  And then I chose to um, get statements of purpose from another [unintelligible]versity of like [unintelligible] women of color.  And I showed it to them and they read it and they gave me feedback recorded as I am recording right now [laughter].  And um, so my paper is due next week.
0:01:01.8  0:01:2.0   MALE:  Oh, okay.
