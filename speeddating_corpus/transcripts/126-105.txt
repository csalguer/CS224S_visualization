00:05  	00:09  	FEMALE:  [laughter] what are you saying arch enemy?

00:10  	00:29  	MALE:  The evil cooking.  It [unintelligible] further down the row so I could have gotten a better interest like about -- I'm particularly interested how [unintelligible] is going to turn out.  I think that will be most amusing for my own personal enjoyment.

00:33  	00:45  	FEMALE:  Yeah, I find it.  Well, yeah, it's going to be hard [unintelligible] since we know each other.

00:50  	00:58  	MALE:  This is a great thing.  I know you and I know [unintelligible], so.  I don't know this is pretty interesting.  She was an education major so.  So, I don't know.

00:58  	01:06  	FEMALE:  Given that it was for the engineering department [unintelligible].

01:06  	01:18  	MALE:  Yeah, but I dare you to start one of your conversations so what do you think of [unintelligible].  No, no, no, that would be bad for the study.  That would be bad for the study, no, no, no.  So --

01:44  	01:53  	MALE:   Yeah, yeah.  But at least it helps us get both loosened up a little bit and kind of chilled for the 17 dates to come.

01:54  	02:00  	FEMALE:  Oh yeah [laughter].  Just take a break from like what's your name, where did you come from?

02:01  	02:05  	MALE:  Yeah, well at least she set me on the right path I'm going that way now.  Left.

02:07  	02:11  	FEMALE:  The guy I had before you, he knew the way clockwise?

02:11  	02:16  	MALE:  Just to be talked like this.  It all depends upon your perspective.  If you're looking from the down up --

02:16  	02:20  	FEMALE:  Its always pointing down.

02:20  	02:21  	MALE:  It's clockwise if you're pointing up.

02:21  	02:30	FEMALE:  Use your left hand.  See, now you're not an electrical engineer, because this is our -- what is it our [unintelligible] is there.

02:30  	02:31  	MALE:  It's the right hand -- well ---

02:31  	02:34  	FEMALE:  The right hand rule, use your right hand.

02:34  	02:35  	MALE:  For the field?  [unintelligible].

02:35  	02:36  	FEMALE:  Right and then when you use your left hand over there.

02:36  	02:38  	MALE:  It's all nameX's fault.

02:38  	02:39  	FEMALE:  Because she's [unintelligible] lefty.  

02:39  	02:39  	MALE:  Yes.

02:40  	02:41  	FEMALE:  And then Pete and Daniel, they're turning you lefty, too.

02:42  	02:46  	MALE:  Yes.  It's like you're turning me into an electrical engineer, they're turning me lefty.

02:46  	02:55  	FEMALE:  You're going on your own.  I just think you're [unintelligible].  It's doubtful that I think their trying to force that on you, but I did not. 

02:55  	03:05  	MALE:  [laughter] see, I'm not going to pick up the drinking habit from nameX and I'm not going to pick up the lefty habit from them.  I'll stay a righty.

03:06  	03:10  	FEMALE:  I notice you didn't say that you wouldn't pick up the electrical engineering habit from me.

03:10  	03:11  	MALE:  I'm in denial.

03:12  	03:15  	FEMALE:  But I'm not going to be fooled, but you're going to find out that eventually I was right.

03:15  	03:19  	MALE:  You see, you're competing with all mighty [unintelligible].

03:19  	03:21  	FEMALE:  Because he's driving you away?

03:21  	03:26  	MALE:  I think he would like take a bullet to keep me away from electrical engineering.

03:27  	03:29  	FEMALE: That is true friendship.

03:32  	03:38  	MALE:  [laughter] I see him taking a bullet for nameX to like get him out of -- well nameX [unintelligible], so.

03:38  	03:42  	FEMALE:  He's leaving.  You can use his Masters in a year.  Yeah.

03:42  	03:47  	MALE:  I have a new found respect for Daniel.

03:47  	03:53  	FEMALE:  The fact that he -- I mean he doesn't go out a lot, but I doesn't manage to get out.  So yeah.

03:53  	03:54  	MALE:  Man.

03:54  	03:59  	FEMALE:  But you -- I just want to let you know that you and Daniel are a package now.
