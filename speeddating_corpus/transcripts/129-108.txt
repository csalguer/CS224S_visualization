1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Yes.  
1:22 1:23 MALE:  So you took [unintelligible] per quarter.  
1:26 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's different when you don't have, you know, labs and building things, and--we don't have any of that.  
1:32 1:33 MALE:  Yeah, oh definitely, yeah.  
1:35 1:38 FEMALE:  It's much easier to do 15 units in a term.

1:39 1:45 MALE:  Uh-huh, so--yeah, what--like are you trying this for the first time, or you have been in a speed-dating [unintelligible] before?
1:47 1:54 FEMALE:  I have actually never speed dated.  I have thought about it.  I have had friends who have tried to get me to do it, but I've never done it.  Had you done it before?
1:52 1:54 MALE:  No, no, I have not done it before, but why this time do it?
1:56 1:58 FEMALE: I'm actually in a class with nameX.  
1:57 1:59 MALE:  Oh, so he forced you to do it?
2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  He didn't force us, but he--
2:00 2:02 MALE:  [interposing]  So you are a sensor actually.
2:05 2:05 FEMALE:  No.  
2:04 2:05 MALE:  You are a [unintelligible] participant.  
2:07 2:15 FEMALE:  No, I'm a full participant. There are actually a bunch of us from our class, and we're all in the same program and we decided that we would do it together, solidarity, you know.  
2:13 2:14 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  It's fun.  Why not?  
2:15 2:15 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  Might as well meet some new people, and--
2:18 2:19 MALE:  [interposing]  Right.  
2:21 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, and it's research, right?  
2:22 2:32 MALE:  Yes, so yeah.  Like what do you do actually in the sense, like what else would you like to go on and ask?  Like give me some hints so that I can carry them forward.  
2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  Give you some hints?  
2:33 2:33 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:36 2:36 FEMALE:  About?
2:34 2:37 MALE:  About what to ask and what not to--no, what to.  
2:39 2:43 FEMALE:  You can ask anything you want.  I can ask you questions.  
2:41 2:42 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead.  
2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah?  So, you've been in the states for three years?  
2:44 2:44 MALE:  Yeah. 
2:47 2:48 FEMALE:  And what do you think?  
2:47 2:49 MALE:  Well, I find this place wonderful.  
2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  Sunny.  
2:50 3:02 MALE:  Like I have lots--exactly, I have lots of people visiting from different areas to California and they just love it like one of my cousins from Chicago.  And like--I always see grey buildings.  At least there are some green things here.  
3:04 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's true.  I was on the East Coast before moving out here, and it's definitely blue sky, and green trees all the time.  I actually find it a little bit annoying.  I miss the winter, and snow, and coats, and sweaters, and--
3:15 3:20 MALE:  [interposing]  Well, I guess this is the best place to--if you want to live [unintelligible], you should live here.  
3:22 3:25 FEMALE:  That's true.  It's a great place. 
3:23 3:23 MALE:  Right.  
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  There's not much to dislike about it.  
3:26 3:36 MALE:  Right, because my friends who actually go for a job after [unintelligible] they always [unintelligible] area other than Washington or even Redmond and Washington.  
3:36 3:44 FEMALE:  I'm looking for a job now, and people are surprised that I'm willing to think to think about going back to the East Coast. 
3:42 3:48 MALE:  So, you are for a job which is something like HR in a company or something like--what exactly a job would be?  
3:50 3:52 FEMALE:  No, I'm looking mostly at jobs in non-profits.  
3:52 3:52 MALE:  And for example.  
3:55 4:03 FEMALE:  Doing all kinds of stuff that all of the organizations are working with schools and school districts, sort of urban education school reform.  
4:02 4:03 MALE:  That was too complicated, but that's okay.  
4:06 4:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was nice to meet you.  Have fun tonight.
