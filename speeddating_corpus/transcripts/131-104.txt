0:23 0:31 FEMALE:  I don't know.  Actually, I'm really enjoying meeting people. You know, I think if we were meeting at a [unintelligible] experience.  This way it's like [crosstalk].  
0:37 0:40 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Like, the students in my building don't talk to each other.

0:50 0:57 MALE:  Yeah, the only intervention I have is the guy [unintelligible] like stomps on my ceiling all the time.  I'm like, okay, you all need some time.  
0:57 1:15 FEMALE:  You know, actually I did realize that there is a [unintelligible] building, but none of them [unintelligible].  And they're all like Asian or Latin American.  And actually it turns out that a lot of people that I know and see every day are that live in my building really nice.  They [unintelligible].  
1:16 1:17 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've done that before.  
1:17 1:22 FEMALE:  I guess it's my fault in I'm not [unintelligible] village with.  
1:24 1:24 MALE:  How come?  
1:24 1:39 FEMALE:  It's not very good like when you do stuff like that.  Like, I know it's out there.  I actually would like these [unintelligible].  I know it's not [unintelligible], but-
1:41 1:43 MALE: [interposing]  No way, there's no girls in studio three.  Yes.  
1:43 1:48 FEMALE:  In fact, you'll probably meet her today.  She's really cool, nameX [unintelligible].  
1:50 1:50 MALE:  I haven't met her.  
1:50 2:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't think you met her yet. But, yeah, actually I know there's a lot of girls.  They all [unintelligible] the ones that I know.  What department are you from?  
2:02 2:03 MALE: I'm doing CS.  
2:04 2:08 FEMALE:  A lot of people are from that [unintelligible].  
2:10 2:11 MALE:  Yeah, it's lame.  I hate CS.  
2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
2:13 2:17 MALE:  Oh, they're cool.  They're pretty cool.  
2:17 2:17 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
2:18 2:26 MALE:  They're a little bit--no, I studied English for undergrad. Yeah, 28 I don't know, like--yes.  
2:25 2:28 FEMALE:  How does one get introduced to undergrad program here at Stanford.  
2:29 2:32 MALE:  I don't know.  Apply.  I got rejected from a lot of places.  
2:32 2:34 FEMALE:  Really?  [unintelligible].  
2:36 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, it's like the best one.  
2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  I would say you're doing something right.  
2:40 2:47 MALE:  I think there's just some applications they're like let's just really, really give this guy a hard time because they knew how hard it would be for me.  It's like I don't know.  
2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a lot of work.  
2:50 2:51 MALE: So, you're doing law?  
2:51 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:53 2:54 MALE:  That sounds intense.  
2:54 2:55 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's intense for the first year. 
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Are you a first-year?  
2:57 3:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, my friends and I who are here are all first-year, and, yeah, it's a lot of work.  But I think considering all the other law schools, most of the ones that are similar to Stanford, Stanford is like by far the most recommended.  Hopefully, [unintelligible] going out is totally like [unintelligible].  Actually, you know, I think I'm going to have a pretty good year.  Fortunately, [unintelligible].  
3:24 3:27 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, which is the law library?  
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  It's actually right across the street.  
3:31 3:33 MALE:  Is it in the law building?  
3:33 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uhm, if you're looking at the law school building, it's half [unintelligible], and so you have to look at [unintelligible] and see exactly what it is.  You can see all of the law students like in there doing everything.  
3:44 3:45 MALE:  Is it open late?  
3:45 3:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, actually during the week it's open until midnight.  
3:48 3:49 MALE:  Oh, that's not late.  
3:53 3:57 FEMALE:  How late is [unintelligible]?  
3:54 3:57 MALE:  Well, at my old school it was open until like 4:00 or 4:30.  Yeah.  
3:56 3:58 FEMALE:  Really?  What was your undergraduate?  
3:59 3:59 MALE:  In English.  
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  Oh. 
4:00 4:02 MALE:  In Florida.  
4:01 4:03 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you. Are you from Florida?  
4:05 4:09 MALE:  No, I'm from New York, but I lived in Florida.  I don't think we're allowed to talk anymore.  Anyway.
