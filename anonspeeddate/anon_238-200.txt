00:27  00:27	FEMALE:  Yeah.
00:28  00:31	MALE:  In the Engineering Department there really aren't that many women so.
00:32  00:32	FEMALE:  Yeah.
00:33  00:38	MALE:  I've probably seen more women in the past two hours than I probably have in the last three years.
00:39  00:40	FEMALE:  [laughter]
00:41  00:42	MALE:  Which is kind of sad to say I suppose.

01:05  01:08	MALE:  Everything.  But enjoying my time here [unintelligible]?
01:09  01:22	FEMALE:  Um, I'm a linguist and I'm in the Linguistics Department and I should be finishing this summer.  And my dissertation was on teaching linguistics to elementary students and what kind of effects that has.
01:23  01:23	MALE:  Congratulations.
01:24  01:30	FEMALE:  Thank you.  Well, I've got 15 pages or so to go, so you can't say congratulations yet.
01:31  01:31	MALE:  As long as there [unintelligible].
01:32  01:48	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Um, and ah, I like to live in alternative, intentional communities and I have a cat and um, that's about it.  Big sister of two, I'm the oldest not the baby.
01:49  01:49	MALE:  Really.
01:50  01:51	FEMALE:  So that's a different psychology.
01:51  01:53	MALE:   Absolutely.  So [unintelligible].
01:54  01:54	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:55  01:55	MALE:  [unintelligible].
01:56  01:59	FEMALE:  I think -- I think the older you said you had a big family how many is there?
02:00  02:01	MALE:  I have an older brother and a younger sister.
02:02  02:02	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
02:04  02:04	MALE:  Depends on your definition of type of family.
02:05  02:06	FEMALE:  Right, yeah.  
02:08  02:11	MALE:  So it's a pretty nice size family not like [unintelligible].
02:13  02:14	FEMALE:  I mean, from Indiana or?
02:15  02:15	MALE:  Colorado.
02:16  02:16	FEMALE:  Colorado.
02:17  02:20	MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty much the flat part of the state that [unintelligible].
02:21  02:22	FEMALE:  There gorgeous yeah.
02:22  02:23	MALE:  Exactly it wouldn't be our [unintelligible].
02:24  02:28	FEMALE:  Right.
02:29  02:40	MALE:  Um but yeah really like Colorado it's kind of laid back, but I really like that it's laid back here.  [unintelligible].
02:41  02:49	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I feel that way every time I go to New York, I step off the plane and I'm like uh, I can't take it -- I can't take it.  So it's too much.
02:50  02:53	MALE:  So help me on linguistics what are some of the things that you get to do?
02:54  03:23	FEMALE:  Um, well you know it's like any field; it's really varied depending on what you're interested in.  But I'm a socio-linguist first, which means I'm more interested in the human aspect of language.  So how people use language to identify themselves with different groups or how they use it to create their identities and their personalities.  Um, and I do applied socio-linguistics, which how we know about like what we know about language and culture, how can we use that to increase teaching and learning.  So, --
03:24  03:32	MALE:  Interesting, so, well, I won't even pretend to know, so you take some of those ideas and see how is the best way to approach teaching language to say young children.
03:33  03:33	FEMALE:  Right.
03:34  03:35	MALE:  So if they are bilingual [unintelligible].
03:35  03:41	FEMALE:  For instance you could do that, yeah.  You could say a lot about that.  Um, so, I like it, its interesting stuff.
03:42  03:43	MALE:  It's an important thing.
03:43  03:44	FEMALE:  Yeah, it's fun.
03:45  03:46	MALE:  It's amazing when you enjoy stuff; work doesn't seem like work anymore.
03:47  03:48	FEMALE:  Exactly.  Yeah, it's a very important thing.
03:49  03:54	MALE:  So in you're your linguistic department as a graduate PhD so do you actually get the chance to help [unintelligible].
03:55  04:04	FEMALE:  Yes, but not as much as I probably should.  Actually right now I've decided while I'm writing this is the only time [horn] in my life where my days are totally mine.
04:05  04:05	MALE:  Yeah.
04:06  04:10	FEMALE:  To create.  So, I'm laying in the sun a lot, which is --
04:11  04:12	MALE:  Well that's good.  Really nice to meet you.  Have a nice night.
04:12  04:13	FEMALE:  You too, male200.  Have a nice night.
