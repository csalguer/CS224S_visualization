0:00:27.2  0:00:33.2  FEMALE:  In a way.  You could argue that anthropology has, has it's own branch called education. 
0:00:35.5  0:00:36.2  MALE:  Uh-huh. 
0:00:33.7  0:00:52.2  FEMALE:  Educational anthropology.  But um, what I'm focusing on is um, specific issues in higher education of experiences of women of um, minority backgrounds; Asian-American, Jap--I'm sorry, my phone is distracting me. 
0:00:54.5  0:00:55.3  MALE:  [laughter].

This is [unintelligible] humanities [unintelligible] programs.  Because there's stigma's--I won't go on and on, but I'm just saying--there's stigma's attached to people of color when they are in the humanitites.  Oh, for example, "Oh, you're Chinese so you must do Chinese literature."  "Oh, that, you, you have credibility in that just because you're Chinese."  Or "Oh," you know "you're black.  That means you must do Toni Morrison.  How could you possible know anything about shakespeare?"  Well not that everybody beleives that.  I'm just saying that there are issues that come up about who is credible, who has--you know how these pressures and these assumptions affect your life  decisions--
