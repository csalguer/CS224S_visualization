0:00 0:00 FEMALE: Hi. 
0:00 0:03 MALE: Hello. My name is male309.
0:03 0:04 FEMALE: I'm female335.
0:04 0:05 MALE: female335?
0:05 0:05 FEMALE: Yes. 
0:06 0:06 MALE: Nice to meet you.
0:06 0:07 FEMALE: It's nice to meet you.
0:07 0:10 MALE: So this is O?  Is that right?
0:09 0:12 FEMALE: Yeah, that's an O.  Oh, this is station O. 
0:12 0:12 MALE: Station O.
0:12 0:14 FEMALE: Yes.  You're right. 
0:16 0:17 MALE: All right.  So what do you study here?
0:17 0:19 FEMALE: Um, I study biology. 
0:20 0:20 MALE: Biology?
0:20 0:20 FEMALE: Yeah, I study--
0:21 0:22 MALE: So are you doing [unintelligible], or--
0:22 0:25 FEMALE: Yes, yeah.  Population genetics.  I was a math major in college. 
0:26 0:26 MALE: Oh, so--
0:26 0:28 FEMALE: So, really, I'm a math person. 
0:29 0:34 MALE: Oh, hm.  So what, what made you change your major from that to biology?
0:33 0:45 FEMALE: Well, I didn't actually--I didn't change my major.  My--our group is all math students, and our advisor has a PhD in math, but we apply mathematics to biological data.  So that's why we're in the biology department.  
0:43 0:44 MALE: Oh.
0:46 0:48 FEMALE: So we're, like, the fake biology group.
0:48 0:48 MALE: Oh, okay. 
0:48 0:50 FEMALE: Everyone kind of makes fun of us because none of us know any biology. 
0:51 0:56 MALE: [laughter] Oh, okay.  So what, what specific problem are--your group is addressing?
0:56 1:22 FEMALE: Um, well, we do a lot of different things, but what I study is human evolution and, uh, the differences in genetic variation across genetic systems, like the X chromosome, the Y chromosome, mitochondrial DNA and sex--or the non-sex chromosomes.  And, uh, I also study the correlation between genetic distances and geographic distances.  So if populations are closer together, are they more closely related than if they're farther apart?
1:21 1:21 MALE: Um hm. 
1:22 1:25 FEMALE: And where are there exceptions to that rule, if there is a rule?
1:26 1:26 MALE: Oh. 
1:27 1:36 FEMALE: And then I study--a lot of what we do now--or a lot of what I do with my advisor is try to understand the patterns we're seeing from the results of the human genome project. Looking for patterns. 
1:38 1:40 MALE: [unintelligible] have you been in--
1:39 1:40 FEMALE: This is my third year.
1:41 1:41 MALE: Third year?  
1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:42 1:44 MALE: Ah.  Do you enjoy it?
1:43 1:47 FEMALE: I do.  I like it a lot.  Yeah.  What about you?  What are you studying?
1:48 1:52 MALE: Material Science and Engineering.  Yeah.  And this is my fifth year. 
1:52 1:54 FEMALE: Oh, great.  So you--
1:54 1:55 MALE: I enjoy it, too.
1:55 1:59 FEMALE: That's good.  Um, I've always been intrigued by material science. 
1:59 2:05 MALE: Um hm. Yeah.  Material science, basically, just studies the microstructure of materials. 
2:05 2:05 FEMALE: Right. 
2:05 2:11 MALE: And correlates that--and correlates that to the physical properties of materials. 
2:11 2:12 FEMALE: Whose group are you in?
2:13 2:13 MALE: Which group?
2:13 2:14 FEMALE: Yeah, who's your [unintelligible]?
2:14 2:16 MALE: Bob Sinclair [phonetic].  You know him?
2:16 2:17 FEMALE: No, I know nameX [phonetic]. 
2:17 2:18 MALE: Oh, you--how come you know him?
2:18 2:25 FEMALE: Um, he and my brother-in-law went to college together. My brother-in-law's a physicist, so they knew each other. 
2:24 2:25 MALE: Oh. Wow.
2:26 2:28 FEMALE: Yeah, and then I went to college at Stanford, so I know nameX [phonetic]. 
2:30 2:31 MALE: Oh, you were [unintelligible] here? 
2:31 2:31 FEMALE: Oh, yeah. 
2:31 2:36 MALE: Ah. Wow.  All right.   nameX is a big man, huh, for undergrads.
2:36 2:38 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah. Everybody knows him.  [laughter] 
2:38 2:45 MALE: Everybody know him.  Yeah. Yeah, he's the person who always kind of urged the sophomores to just declare a major, right?
2:45 2:56 FEMALE: Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, like, where he lives now, the freshman/sophomore college, all of that, it started when--in my second or third year in college.  So I remember when all of that was beginning. 
2:56 2:59 MALE: So what exactly is a freshman/sophomore college?  What does it mean?
2:59 3:20 FEMALE: Um, well, he's the Dean of it, and basically there are some freshman and sophomores who choose to live there.  And it's, like, a very academically oriented residence.  There are classes that are held there, and you can choose to live there for two years.  The sophomores kind of become mentors for the freshmen.  Uh, and there's just a lot more academic programing there than there is in the other residences.
3:20 3:21 MALE: Where is it?  Is it near Lyman [phonetic]?
3:21 3:23 FEMALE: Yes, exactly. 
3:22 3:27 MALE: Oh.  So all the students in there are, are--in that area are kind of--
3:26 3:30 FEMALE: Not all of them.  There are two that are part of one courtyard. 
3:30 3:31 MALE: Oh.  Is it Adams?
3:31 3:32 FEMALE: Adams and Schiff [phonetic].  Yeah. 
3:32 3:32 MALE: Adams and Schiff? 
3:34 3:40 FEMALE: Only those two, yeah.  The other ones, like, there are suites that are out there, other things.  Do you live in Lyman [phonetic]? Or are you--yeah?
3:38 3:41 MALE: Uh, used to live in Lyman, so I know that area a little bit.
3:41 3:43 FEMALE: Yeah, by the golf course. [laughter] 
3:43 3:43  MALE: Yeah, yeah. 
3:44 3:44 FEMALE: The driving range. 
3:44 3:45 MALE: And the tennis court, too.
3:45 3:49 FEMALE: Yeah. And the stables.  There's a lot of stuff out there. 
3:49 3:49 MALE: Yeah. 
3:50 3:50 FEMALE: So--
3:51 3:52 MALE: So what do you do in your spare time?
3:53 3:57 FEMALE: Um, right now, I'm working a lot, so not much. 
3:56 3:57 MALE: So you [unintelligible], huh?
3:57 3:59 FEMALE: Yeah, not much spare time, but--
4:00 4:04 MALE: Oh, gees. Well, it's been nice to--nice to meet you.
4:04 4:06 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  See you later.
