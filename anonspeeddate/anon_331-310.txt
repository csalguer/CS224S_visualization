00:06 00:06 MALE: Hi, I'm [unintelligible] 
00:10 00:10 FEMALE: Hi, I'm female331.  Nice to meet you.  
00:08 00:09 MALE: female331, nice to meet you.  
00:12 00:13 FEMALE: You're in the business school, I heard, from--
00:11 00:11 MALE: Yeah.  
00:14 00:14 FEMALE: Yeah.  
00:11 00:13 MALE: Yeah, I am.  How about you?  What school are you in?  
00:16 00:17 FEMALE: I'm grad school, English.  
00:15 00:16 MALE: English.  All right.  
00:18 00:19 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  
00:15 00:16 MALE: What do you do with that?  
00:20 00:21 FEMALE: Be a professor, I think.  
00:18 00:18 MALE: Okay.  
00:21 00:27 FEMALE: I'm pretty sure.  I don't know.  I was debating this myself the other day but, uh, I mean, there's nothing really else out there for us job-wise [laughter] so.  
00:24 00:25 MALE: Oh, that's--  
00:27 00:31 FEMALE: Teacher.  I mean, right, you know.  Nothing like [unintelligible].  What do you--do you want to do business?  
00:29 00:33 MALE: Uh, yeah.  I'd like to [unintelligible].  I'm going to the technology, mergers and acquisitions.  
00:37 00:37 FEMALE: The emergency what?  
00:35 00:36 MALE: Mergers and acquisitions.  
00:39 00:42 FEMALE: Oh, I thought you said emergency something.   I was thinking, like, med stuff.  
00:38 00:49 MALE: No, so basically, um, I'm going to go work for [unintelligible] systems.  And, um, [unintelligible] products and stuff.  
00:52 00:53 FEMALE: So you're done with Stanford then?  
00:50 00:51 MALE: I'm going to be done this quarter.  
00:55 00:57 FEMALE: Wow.  Tell me--where did you get your undergrad?  
00:54 00:55 MALE: USC.
00:58 00:59 FEMALE: I went to UCLA.  
00:56 00:57 MALE: Oh.  
00:59 01:00 FEMALE: Oh.  
00:57 01:00 MALE: We were just getting on well and then you had to say UCLA.  I'm, like...
01:02 01:05 FEMALE: [laughter] I don't know.  I think it's the opposite way around.  
01:04 01:09  MALE: It's all a game.    One of my best friends went to UCLA while I was at USC and we're just always, like--
01:11 01:12 FEMALE: When did you graduate?  
01:10 01:10 MALE: '98.  
01:13 01:16 FEMALE: Oh, so you graduated earlier.  And did you take time off or did you work?  
01:13 01:16 MALE: Uh, no, I worked straight.  So I've been working since.  
01:19 01:22 FEMALE: You worked--but you didn't work when you were going to school, like--
01:19 01:19 MALE: No, no.  
01:23 01:25 FEMALE: You went to school, you worked and then you decided business school because?
01:24 01:28 MALE: You know what, initially, coming out of school, I didn't think about it because I did engineering at school.  
01:30 01:32 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you did engineering at 'SC?  
01:30 01:35 MALE: Yeah, at 'SC and, you know, coming out here one day at business school and then I started working I met a lot of people who went to business school who ended up going.  
01:39 01:39 FEMALE: Yeah.  
01:36 01:40 MALE: And I'm, like, I can do that.  You know.  And, like, I know I'll eventually do business for myself. 
01:43 01:46 FEMALE: Do you know what you would have done if you didn't go to business school?  How would you--
01:44 01:45 MALE: I'd probably remain a consultant.  
01:48 01:51 FEMALE: That's what you were doing?  And this wasn't fulfilling for you or you just felt?  
01:49 01:50 MALE: Oh, it was very fulfilling, actually.  
01:52 01:53 FEMALE: But you just--
01:51 01:57 MALE: I loved it.  But the thing is I knew that for me to go to where I want to get to in life, um, as far as my professional life?  
02:00 02:00 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
01:58 02:00 MALE: Then business school would probably get it faster.  
02:03 02:03 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
02:01 02:03 MALE: So that was it.  
02:05 02:07 FEMALE: And was it worth it?  Like, [unintelligible]?  
02:06 02:08 MALE: I've learned so much about myself, I guess, that's why.
02:10 02:11 FEMALE: Really?  
02:08 02:24 MALE: And um, especially here.  I think that's very unique to Stanford as a school.  Just the way the program is.  It's very, um, the way it's built, it really teaches you to learn about yourself because it kind of a way is leadership.  It's about knowing yourself very well.   
02:27 02:27 FEMALE: Oh, that's interesting.  
02:26 02:29 MALE: And knowing how can [unintelligible] people [unintelligible].
02:32 02:40 FEMALE: That sounds psychological, like it seems like it's more of a psychological thing of how you're coming across and what to say and how to put people at ease and how to convince them that your idea is right [unintelligible].  
02:38 02:42 MALE: Exactly.  Yeah.  How about you?  What are you thinking?  I mean, are you going [unintelligible]?
02:46 02:55 FEMALE: I mean, I just started.  It's a five-year  teaching program, so I'm here.  But I should think since you know what LA's like, I mean, I lived in Westwood when I was going to UCLA and Palo Alto is so boring compared to Westwood.  
02:53 02:54 MALE: There's nothing here.  
02:56 03:02 FEMALE: I go out to San Francisco, you know, with some friends, but I don't have a car [unintelligible] cars.  I mean, what do you do?  
03:02 03:03 MALE: There's so nothing to do here.  You go to San Francisco.  
03:05 03:07 FEMALE: How often?  Do you live here?  
03:05 03:22 MALE: Um, I lived here, um, you know, I ended up not going as often as I thought I would because I lived in the area of the school.  I lived up towards San Francisco.  Um, but this quarter I think I made it out three times.  We're going out again tomorrow.  Um, but it's hard if you don't have a car especially.  
03:24 03:25 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
03:23 03:25 MALE: I mean, where do you go, like Rudy's or--
03:26 03:27 FEMALE: You're at the mercy of friends.  [laughter] 
03:25 03:27 MALE: You know, you go to Rudy's or [unintelligible] and get a blue [unintelligible].  
03:31 03:35 FEMALE: The only place that's open is like the Denny's.  It's like, it's like at two in the morning [unintelligible].  Come on, you know.  
03:38 03:39 MALE: I really like San Francisco.    
03:36 03:40 FEMALE: You know, it leads on to that.  So I don't know [unintelligible] because I'm not [laughter] 
03:40 03:42 MALE: Like, where I, okay, nameX in the Box, let's go.  
03:43 03:48 FEMALE: Yeah, but I just feel like [unintelligible] because I'm used to, like, there being a lot of things to do and--
03:46 03:47 MALE: Yeah.  
03:48 03:52 FEMALE: I don't know, it's a little weird for me to be--it was kind of a smaller area.  
03:51 03:51 MALE: Are you living [unintelligible] on campus?  
03:53 03:56 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm on the grad, Escondido Village.  
03:54 03:54 MALE: Okay.  
03:56 03:56 FEMALE: Did you live off-- 
03:56 03:58 MALE: No, I used--well, first year I lived at Scwab [phonetic].  
03:59 04:00 FEMALE: Oh, that's the business area.  
03:59 04:00 MALE: And my second year I'm living--you know the [unintelligible]?  
04:03 04:03 FEMALE: Yes.  
04:01 04:03 MALE: Yeah, I'm living right by [unintelligible].
04:05 04:08 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  So you're in Palo Alto but [unintelligible].  Well, it was nice seeing you.  
04:07 04:07 MALE: Really nice meeting you.  
04:09 04:10 FEMALE: male310?  
04:09 04:10 MALE: [unintelligible] 
04:11 04:12 FEMALE: Okay.  Cool.  
04:10 04:11 MALE: Pleasure meeting you.
