0:01:51.1 0:01:51.7 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:50.1 0:01:53.2 MALE:  And she said that being in the South is way more of a culture shock than being in England.

0:02:45.4 0:02:58.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, the- the border of the Valley it's like, America really influences the Mexican cities along the border, and Mexico influences the American cities.  So it's just like this big completely independent area. 
0:02:57.1 0:02:59.5 MALE:  Like- like is it very bi-cultural, like there's a lot--
0:03:00.4 0:03:03.9 FEMALE:  Very bi-cultural-  I mean, like there's Wal-Marts and Home Depots-
0:03:02.4 0:03:03.2 MALE:  Right. 
0:03:03.9 0:03:06.3 FEMALE:  -in- on the border cities in Mexico.

0:03:12.8 0:03:13.3 MALE:  Right.
0:03:14.1 0:03:14.9 FEMALE:  So.

0:03:51.2 0:03:55.3 FEMALE:   He's actually kind of arrogant, but like don't repeat that to him.
0:03:53.7 0:03:55.2 MALE:  You know, my professors tend to-
0:03:53.9 0:03:54.5 [horn]
0:03:54.2 0:03:56.7 MALE:  -so I wouldn't [unintelligible] [laughter].
0:03:57.5 0:03:59.0 FEMALE:  Him more so than others.
0:03:57.3 0:03:58.3 MALE:  Right [laughter].
0:03:59.8 0:04:00.5 FEMALE:  Um, but--
0:03:58.6 0:03:59.9 MALE: I forget [unintelligible].
0:04:01.0 0:04:04.0 FEMALE:  But, no, I mean, I would definitely take a class from him for sure.
0:04:01.8 0:04:02.2 MALE:  Yeah.
