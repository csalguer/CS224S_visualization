0:00:47.7 0:00:49.6 MALE:  Oh wow.  Oh, so you're math, too?
0:00:45.8 0:00:46.2 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:00:53.5 0:00:56.1 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:01:00.6 0:01:07.0 MALE:  That would be great.  Or you could actually be like the sleeper person who like- you know you're like [unintelligible] or whatever her name is.
0:01:03.1 0:01:04.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] 
0:01:08.0 0:01:09.5 MALE:  I guess nobody [unintelligible] you're in a different program. 
0:01:04.6 0:01:08.0 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] this is the second time somebody accused me of being a spy.  
0:01:11.1 0:01:13.9 MALE:  Well I'm not accusing you, I'm just like hypothesizing.
0:01:09.9 0:01:13.5 FEMALE:  Someone else told me that I was a plant.  Yeah, that I was placed here.
0:01:15.3 0:01:22.8 MALE:  Oh really?   No, no.  So- so how do you get into, uh, education?  How did you get interested in teaching?
0:01:18.8 0:01:39.0 FEMALE:  Uh, well I was working full time in New York City and I just wanted a change.  So I actually moved out here, um, three years ago and I did a bunch of math classes at San Jose State to get ready.  So I wasn't really sure if I wanted to teach or what.  So I did some extra schooling and then applied.  So, I don't know.  What are you studying?
0:01:41.1 0:01:44.5 MALE:  Wow.  Just- um, well I did an MBA. 
0:01:41.3 0:01:41.7 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:44.5 0:01:48.5 MALE:  And now I'm doing an, uh, electrical engineering degree.
0:01:44.9 0:01:46.5 FEMALE:  Oh.  You're a school addict?  
0:01:50.1 0:01:53.3 MALE:  Yeah, well- no actually I'm working half- part time.  So-
0:01:48.5 0:01:49.6 FEMALE:  No.  I'm just teasing.
0:01:53.3 0:01:56.1 MALE:  So no, no, no, I'm okay.  I probably do have a school problem.
0:01:51.0 0:01:54.8 FEMALE:  Where do you-  I have a school problem.  I mean I want to be a teacher, right?
0:01:58.1 0:02:00.9 MALE:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh that's true.  Yeah, who- come on.
0:01:57.5 0:01:58.5 FEMALE:  I know.  So-
0:02:02.1 0:02:02.8 MALE:  So-
0:01:58.8 0:02:00.6 FEMALE:  What's the expression?  The pot and the kettle?
0:02:04.1 0:02:10.3 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  So, yeah, no, I'm- uh, I'm- I'm doing the EE degree and then I work, you know, also.
0:02:06.9 0:02:07.6 FEMALE:  Okay.  Where do you work?
0:02:11.2 0:02:14.0 MALE:  Uh, I work at a company called Veritas Software.
0:02:10.6 0:02:11.0 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:14.4 0:02:16.7 MALE:  So they're local in Mountain View.  I grew up in this area.
0:02:13.2 0:02:13.6 FEMALE:  Oh.
0:02:17.0 0:02:22.2 MALE:  And I can't get out of this area that's my problem. But, uh, the weather's nice so I can't leave the city.
0:02:18.1 0:02:19.2 FEMALE:  Do you know Los Charros?	
0:02:23.1 0:02:24.9 MALE:  Yes.  Mountain View I love that place.
0:02:21.3 0:02:23.3 FEMALE:  One of my student's father owns that restaurant.
0:02:26.5 0:02:27.0 MALE:  Really? 
0:02:23.3 0:02:23.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:27.2 0:02:30.8 MALE:  That is like the nicest people there ever and they just have great food.
0:02:25.4 0:02:28.0 FEMALE:  I know, the Sipple Veta.
0:02:31.2 0:02:32.5 MALE:  Yeah.  The what?
0:02:28.8 0:02:30.4 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] The Sipple Veta.
0:02:33.7 0:02:34.6 MALE:  Sipple Vetas?
0:02:31.4 0:02:32.9 FEMALE:  I- I teach a student, nameX.
0:02:36.3 0:02:37.1 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:02:33.6 0:02:34.9 FEMALE:  They're really nice people.
0:02:38.1 0:02:44.9 MALE:  Wow.  Yeah, no, I- I love that.  We go there all the time.  [unintelligible] We're like only three or four minutes away from there.  So-
0:02:40.9 0:02:44.2 FEMALE:  That's good.  You should frequent there.  They are really nice people.  It's a good restaurant to support.
0:02:46.3 0:02:52.7 MALE:  Yeah.  Well it is.  I mean, you know, the funny thing is- is that I'm surprised because like most of the restaurants there are Asian restaurants. 
0:02:49.0 0:02:49.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:53.0 0:03:03.1 MALE:  And they're like pretty much- I don't know I'm- I can't tell the difference between a lot of these things.  So I figure that someone should do like an acquisition.  Like one should acquire another one and like shut each other down.
0:02:56.7 0:03:02.3 FEMALE:  [laughter] Be a big Mountain View conglomerate.  [laughter] 
0:03:03.7 0:03:08.9 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know.  But I think it's getting a little bit sort of nicer in downtown Mountain View. 
0:03:05.3 0:03:09.1 FEMALE:  It is.  I lived there when I first moved out here.  I lived in the Avalon Apartments.
0:03:12.6 0:03:14.1 MALE:  Okay.  That sounds very familiar.
0:03:11.0 0:03:14.4 FEMALE:  Do you know where Caldron is, like by the train station? Anyway.  I lived over there.
0:03:16.7 0:03:17.8 MALE:  Oh.  Okay.	
0:03:14.8 0:03:22.0 FEMALE:  And, um, well there was a lot of empty buildings.  I guess that was right after the burst.  You know, it was like 2002.
0:03:23.2 0:03:26.4 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:03:22.8 0:03:24.5 FEMALE:  So everybody was broke.
0:03:27.7 0:03:28.6 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:03:25.4 0:03:31.4 FEMALE:  So, but now, I was just there last night and it was just like, you know, restaurants, people out on the- on the sidewalk.
0:03:34.2 0:03:35.1 MALE:  It's amazing.
0:03:31.7 0:03:32.7 FEMALE:  It was really cool.
0:03:35.1 0:03:39.7 MALE:  It's amazing at how much it's been sort of, uh- someone must have put a lot of money in there.  
0:03:36.3 0:03:36.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:39.7 0:03:48.6 MALE:  I don't know.  But, uh, you know, my- I've like known that area for a very long time, my father used to-  like my father is a doctor and he had a clinic for a long time.
0:03:42.9 0:03:43.3 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:48.3 0:03:53.7 MALE:  So we used to just sort of hang out in the area while he was seeing patients, you know, and so-
0:03:50.5 0:03:57.1 FEMALE:  It must be strange to see how much-  I feel like people who have lived here for a while say that the area has really been built up.  Do you have that sense?
0:04:00.3 0:04:07.2 MALE:  Well, yes.  Because when I first, you know- my first memory of this place was like being in an orchard. 
0:04:06.9 0:04:09.3 [horn]
0:04:10.3 0:04:14.6 MALE:  Whoa.  That was- anyway, it was nice meeting you.
0:04:10.9 0:04:12.2 FEMALE:  Thanks.  It was nice to meet you.
