0:03 0:04 MALE:  Yeah, no it's [unintelligible].  
0:04 0:07 FEMALE:  No.  I know.  It's giving me like a headache.  I'm going to hear [unintelligible].

0:12 0:13 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  How's it going so far?
0:14 0:17 FEMALE:  Pretty good.  I'm kind of like blurring over though a little bit.  
0:17 0:18 MALE:  Yeah, I [unintelligible].  
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:20 0:21 MALE:  I'm not used to talking about myself this much.  
0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  I know.  Me neither.  
0:22 0:23 MALE:  And I'm like all of these questions. 
0:24 0:28 FEMALE:  Interesting conversation [unintelligible].  I'm like, okay, you like sound really boring.  
0:31 0:32 MALE:  But the thing is it's always the first turn with someone else.  
0:33 0:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:34 0:35 MALE:  Yeah, so which program are you in?
0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  I'm in geophysics.
0:37 0:37 MALE:  Oh, cool.  
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  How about you?
0:38 0:44 MALE:  Political science.  Political science.  I'm doing the doctoral program in my third year.  Do you like the geophysics program?
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, I enjoy it.  
0:45 0:47 MALE:  Is that it's own department, or is it, uh--
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  It's its own department.
0:49 0:49 MALE:  Oh cool. 
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] earth sciences.  
0:51 0:51 MALE:  Okay.  
0:52 0:54 FEMALE: There's four departments [unintelligible]. 
0:55 0:58 MALE:  Which--have you just started, or which area are you in?  
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Second year.
0:58 0:59 MALE:  Okay, how do you like it so far?
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  Good.  
1:01 1:02 MALE:  Is it mainly coursework so far?
1:02 1:06 FEMALE:  I had--first year was mainly course.  I started research [unintelligible].  
1:07 1:07 MALE:  Oh cool.  What's that?
1:08 1:10 FEMALE:  I'm looking at [crosstalk] physics.
1:11 1:11 MALE:  Right.  
1:12 1:18 FEMALE:  No, no, I'm just--I tend to say it really, really fast.  And I'm not sure if--like it just kind of sounds like it's rote memorization.  
1:18 1:19 MALE:  Right.  
1:20 1:22 FEMALE:  So, I don't know.  Like, I really enjoy it, but it might not sound interesting.  
1:23 1:25 MALE:  I've been working on research [unintelligible] like everyone else.  
1:26 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  I study, uhm, ways to use nuclear magnetic resonance on chemical changes [unintelligible].
1:33 1:39 MALE:  Oh, cool.  My dad--my dad's a chemist, and his dissertation was on NMR.  
1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  Right.  
1:39 1:40 MALE:  I couldn't begin to understand it, but like I tried.  
1:41 1:44 FEMALE:  There are different kinds of NMR.  See, I can't even say it anymore. 
1:44 1:45 MALE:  It's been a long day.  
1:46 1:48 FEMALE:  He probably did microscopy whereas I do more image and perception. 
1:48 1:53 MALE:  Right, this was also like 20, 30 years ago or something.  Things might have changed since then.  
1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:54 1:57 MALE:  Who knows?  Do you like the program?  Are the people, like the other people? 
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a really good program.  
1:58 1:59 MALE:  Oh, cool.
1:59 2:01 FEMALE:  Pretty nice people.  Easy to get along with program. 
2:01 2:10 MALE:  Yeah, it's like the science people are too--like political sciences is like on the other side of campus.  Like, they do the real find thing.  We don't make it over there very often.  
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  And hanging in the lab. 
2:13 2:13 MALE:  Right.  
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  You guys actually talk to people.  
2:16 2:20 MALE:  Well, don't--you know, fortunately we're still kind of a bit solitary. 
2:21 2:22 FEMALE:  So what do you do?  
2:22 2:27 MALE:  I'm interested in like comparators, economic and political history, mainly like Europe and the U.S.  
2:27 2:27 FEMALE: Okay. 
2:28 2:36 MALE:  But it's really nice.  Like, it's a really nice place to work.  I'm like mainly in German politics and U.S. politics, but more also economic and public policy.  
2:36 2:42 FEMALE:  How like how they relate or how they like--yeah.
2:43 2:44 MALE:  Yeah, like how they're different and stuff.  
2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  How they're different or like in this period of time?
2:46 3:04 MALE:  It's all--it's all those things.  It's like some [unintelligible] things that basically are some countries different from each other, like richer versus poor, democratic versus not, and the U.S. certainly did sort of like how they develop and stuff.  You have to understand a bunch of other countries not just the U.S. and Europe.  So, but [unintelligible] how some countries can travel to others. 
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  Right.  
3:06 3:09 MALE:  And getting across the idea that every country is so different that you can't really compare a lot.  
3:10 3:13 FEMALE:  I would think that German politics [unintelligible].  
3:13 3:14 MALE:  They are, and sort of--
3:15 3:17 FEMALE:  [interposing]  In fact, I think American politics would be kind of different from most other places.  
3:17 3:31 MALE:  Most places.  So, that's actually the one thing people want to say--look, America is so different from everywhere else.  But like looking at the history--yeah, so part of the job is to kind of understand like in what ways are the similarities useful, and in what ways are the differences useful?
3:31 3:32 FEMALE:  Right, okay. 
3:32 3:42 MALE:  It's [unintelligible] scientific I think, but it's a way of approaching [unintelligible].  Mainly trying to be anticipating is the main goal I have like--but I like it a lot.  
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:43 3:45 MALE:  Right, exactly, right.  That's really what life is about.  
3:45 3:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, I kind of talked about what I do.  I kind of--
3:49 3:58 MALE:  Right.  Yeah, I like the program a lot.  Like, it's really--it's a very like [unintelligible] in place like [unintelligible].  it's a very like friendly place like not competitive.  I don't know.  
3:58 3:59 FEMALE:  Do you get to go to Germany?  
4:00 4:05 MALE:  That's the plan actually.  I [unintelligible] the summer in Berlin.  It was amazing.  Definitely go, a fun place.  
4:05 4:05 FEMALE:  I've been.  
4:06 4:08 MALE:  Like did you live--do you know where you--
4:08 4:11 FEMALE:  No, I went to [unintelligible] and Heidelberg.  
4:12 4:14 MALE:  Okay.  [unintelligible] beautiful.
