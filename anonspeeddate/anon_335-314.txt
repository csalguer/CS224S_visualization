2:05 2:16 FEMALE: Right.  I know at home, like, my parents--I mean, it's funny.  We don't really talk that much [unintelligible] at home, either, but my sister and I always know when they don't want us to know what they're saying because they'll talk in, like, Bengali or something.  We're like, "Oh, what's going on?"
2:18 2:25 MALE: Oh, really?  My, my dad's Hindi is terrible, so my mom will talk to him in Hindi when she doesn't want him to understand when she's talking to her sister.  So it's just kind of funny.

2:26 2:30 MALE: His Hindi is [speaks a foreign language]. 
2:29 2:36 FEMALE: I know.  Yeah, I wish I knew more Hindi.  I met--my big gripe with my parents is they never taught us how to read or write [unintelligible], and I wish I knew or anything.
2:37 2:42 MALE: It's funny because actually, my reading and writing is a lot better than speaking because I read [unintelligible] internet newspapers. 
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: Really?
2:42 2:48 MALE: Yeah, so that's actually--so I can't speak it, but if they write it down, I can actually understand it a lot better. 
2:47 2:54 FEMALE: Wow.  That's funny.  My--yeah, my mom keeps telling me, she's like, it's so easy to learn.  I'll teach you.  When?  [laughter]  I'd really like to learn.
2:55 2:59 MALE: Right.  I mean now, you're brain structures have somewhat solidified, so it's less plastic, right?  But--
2:56 3:05 FEMALE: Right. Yeah. My cousin's make fun of me because we lived in Germany for a year.  I went to school there in junior high.  Yeah, and I speak--

3:13 3:20 FEMALE: Okay. [laughter]. But, uh, um, yeah, my cousins make fun of me.  They're like, "You speak better German than you do [unintelligible]."
3:21 3:22 MALE: Oh, really?  Wow. 
3:21 3:21 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:22 3:35 MALE: Yeah, I mean, I should've taken Spanish, but I took--so I [unintelligible] minimal [unintelligible], minimal German, uh, French and English.  So you're [unintelligible] Bengali, obviously English and, uh, and German.  Right.

3:49 3:52 MALE: Um hm.  Have you--you use Emax [phonetic] now, right?  Yeah, okay.  Awesome.
3:50 3:59 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course.  But, uh, it took me a while to [unintelligible], I have to admit.  Just like recently, I just moved out of Pine recently.  Like, I loved Pine.
