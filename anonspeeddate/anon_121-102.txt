FILE NAME: 121_102

0:00 0:02 MALE: It's all right.  Take your time.

0:13 0:17 FEMALE: So what school are you in, male102? [laughter] 

0:12 0:12 MALE: What's your program?

0:18 0:19 FEMALE: male102.  [laughter] 

0:13 0:16 MALE: male102, yeah I crossed that out.

0:21 0:37 FEMALE: I saw you.  It's funny when you know someone has certain name.  Like I know that male102 is something that you're, you know, you said parts of your family call you that but I can't even like, it seems so foreign.  Do you know what I mean?

0:32 0:32 MALE: Yeah.

0:38 0:39 FEMALE: It's just weird, it's weird.

0:33 0:36 MALE: To call me male102 would just throw you off.

0:42 0:43 FEMALE: It does, it throws me off.

0:37 0:42 MALE: It throws me off sometimes too, when my extended family calls male102 and I'm not used to it.

0:48 0:52 FEMALE: My sister calls me female121 and she's the only person on the whole planet that does that.

0:47 0:50 MALE: See, I might call you female121 only because my sister is female121.

0:56 0:56 FEMALE: Right.

0:51 0:55 MALE: And I-I call her female121 now sometimes and she's [unintelligible]

1:01 1:02 FEMALE: Oh she is?

0:56 0:59 MALE: And it pisses her off sometimes because I still call her female121.  I am female121.

1:06 1:19 FEMALE: [laughter] I just forget.  I mean, I know it's my name but it doesn't ring--like there's something about it that doesn't ring to me.  So when people say it I sort of know they're referencing me but it's like, it doesn't register as much as female121 does.

1:13 1:16 MALE: Yeah, if somebody yelled out male102 I wouldn't be nearly as likely to hear it.

1:22 1:24 FEMALE: Right, right.

1:19 1:20 MALE: Because nobody around here knows me as male102.

1:28 1:30 FEMALE: Interesting that they wrote that down.  Who did that?

1:24 1:28 MALE: They did it right like so on all the forms I fill out, I always put male102.

1:34 1:38 FEMALE: And I put female121 on a lot of them too because it's my formal name.

1:31 1:37 MALE: But on this one, I'm pretty sure I put male102 and then I put in parentheses male102.  They went with the male102. 

1:43 1:44 FEMALE: They didn't listen.

1:38 1:40 MALE: In fact nameX tried to change it and they were like nope.

1:48 1:49 FEMALE: Official research.

1:42 1:44 MALE: male102, officially.  It would throw off--

1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Official research.

1:47 1:47 MALE: Exactly.

1:53 2:01 FEMALE: I like it.  I'm kind of curious what they do with all of this.  I want to see.

1:56 2:11 MALE: I don't know and I worry I'm not giving them very good data.  [laughter] It twinges my conscience but then again it's their fault, they're blowing the horn so--

2:17 2:28 FEMALE: They are blowing the horn and I feel like the stuff at the bottom.  I hardly [unintelligible].  I feel really badly and especially because that's rating someone.  It's kind of-it's mean isn't it?

2:22 2:27 MALE: It's weird.  Well I feel like you have to quantify it on sort of narrow dimensions. That's what you're doing.

2:32 2:34 FEMALE: Yeah, it's true.

2:28 2:32 MALE: And it's you don't know the person, you don't know them and--

2:37 2:47 FEMALE: No.  I can't even think anymore.

2:45 2:48 MALE: Yeah, well you're in luck.  This is the last one.

2:54 2:55 FEMALE: The last one, right?

2:50 2:55 MALE: Yeah, do people tell you you're the second female121 in a row?  Actually it's a female121 right before you.

3:01 3:06 FEMALE: No, no one's told me.  That's interesting.  It's interesting also that nobody made that connection.

3:02 3:04 MALE: I think the names kind of become a blur a little bit too.

3:10 3:14 FEMALE: They do.  Station A, station A.  [laughter] 

3:17 3:19 MALE: How have you liked it?  Is this what you expected?

3:27 3:35 FEMALE: I guess, yeah kind of.  I didn't really know what to expect. I didn't have any sort of preconceived notion of what I thought it was going to be so.

3:31 3:35 MALE: I had very low expectations.  And it's exceeded them marginally.

3:42 3:55 FEMALE: Very.  [laughter] I guess--but I think it's too many.  Here, we can critique.  [laughter]

3:47 3:51 MALE: This will be helpful feedback if you're listening to us.  [horn] 

3:58 4:12 FEMALE: No, I think it's too many.  Like I started really--like I think people have started saving by 15 or by even, you know what I mean?  I'm like--so the conversation's like, even if you're a really friendly person you're just like oh my God.

4:06 4:08 MALE: It is, which-

4:14 4:14 FEMALE: Right?

4:08 4:19 MALE: Yes. Well on top of it it's sort of stressful to be going-I mean, it's high on a stress situation to begin with and then to have to evaluate people in a ridiculously short amount of time after that is ultra-stressful.

4:23 4:28 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, agreed.  Agreed.

4:23 4:24 MALE: What did they just say?  Something important?

[male tape ends here]

@4:29 5:04 FEMALE: What did they say?  Shall we high five right in front of them?  [laughter] [whispering] because I think a lot of people had me as T. But then I don't know what they had nameX as because S is the last one over there and then IA, and I think a lot of people had me as T.  So I let them know because they might have then put you--  Like, I don't know what--

@5:05 5:06 MALE: They can probably figure it out.

@5:06 5:22 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  I didn't do many of them, I was too late.  Would I give you my email address?  You already have my email address.

@5:22 5:24 MALE: I do have your email address.

@5:23 5:29 FEMALE: [laughter] 

@5:29 5:31 MALE: You're getting a little--

@5:31 5:43 FEMALE: I'm tired.  I have so much reading to do and [unintelligible] paper that I have to write for that man over there.  Wrote a paper that I have to write for that man over--  [laughter] 

@5:44 5:47 MALE: [unintelligible] 

@5:48 5:56 FEMALE: Oh yeah.  Which of these poor--oh God.  [whispering]

@5:56 5:58 MALE: [unintelligible] 

@5:58 6:00 FEMALE: Sure, I'll give you my email just because you already have it.
