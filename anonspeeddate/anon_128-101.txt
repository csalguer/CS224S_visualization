1:26 1:28 MALE:  What do you do?  Do you study minerals?
1:29 1:43 FEMALE:  I study rocks, yes.  I am in--I'm looking at, uhm, [unintelligible] so using [unintelligible] magnetic [unintelligible].  
1:44 1:46 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] very exciting.  
1:48 1:52 MALE:  So, what, uh, what else do you do?
