0:28 0:28 MALE:  [laughter] 
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  So which program are you in? 
0:29 0:30 MALE:  I'm an electrical engineer. You?
0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  Industrial engineer, did you say? 
0:34 0:34 MALE:  No, electrical. 
0:34 0:37 FEMALE:  Electrical engineer.  I thought you said industrial--my dad was an industrial engineer.  
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Okay. 
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  I'm in the MBA program.  
0:40 0:40 MALE:  Okay, cool. 
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Its fun. 
0:41 0:41 MALE:  You're my first business student. 
0:42 0:42 FEMALE:  Really? 
0:43 0:43 MALE:  There's no business students. 
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  That you've met at all? 
0:44 0:44 MALE:  Yeah.  I've been here--
0:45 0:45 FEMALE:  Is this your first year in the program? 
0:46 0:46 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  It's first year.  
0:47 0:50 FEMALE:  Oh, my first year too.  So you're the first engineering student at all that I've met.  
0:51 0:51 MALE:  Wow.  
0:52 0:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's sad how the PhD students don't ever really interact or anything. 
0:57 1:01 MALE:  Um, it's kind of nature of the beast. [laughter] 
1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  So how many people are in your program? 
1:03 1:07 MALE:  Uh, in electrical engineering school? Or the department, I think there's something like 600 or 800 grad students.  
1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Really? 
1:08 1:08 MALE:  It's ridiculous.  
1:09 1:09 FEMALE:  Are you kidding? 
1:10 1:10 MALE:  Yeah, it's huge. 
1:11 1:14 FEMALE:  Do you guys have like big electrical engineering parties and stuff?  [laughter] 
1:15 1:17 MALE:  [laughter] 
1:18 1:19 FEMALE:  Come on. 
1:20 1:20 MALE:  Um, we have happy hours on Friday afternoons.  
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  That's exciting.  
1:24 1:24 MALE:  It's a small group. 
1:24 1:26 FEMALE:  Do you feel like there's any sort of bond with your classmates or not really? 
1:26 1:26 MALE:  No.  
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  No? 
1:27 1:29 MALE:  It's too big, too big.  There's some like, you get to know the people in the research group that you're in. 
1:30 1:31 FEMALE:  I had no idea that it was that big.  
1:32 1:36 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, it's huge.  It's, it's easiest largest grad school, graduate department. 
1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  Wow.  
1:38 1:38 MALE:  Um--
1:38 1:40 FEMALE:  So what are you going to do with electrical engineering?  
1:41 1:41 MALE:  Um--
1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  A PhD, teach?  
1:42 1:43 MALE:  I don't really know.  [laughter] 
1:44 1:45 FEMALE:  [laughter] Is this a play folder, like a seven year play folder?  
1:46 1:53 MALE:  [laughter] No, no, no.  Research seems interesting.  Um, and I'm only in the first year of the program so--
1:54 1:56 FEMALE:  Oh yeah, that's right.  How long is it?  Like six years? 
1:57 2:00 MALE:  I think six years is like the, the average. 
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Wow.  
2:02 2:02 MALE:  I think the median is, the median is somewhere like five years. 
2:03 2:04 FEMALE:  That's a big commitment. 
2:05 2:05 MALE:  The medians--
2:05 2:06 FEMALE:  That's a big commitment, I'm impressed.  
2:07 2:20 MALE:  So, well it's, its, I graduated five years ago from college and so, I was out working six years ago.  Six years ago, I was out working for five years and then decided that I wanted to go back to school for a PhD.  So this is like--
2:21 2:22 FEMALE: For six years you wanted to go back to school?  Wow.  [laughter] 
2:23 2:24 MALE:  Well, five, five years.  
2:25 2:25 FEMALE:  [laughter] That's the goal? 
2:26 2:26 MALE:  And then one.  So--
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:27 2:38 MALE:  The goal is, I don't know, we'll see.  I want, I want, I want to do it, I want do it smartly, but I want [unintelligible].  So it's a question of pace. 
2:39 2:43 FEMALE:  So are you really busy with the program, or are you able to like, do fun things and--
2:44 2:45 MALE:  Yes and yes.  [laughter] 
2:46 2:47 FEMALE:  [laughter]  You make time for the fun things, right? 
2:48 2:56 MALE:  Uh, yeah, you have to make time for what I consider [unintelligible] priority.  So it happens.  I don't have nearly as much free time as I used to. 
2:57 2:57 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:57 3:05 MALE:  Nearly as much.  So you know, I don't get out and, and like when I was, when I was working I actually like went out and played like adult league hockey, stuff like that. 
3:06 3:06 FEMALE:  Wow.  
3:07 3:08 MALE:  Then I just [unintelligible] 
3:09 3:09 FEMALE:  Where were you before? 
3:10 3:10 MALE:  I was in uh, D.C.  
3:11 3:13 FEMALE:  Oh, eco-size.  Is this your first time on the West Coast? 
3:14 3:17 MALE:  Uh, first time living on the West Coast.  I was born here actually.  
3:18 3:18 FEMALE:  Oh really? 
3:19 3:20 MALE:  Yeah, in the L.A. area. 
3:21 3:21 FEMALE:  I'm going to be in L.A. for the summer.  
3:22 3:22 MALE:  Oh cool, cool. 
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:23 3:23 MALE:  So are you a West Coaster? 
3:24 3:26 FEMALE:  No, I'm um, I grew up in the Midwest.  
3:27 3:27 MALE:  Okay. 
3:27 3:32 FEMALE:  I was born in Texas but grew up in the Midwest, and then I went to college and lived in New York for five years and so--
3:33 3:33 MALE:  Okay. 
3:33 3:36 FEMALE:  --I've been on the East Coast, so this is really my first time living on the West Coast, but I think I'm going to stay here.  
3:37 3:38 MALE:  Okay, so where do you call home? 
3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  I call Wichita home. 
3:40 3:40 MALE:  Wichita. 
3:41 3:41 FEMALE:  Wichita, Kansas. 
3:42 3:42 MALE:  I know Wichita. 
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  [laughter] 
3:44 3:46 MALE: My, my, my mother was an air force brat.  
3:47 3:47 FEMALE:  Oh really? 
3:48 3:49 MALE:  And she went to high school in Wichita.
3:50 3:50 FEMALE:  Wow. 
3:50 3:53 MALE:  So that would be the closest to home that she's got.  And I biked through Kansas this summer. 
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  [laughter] Wow. 
3:56 3:56 MALE:  Yeah. 
3:56 3:58 FEMALE:  It's flat, not a lot of hills.  It's not even a good place to buy food. [laughter] 
3:59 4:05 MALE:  So where were we?  Where were we?  We were in yeah, we came through those.  I mean--
4:06 4:06 FEMALE:  Those are actually pretty. 
4:07 4:10 MALE:  They're really pretty, they're really pretty.  But the um, we're outside of Hutchinson, Kansas. 
4:11 4:13 FEMALE: Mm-hmm, which is right next to Wichita.
4:14 4:15 MALE:  Yeah.  And we ran into--
           [horn]
4:17 4:17 FEMALE:  [laughter]
4:18 4:24 MALE:  We ran into another cyclist who said anyone who said that Kansas, obviously hasn't biked across it. 
4:24 4:24 FEMALE:  Oh nice.  
4:26 4:26 MALE:  It's not as flat as you think. 
4:26 4:26 FEMALE:  So you have the scars to show?  [laughter]
4:27 4:27 MALE:  Yeah, nice to meet you. 
4:28 4:31 FEMALE:  It was nice to meet you.
