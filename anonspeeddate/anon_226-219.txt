0:48 0:50 MALE:  I tend -- I have a lot of friends -- I have a couple friends in the business school.
0:51 0:54 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah, well, you can have outside people because it's very much like a bubble.  
0:54 0:55 MALE:  Is that what it is?
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  Oh, it's ridiculous.
0:56 0:57 MALE:  You -- okay.  [laughter].
0:57 1:04 FEMALE:  No, I mean you -- it's sort of justified right, because we're obviously not there for education, we're there for networking and social reasons.
1:04 1:04 MALE:  Right.
1:04 1:09 FEMALE:  And so they do everything to make sure you know, we're interacting with each other all the time.
1:09 1:10 MALE:    Which is overly -
1:10 1:20 FEMALE:  No, I mean, which I love it, but you just don't ever -- like all your time is occupied by business school students, so you never, ever get to outside of it, unless you sign up for something like that.
1:20 1:24 MALE:  So, so [unintelligible] thing.  
1:24 1:25 FEMALE:  I mean, I love it.
1:25 1:25 MALE:  Oh, you do.
1:25 1:27 FEMALE:  I'm totally drinking the Kool Aid.
1:27 1:30 MALE:  Oh, you are.  I didn't know if you were, you know.
1:30 1:35 FEMALE:  No, no, I totally love it, but it's sort of you're starting to like -- yeah, the first four months you're just totally you know, into it -
1:35 1:35 MALE:  Right.  
1:36 1:45 FEMALE:  And then your finally starting to get your life back.  You're like oh, I used to have outside friends, and they're no longer speaking to me because ever since I moved away -
1:45 1:45 MALE:  Right.  
1:45 1:48 FEMALE:  Became too cool.  [laughter].  
1:48 1:50 MALE:  Well, you know at the GSB, we uh -
1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  
1:52 1:53 MALE:    So what do you do for fun in general?
1:53 1:57 FEMALE:  Uh, for fun, do the bubble thing, so.  I live at Schwab.
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Okay.  
1:58 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, so it's like very much somebody brings a bunch of beer [unintelligible] in the courtyard, you know, six hours later, you know, you're dancing on a table.  The next night you're trying to recover, so, it's the usual. [laughter].
2:11 2:14 MALE:  That sounds like a lot of fun, though.    
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, so, are you at Rains or no?
2:16 2:17 MALE:  I live in [unintelligible] actually.  
2:17 2:17 FEMALE:  Oh, where's that?
2:18 2:20 MALE:  Do you know where the golf course is?
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:20 2:21 MALE:  The range.  
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
2:21 2:23 MALE:  Like right around the corner.  
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Oh, nice.  
2:23 2:24 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:24 2:26 FEMALE:  How'd you score that one?  
2:26 2:27 MALE:  Actually I don't play golf.
2:28 2:28 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:28 2:30 MALE:  Golf is kind of, I don't know, I never got into golf.  Are you a big golfer?
2:31 2:33 FEMALE:  Um, no, but I took beginners golf first quarter.
2:33 2:34 MALE:  You kind of have to here.
2:35 2:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:35 2:38 MALE:  I feel like if you don't use the golf course it's a waste of a resource.  
2:38 2:41 FEMALE:  Exactly, thank you.  Then you might as well not go to Stanford, right?  Might as well go to Harvard.  
2:41 2:43 MALE:  What the hell.  What's important is important here.
