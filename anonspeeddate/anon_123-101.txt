0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  Are you--do you [unintelligible]?
0:11 0:12 MALE:	 No, no, no.
0:15 0:15 FEMALE:  Hi.  
0:16 0:16 MALE:	 male101.
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  female123.
0:16 0:17 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you too.
0:19 0:19 MALE:  How's it going?
0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  Good.  Are you having fun so far?
0:22 0:23 MALE:  Yeah.  Uh, it's an experience.
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  I've never done this before.  Have you?
0:25 0:26 MALE:  Uh, I've never done [unintelligible].
0:28 0:28 FEMALE: [laughter] How did you decide to do this?
0:30 0:34 MALE:  Well I mean, I just, I mean, I saw the email, and I thought, you know, why not?  So...
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  How long have you been at Stanford?
0:37 0:41 MALE:  Well I've been at Stanford--I've been--well I went here for uh college too.
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  Oh you did?
0:42 0:45 MALE: So I've been here for uh--I'm getting my PHD, so I've been here for nine years.
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  What program are you in?
0:47 0:48 MALE:  I'm in engineering?
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  Oh how's that going?  
0:50 0:50 MALE:  Good.
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  What kind of engineering?
0:51 0:51 MALE:  Materials.
0:52 0:54 FEMALE:  What is materials engineering?
0:55 1:07 MALE:  It's um it's really, really broad.  So uh, you know, some people work on more on sort of mechanical engineering side of things.  Some people work more on biology or chemistry side of things.  I'm more electrical engineering [unintelligible].
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  And what do you do?
1:11 1:14 MALE:  I [unintelligible], I'm more physics.  [unintelligible].
1:14 1:21 FEMALE:  What do people do with that?  I never understood why people get doctorates in engineering.  Is it so that you can teach?  Or is it so you can do more high level sort of engineering stuff?
1:23 1:36 MALE:  It's um, well not everybody who gets a PHD teaches [unintelligible] stuff.  I mean, I think--there's a lot of reasons why I do it.  It's a lot more laid back than having a job, right?
1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  Right.
1:36 1:46 MALE:  'Cause you're in school while you're doing your [unintelligible] so. You don't have the same pressures as you do in a job.  You don't get paid as much, but it's more laid back.  And I guess it gives you time to, like, figure out what you want to do.
1:47 1:51 FEMALE:  Oh that's interesting.  Can I ask you a question that I've always wondered about?
1:51 1:51 MALE:  Sure.
1:52 1:57 FEMALE:  I don't if you know the answer.  How in the world, when people build bridges over water, how do they get the--
1:59 2:00 MALE:  You're going to have to ask a civil engineer that.
2:01 2:03 FEMALE:  Oh so, you wouldn't know the answer to that?
2:02 2:03 MALE:  No, I would not know the answer to that.  
2:03 2:15 FEMALE:  I've always wondered that, and I don't really have any--I mean, I'm a humanities person, so I've never really had any--and you know, this is sort of the things that humanities people get around and, like, talk about is, how do these things actually work?
2:16 2:19 MALE:  Yeah.  You'd have to ask a civil engineer.  A civil engineer would [unintelligible].
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  There you go.
2:22 2:23 MALE:  So which uh, which program you in?
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Law.
2:24 2:24 MALE:  Law?
2:24 2:27 FEMALE:  First year.  Yeah.
2:27 2:27 MALE:  You like it?
2:31 2:49 FEMALE:  So I thought it was going to be awful.   I mean, people talk about how law school is awful.  There's all those movies made and all that stuff.  And it's really not bad at all.  It's really not that bad.  Um, I hesitate because I have finals in two weeks, so this is probably not the best time to be asking me whether I like law school.  But it's not bad.
2:49 2:51 MALE:  Okay.  So you guys are done before [unintelligible].
2:52 3:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, one semester.  So we start in September, like, a month before you guys do.  And then we're--my last final should be May 13th or something like that?  Well we finish like a month before you guys do.  Yeah.  And then we go off to our little summer jobs, fighting for justice, or, you know, being a corporate whore, whatever it is that we're doing.  So it should be good.
3:13 3:13 MALE:  Do you have a summer job?
3:14 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Um, I'm working for a law firm in Cleveland.
3:18 3:19 MALE:  Is it--are you from Cleveland?
3:19 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I promised [unintelligible] I'd come home for the summer.  So I was kind of thinking at all--I mean, I did my round of interviews in January, and all these corporations, you know, the law firms seem exactly the same.  And then, I met this guy; he seemed pretty cool.  They're all pretty conservative, especially in Ohio, and he's like, "Oh yeah.  We were retained by the Kerry/Edwards campaign."  I'm like, "Really?"  He's like, "Yeah."  I was like, "Okay.  I want to work with you guys."
3:45 3:45 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:46 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I met a lot of conservative people.  I met--I interviewed at a law firm that was retained by the Bush/Chaney campaign.  I was like, I cannot work for that law firm.  So I'm sorry.  Are you liberal or conservative or...
3:59 4:04 MALE:  I [unintelligible] more conservative than [unintelligible].
4:04 4:05 FEMALE:  That's the [unintelligible] light, though.
