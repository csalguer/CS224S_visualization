0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hi.

0:05 0:05 MALE:  My name's male118.

0:02 0:04 FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female137.  It's nice to meet you.

0:07 0:07 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  We've made it to the end.

0:10 0:11 MALE:  [unintelligible] this is the last one?

0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  It is the last one.

0:12 0:12 MALE:  Oh--

0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  So--

0:13 0:13 MALE:  --I'm heartbroken.

0:10 0:13 FEMALE:  Oh, you've had the chance to meet 19 fabulous ladies.

0:18 0:18 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:14 0:17 FEMALE:  So you--you can't complain about the evening. [laughter]

0:21 0:24 MALE:  Yeah, you better--you better make it [unintelligible] for me right here.

0:21 0:24 FEMALE:  I'm here, what do you want to know.  [laughter]

0:25 0:25 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Well, have you had fun with this?

0:29 0:31 MALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] I've--

0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:31 0:32 MALE:  --enjoyed talking to all the people.

0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:33 0:33 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:34 0:35 MALE:  [unintelligible] I've never done it before.

0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:36 0:40 MALE:  So it's definitely [unintelligible] 

0:37 0:43 FEMALE:  It's great.  I--I think probably the best part of it is that you--I don't know what--what department are you in?

0:47 0:49 MALE:  Uh, [unintelligible] 

0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  Oh, you're a rocket scientist.

0:50 0:50 MALE:  Yeah.

0:47 0:57 FEMALE:  Very cool.  Um, but so you probably live in like your little engineering bubble and we live in our little education bubble and we kind of forget that there are all these like really cool and interesting people out there.

1:00 1:00 MALE:  Yeah.

0:58 1:05 FEMALE:  And so this is neat because if nothing else, we're like at least reminded that life exists outside of the school of education.  [laughter]

1:08 1:10 MALE:  Yeah.  Well I was just talking to her about the--

1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:10 1:10 MALE:  --exact same thing.  

1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:11 1:20 MALE:  And she's like the culture of the school is just like all [unintelligible] really isolated from each other [unintelligible] 

1:17 1:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, which is hilarious though because everyone clearly wants to get out and be meeting people.

1:24 1:25 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.

1:22 1:26 FEMALE:  And there's just--there's really--they keep saying, oh once the graduate student centers open and everything like that--

1:29 1:29 MALE:  Yeah.

1:27 1:40 FEMALE:  --but it's like, um, okay, well right now we can sit on the couch and bring our own food and drinks and entertainment and stuff like that.  It's like, you know, it's going to be fabulous once it's finally open but [laughter].

1:43 1:44 MALE:  Hopefully.

1:41 1:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So are you in the first year of your program then?

1:47 1:47 MALE:  Yeah, the first year.

1:45 1:48 FEMALE:  Okay.  Okay.  And so are you gonna be a space man or?  [laughter]

1:52 1:57 MALE:  Um, I don't know.  I definitely have not put any thought into trying to be an astronaut [unintelligible] 

1:54 1:55 FEMALE:  [laughter] going to the moon--

1:57 2:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] pretty rigorous and I do think that--

1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:02 2:07 MALE:  --I am probably restricted from being an astronaut because I'm too tall.

2:05 2:05 FEMALE:  Oh.

2:08 2:09 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:07 2:07 FEMALE:  Oh.

2:10 2:11 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:08 2:08 FEMALE:  Uh--

2:12 2:15 MALE:  They're probably pretty strict [unintelligible] 

2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.  That's--

2:16 2:16 MALE:  So--

2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:17 2:19 MALE:  [unintelligible] but [unintelligible] 

2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:20 2:21 MALE:  But I don't know [unintelligible] 

2:19 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I have a funny story about--uh, my former roommate's girlfriend was in the program last year.

2:28 2:29 MALE:  All right.

2:26 2:58 FEMALE:  And so when I was living with Daniel and his girlfriend would come over and everything I just remember having some sort of conversation and saying something about, well it's not rocket scientist.  And she kind of looked and she's like, well, actually it is.  And so that was kind of my funny thing because now I actually know people that you can call.  [laughter]  Anyway so and--and, um, [unintelligible] I meet another guy who was in the aero astro program and, um, it was right around the time that they were launching something--oh, it was when something was being launched out in like Arizona.

3:02 3:02 MALE:  All right.

2:59 3:15 FEMALE:  And so I was telling my mom that I had met these people and everything.  And she's like, are they gonna go watch this particular thing and I'm like, it's not like the entire world is like [laughter] convene when like something exciting happens.  It was like a satellite land--didn't like a satellite land or some--I don't know.

3:18 3:20 MALE:  There's stuff happening all the time.

3:17 3:19 FEMALE:  Exactly.  Exactly.

3:22 3:26 MALE:  The big news is the Space Ship 1:  I don't know if you read or heard--

3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

3:26 3:29 MALE:  --[unintelligible] 

3:28 3:33 FEMALE:  Yes.  That was the one that like went into the other--like one of the spheres right?

3:36 3:38 MALE:  Where it's like private [unintelligible] 

3:35 3:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:39 3:40 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:37 3:37 FEMALE:  Yes.  

3:41 3:43 MALE:  So that I could see a lot of people [unintelligible] 

3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:43 3:44 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:41 3:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:45 3:46 MALE:  --to watch it land.

3:43 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't think it was that though.

3:47 3:47 MALE:  Yeah.

3:44 3:46 FEMALE:  I think like a--a satellite was crashing--

3:49 3:49 MALE:  Yeah.

3:46 3:55 FEMALE:  --or something bizarre.  And my mom's like, well are they gonna go watch it?  And I'm like, they live in California, mom, what are you talking about?  But--anyway, well I hope this--

3:57 3:58 MALE:  [unintelligible] it's over?

3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  I hope this was a good conclusion for you.

4:00 4:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] it met my expectations.

3:59 4:04 FEMALE:  Oh, good, I'm glad that it met your expectations.  But--oh.
