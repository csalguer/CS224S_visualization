0:03 0:03 MALE:  Hi.
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:05 0:05 MALE:  I'm male111.
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  female122.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.
0:09 0:09 MALE:  How's it going?
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  Going okay.
0:11 0:12 MALE:  [unintelligible] yet.
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  It's going by so fast.
0:14 0:18 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Nice talking about myself as much or at the sound of a horn.
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:22 0:23 MALE:  Which program are you in?
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Genetics.
0:25 0:27 MALE:  Is that part of the Biology department?
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:28 0:28 MALE:  Okay.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  We're in School of Med, [unintelligible].
0:31 0:34 MALE:  Oh cool.  Does the Ph.D. [unintelligible]?
0:35 0:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm in the Ph.D. program, my first year.
0:38 0:39 MALE:  Okay.  How do you like it so far?
0:40 0:43 FEMALE:  I'm liking it.  Still trying to decide where my interests are.
0:44 0:44 MALE:  Yeah.
0:45 0:48 FEMALE:  We have class here, but not too much work thankfully.
0:49 0:52 MALE:  That's nice.  You guys have worked hard here, you've earned your quarter off [unintelligible].
0:52 0:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:53 0:58 MALE:  Yeah, I'm not [unintelligible] to talk about what would be good [unintelligible].
0:59 1:01 FEMALE:  I would be curious to decide what lab I want to join.
1:01 1:04 MALE:  Okay.  And that's what they determine what you end up doing here right?
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, a lot of pressure.
1:06 1:06 MALE:  How are you going to decide?
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  I don't know yet.  I keep going back and forth.
1:10 1:12 MALE:  Is it between two choices or is it sort of --
1:13 1:24 FEMALE:  So we do three rotations the three quarters.  So this is the third lab I've been in.  There are two labs I really like and they're very different.  I'm not sure how I'm going to pick.
1:26 1:30 MALE:  Does this determine the people you want to be with or just more procurely what are they doing?
1:31 1:39 FEMALE:  Well it's all three.  You know good PI, good people in the lab and interested in research.  You need all three.
1:40 1:42 MALE:  Right, to make it [unintelligible] yeah.
1:43 1:47 FEMALE:  And you'll be with the people for four years.  So I have two good choices.  But now I'm deciding really what I want to do.
1:47 1:48 MALE:  What's the deadline?
1:49 1:53 FEMALE:  Well, we have to decide by September, but they want you to decide in June.
1:54 1:58 MALE:  Right, wow.  Good luck with that.  Oh my gosh.  That's a wealth of good choices, it seems like.
1:58 2:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Definitely.  It's exciting.  I mean once I decide, it will be fine.
2:04 2:22 MALE:  Right, right.  I'm sure its like just once it's done, you'll feel like you can breathe easier and it won't be nearly as stressful.  Yeah, I'm in Social Science so we don't really have like labs to choose from.  We're kind of more like we have an advisor to choose, but we don't really choose that.  [unintelligible]  They're like you're working for me for the next couple years.
2:22 2:24 FEMALE:  Have you been doing Masters or are you Ph.D.?
2:24 2:27 MALE:  Yeah, I'm Ph.D.  There isn't a Masters Program where they finish it out.
2:27 2:27 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:28 2:29 MALE:  When you leave the program, you probably get a Masters.
2:30 2:32 FEMALE:  Ours is the same way.  They say it's your [unintelligible].
2:32 2:57 MALE:  Yeah, it's kind of like, you can actually file for one, but you don't actually [unintelligible].  But it's nice.  I'm in like my third year now and I think it gets easier with each passing year.  I don't know if it's because I've gotten better at it or probably not.  Probably the actual course has gotten a little bit easier I think.  But I do really like it.  Like the people are really great.  It's a very small type of community.  We're all in the same building and it's really nice.
2:59 3:03 FEMALE:  You're working with a professor?  You have like an office?  I mean it's not a lab.
3:03 3:27 MALE:  No [unintelligible].  No machines like that.  Yeah, you have an office.  You work with a professor.  You share an office with a grad student.  Like it's very like nice.  And professors try to have like a lab like professional feel where like you get some people working on the same projects or what not.  So there's actually one lab, well a lab is just a bunch of people working on a bunch of computers.  Not a real lab you know.
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Its computer research?
3:31 4:00 MALE:  Yes.  They may work as statistical.  Like getting data and sort of like running with data and stuff.  What's nice is [unintelligible] people are in history and politics, economics, all kind of come together.  It is like largely work as sort of data, but get data from all kinds of interesting sources like archives and newspaper records and that kind of thing.  So I like it.  You can have scientific skills but still have [unintelligible].  I like it.  I like it.  Are you from around here?
4:01 4:01 FEMALE:  Colorado.
4:02 4:02 MALE:  Where in Colorado?
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Colorado Springs.
4:03 4:04 MALE:  So you're a skier?
4:05 4:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, actually.  Not everyone is.
4:07 4:09 MALE:  Have you been to Tahoe at all this year?
4:09 4:11 FEMALE:  I haven't been skiing at all this year.
4:11 4:14 MALE:  Oh wow.  Is it because of work or just because [unintelligible] doesn't compare to Colorado?
4:15 4:17 FEMALE:  I haven't been.  That's too far of a drive.
4:17 4:20 MALE:  Oh my gosh.  You should totally make the drive.  It's worth it.
4:21 4:22 FEMALE:  I know.  I guess I'm spoiled.
4:22 4:25 MALE:  Its three and a half hours.  You should definitely go.
4:25 4:26 FEMALE:  One or two hours.
4:26 4:30 MALE:  Yeah, it's really great, though.  [unintelligible].  It's nice in Colorado.
4:31 4:33 FEMALE:  Well, I like it there, but not this year.
4:33 4:34 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
4:34 4:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:35 4:35 MALE:  Take care.
