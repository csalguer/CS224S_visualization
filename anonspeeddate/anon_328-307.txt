0:00 0:13 FEMALE:  Oh shoot.  male307.
0:04 0:06 MALE:  What's up?  What do you want to talk about?
0:16 0:18 FEMALE:  [laughter].  My--
0:09 0:11 MALE:  [interposing] What station are we at?  Let's start there.
0:20 0:22 FEMALE:  H.  Um--
0:14 0:15 MALE:  [interposing] So can I divert our conversation?
0:25 0:25 FEMALE:  Absolutely.
0:17 0:23 MALE:  So one of the thing--you weren't at, yeah, Monday's STG [phonetic], but I think there was an area that I need help with that you could be extraordinarily helpful.
0:33 0:33 FEMALE:  Sure.
0:24 0:30 MALE:  And that is that of um--what I'm finding is that I'm not great at time management.
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:31 0:33 MALE:  And so I'm now am I false in--
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh, no, no.
0:34 0:35 MALE:  --assuming that you are?
0:44 0:48 FEMALE:  I--I--I've gotten good feedback on that, so I just find--
0:40 0:41 MALE:  [interposing] Thought you were good in time management?
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:41 0:48 MALE:  Oh good.  Um so I'm now working in this business plan with nameX, and uh, you know, there's so much to do.
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:48 0:53 MALE:  And so what happens to me is like I'll--I'll go down one path trying to get something done, and then I'll get distracted--
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
0:54 0:56 MALE:  --and end up on a tangent.  And then like do all these little things--
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
0:56 0:57 MALE:  --and suddenly it's 2:00 in the morning, and I got to go to bed.
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:58 1:02 MALE:  And I'm like shoot, I didn't get done the stuff I needed to get done.
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:03 1:10 MALE:  Like um--so how do you keep A, like your long term goals and B, like get done what you need to get done--
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
1:11 1:16 MALE:  --and not get distracted and--like what organizational tools do you use in your life that help you?
1:25 1:28 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Do you--do you always ask these questions on a date?
1:20 1:23 MALE:  I--I asked you if I may divert the conversation.  You can say no.
1:32 1:37 FEMALE:  Um yeah, I'm not--so I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask about that kind of time management.
1:28 1:28 MALE:  Okay.  Fair enough.
1:37 1:41 FEMALE:  Um I'm--I think I'm pretty good at--at managing time in a meeting.
1:33 1:33 MALE:  Okay.
1:42 1:45 FEMALE:  But, I mean, I can tell you what I try to do which is not necessarily what I really do.
1:37 1:41 MALE:  I perceive you as very organized and good at time management.  Am I false in that?  
1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:42 1:42 MALE:  Am I incorrect?
1:51 1:59 FEMALE:  Uh, I wish I were--I wish I were better.  Um but what I try to do is--is--is keep clear in my head what are the things I have to do and like write them down.
1:50 1:50 MALE:  Yeah.
1:59 2:08 FEMALE:  And I'm much better at like if I write them down first and kind of in two columns of like these are the kind of meta [phonetic] things that have to get done, and here are some of the little things that have to get done.
1:59 2:01 MALE:  You actually do that?  So you have two different columns.
2:10 2:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:02 2:03 MALE:  Is this on a piece of paper or a notebook uh?
2:12 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, usually.  Yeah.  I found, for whatever reason, if I put it into Outlook To-Do's, it'll never happen.  [laughter].  I don't know.  But that--and--
2:12 2:12 MALE:  [interposing] Okay.
2:21 2:34 FEMALE:  --if--if I've got like a week with exams and I'm just totally pressed, I will literally schedule out, in Excel, like every half hour period to make sure--like if I know that a paper's going to take me like four hours--
2:25 2:25 MALE:  [interposing] And then you stick to it--
2:35 2:36 FEMALE:  [interposing] I stick to it as much as I can.
2:27 2:27 MALE:  --basically
2:36 2:42 FEMALE:  And I try to put it--but I try to put in time for like this is when I'm going to lunch, like hour and-a-half.
2:33 2:33 MALE:  Yeah.
2:43 2:45 FEMALE:  And like it's going to take me a half hour to get there, half hour to get back.
2:37 2:39 MALE:  And you do it--you take the time first to do the scheduling.
2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  Usually when I'm sitting in a class.
2:41 2:42 MALE:  I think that's what I'm missing.  Oh, okay.  But you do it.
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:45 2:45 MALE:  Yeah.
2:55 2:56 FEMALE:  And I--I find that really helps.  
2:47 2:47 MALE:  Okay.
2:57 3:09 FEMALE:  It also--I find it really works well is I'm doing things with people, not necessarily all--all working in a room.  But like if I--if I say to one of my teammates, like on a--on our 356, we're going to--
3:00 3:00 MALE:  [interposing] For [unintelligible]--
3:09 3:12 FEMALE:  --yeah, let's meet on Friday, and we'll talk about this stuff.
3:03 3:05 MALE:  Right.  So the deadline clears up.
3:14 3:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:05 3:06 MALE:  Okay.  That's helpful.
3:15 3:15 FEMALE:  [laughter].
3:07 3:08 MALE:  Sorry.  I just want to know.
3:18 3:18 FEMALE:  No, that's--
3:09 3:15 MALE:  Take--use--use the time uh well and I've been wanting to ask you that 'cause you weren't at STG on Monday.
3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  I think it's funny that you asked me.  [laughter].  Was that something that you guys talked about?
3:18 3:21 MALE:  Yes.  Well, we talked about our goals--
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
3:21 3:24 MALE:  --and that's one of my big goals that's kind of stressing me out right now because--
3:33 3:33 FEMALE:  [interposing] Wow.
3:24 3:29 MALE:  --I feel like I'm not as effective as I want to be at getting stuff done, and that kind of worries me a little bit.
3:38 3:38 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:30 3:30 MALE:  So I'm--
3:40 3:44 FEMALE:  [interposing] But I think in a team, you're really--like when you were our task leader, I thought you were extremely effective.
3:36 3:36 MALE:  Thank you.
3:45 3:45 FEMALE:  So.
3:37 3:42 MALE:  That's a good.  Um so I'll just have to hire some people and have a team to manage.
3:52 3:55 FEMALE:  That's--that's nameX's perspective.  He's a terrible time manager.
3:46 3:46 MALE:  Who?  nameX--
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  [interposing] nameX [phonetic].
3:48 3:48 MALE:  nameX who?
3:57 3:59 FEMALE:  Augenbraun.  He's um--
3:51 3:52 MALE:  [interposing] Damn it.  Oh, we'll talk later.
4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:53 3:54 MALE:  Um okay.
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Call me.
3:55 3:55 MALE:  Thank you.
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Sure.  I think--
3:58 3:58 MALE:  [interposing] Oh, so I'm moving and you're staying.
4:08 4:08 FEMALE:  I think you move.  Yup.
4:00 4:00 MALE:  Have fun.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  Good luck.  Happy hunting.  [laughter].
