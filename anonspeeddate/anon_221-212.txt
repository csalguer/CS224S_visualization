1:00 1:08 FEMALE: Can't complain.  You know, Stanford's great.  Um, I'll be for awhile, like five to X years, however long it takes for me to finish my dissertation.

1:04 1:07 MALE: So like what area of like Russian literature do you focus in then, or...?

1:11 1:17 FEMALE: I'm not sure yet, I think I'm probably going to do modern stuff, and I'm really interested in a regional focus on the Far East.

1:13 1:14 MALE: Oh.  

1:18 1:30 FEMALE: Maybe - I might start taking Japanese next year, kind of explore how Asian philosophy, religion, has influenced Russian literature, if at all.  And I have to do some reading this summer to see if that's a possibility.

1:26 1:27 MALE: Interesting.  Yeah, I was in Japan last summer.

1:33 1:33 FEMALE: Oh, really?

1:30 1:32 MALE: Actually, for -- before I came to -- to the grad.

1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Doing what?

1:33 1:43 MALE:  Um, teaching -- it was a program with the rotary, so I spent like two-thirds of my time teaching English in schools, and one-third sort of exploring traditional Japanese crafts, and like tourist sights and things, so -

1:45 1:46 FEMALE: Interesting.

1:44 1:45 MALE: - it was pretty cool.  

1:47 1:47 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:46 1:53 MALE: I took an undergrad course in like the Japanese tea ceremony.  It's one of those things that changes your world view and so -

1:54 1:55 FEMALE: How did it change your world view?

1:54 2:03 MALE: Well, I mean it sort of -- it like, the whole Zen aspect of it, and like how like your traditions between host and guest, and I don't know if you're familiar with -

2:04 2:05 FEMALE: I'm familiar with Zen.

2:04 2:05 MALE: Yeah.

2:06 2:09 FEMALE: Yeah, but I haven't really learned much about tea ceremonies, so...

2:07 2:12 MALE: Well, San Francisco is home to the U.S. headquarters of the tea ceremony, like, school and -

2:14 2:14 FEMALE: Wow.

2:13 2:14 MALE: - whatever.

2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  Interesting.

2:18 2:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  Where are you from originally?

2:20 2:23 MALE: Champagne, Illinois.  It's been pretty nice out here, you know.

2:23 2:23 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:25 2:27 FEMALE: Yeah.  Which is good, I'm glad.

2:29 2:30 FEMALE: I'm from Portland, Oregon.

2:31 2:31 MALE: Okay.

2:30 2:33 FEMALE: So it's not too far.  It's really nice to be close to home, actually.

2:34 2:37 MALE: Yeah, I spent a week in Portland in high school, actually.

2:36 2:36 FEMALE: What did you think?

2:38 2:42 MALE: It was okay.  It rained like every day except the last one.

2:40 2:40 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.

2:43 2:50 MALE: But I understand you have like beautiful rose gardens and it was almost in bloom on the river.

2:47 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  It's a beautiful city, you know, it just takes that much rain to make it as beautiful as it is.

2:54 2:55 MALE: Yeah.

2:52 2:53 FEMALE: So you just have to live it.

2:56 2:58 MALE: Yeah, there's so many plants that need water and stuff.

2:55 2:56 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.

2:59 3:02 MALE: It was a nice area, and plus no sales tax.

2:59 3:10 FEMALE: Yes, that's true.  I forget that that's like a really big bonus for people, because I grew up with it, so it doesn't seem, you know, it just seems like a real burden to come somewhere else where it's in effect.  So what do you like to do in your free time?

3:13 3:25 MALE: In my free time, I guess basically, you know, when I'm not -- random Japanese stuff, but I do like a lot of concerts, you know, museums, that type of stuff.  Like this quarter, I'm in a French cooking class.

3:22 3:22 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

3:26 3:30 MALE: And I do sailing and golf this quarter.  I did social dancing in the past.

3:26 3:26 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

3:31 3:37 MALE: But this quarter didn't quite work out as well as I had planned, so I, you know, let that slide by the wayside, but...

3:32 3:33 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.  Cool.

3:38 3:40 MALE: But it's pretty cool.  Like what sort of things do you do in you're not reading Russian literature?

3:35 3:47 FEMALE: I don't know, just like spend time with friends, hang out in coffee shops, um, I live in Escondido village, and Bay [phonetic] are a lot of -- really fun, just random events.  I like to go on those, 'cause it's cheap and.

3:52 3:53 MALE: In one of the condos or the studios?

3:48 3:49 FEMALE: Uh, in a studio.

3:54 3:55 MALE: Oh, which one?  I'm in three.
