1:58 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, so, I'm going to be a litigator which means that, kind of like the ones that you see on TV, like the people who get up and argue.  That's what litigators do [laughter].
2:04 2:07 MALE:  Right, oh wow.  Did you practice debate in high school?
2:08 2:12 FEMALE:  Um, no actually I didn't.  I did speech because missed speech and debate and [unintelligible].

2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  They're like two branches of the same thing so.
2:14 2:15 MALE:  Right.
2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  [Inaudible].

2:20 2:21 FEMALE:  Oh, awesome, awesome.
2:22 2:30 MALE:  My partner and I weren't the best debaters [laughter].  But I mean we had, we, we were having a lot of fun.
2:30 3:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, I know, I mean, that's what high schools all about.  Like I think high school these days like there's way too much pressure on kids to like [laughter] do these like amazing things.  And you're only like 16 years old; you're just like, um.  Yeah, um, that's not really realistic um, but I mean I guess it's like the drive to get into a good college like [laughter].  It's kind of sad really because the high school that I went to was like a, a competitive one and um, after I left actually they had this cheating scandal.  And usually when you think of people cheating you think that it's, you know people who are like, getting F's and you just want to get a C.  But like, it's actually like kids who were getting B's who were changing their grades to A's.  And so it's just like, you know what does that say, you know [laughter].

3:19 3:25 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was in high school and there was a lot of cheating too.  It's, it was competitive and people always wanted the edge.
