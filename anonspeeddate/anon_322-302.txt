0:01:01.4 0:01:02.6 MALE:  Oh, okay, yeah, so- 
0:01:03.0 0:01:06.3 FEMALE:  -we had an art course and a culture course and, you know. 
0:01:04.5 0:01:06.1 MALE:  In what- you- in what department are you? 
0:01:08.2 0:01:09.9 FEMALE:  Oh, I'm in the School of Education.  
0:01:08.8 0:01:09.3 MALE:  Oh, okay. 
0:01:10.6 0:01:11.4 FEMALE:  How about you?  
0:01:09.9 0:01:11.0 MALE:  Uh, physics. 
0:01:12.5 0:01:13.2 FEMALE:  Oh, cool. 
0:01:11.7 0:01:18.1 MALE:  But, so you said you have- you had class in, uh, art and French, and- even though you were at the school of education? 
0:01:19.2 0:01:21.6 FEMALE:  Oh, no, no, no.  This is when I was an undergrad student. 
0:01:19.7 0:01:20.6 MALE:  Oh, okay so you're-

0:01:24.6 0:01:28.7 FEMALE:  -in the school of education, but undergrad I did, uh, I had a mathematics degree. 
0:01:27.9 0:01:28.7 MALE:  Mathematics? 
0:01:29.9 0:01:30.3 FEMALE:  Uh-huh. 
0:01:28.9 0:01:29.5 MALE:  Okay. 
0:01:30.7 0:01:31.2 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:01:29.6 0:01:32.5 MALE:  That's a complete change, no?  Between math and-
0:01:33.3 0:01:36.2 FEMALE:  Well, I wanted- I- I'm interested in teaching mathematics- 
0:01:34.5 0:01:36.1 MALE:  Okay, so that's [unintelligible] change. 
0:01:36.1 0:01:39.6 FEMALE:  -and math education.  So, yeah.  How about you? 
0:01:38.7 0:01:42.2 MALE:  Uh, currently, I'm actually in post-doc in the physics department. 
0:01:43.6 0:01:44.2 FEMALE:  Oh, cool. 
0:01:43.1 0:01:48.3 MALE:  And, uh, what can I say?  I just do research in the solar physics. 
0:01:50.0 0:01:50.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh. 
0:01:49.7 0:01:50.7 MALE:  That's interesting. 
0:01:52.3 0:01:57.6 FEMALE:  So, did you take your- did you do your undergraduate degree in Paris, in France? 
0:01:55.6 0:02:03.0 MALE:  Not in Paris.  Yeah, in France.  I, uh, passed my PhD in Paris and then I came here just after.  So- 
0:02:00.8 0:02:07.3 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Wow.  So is this, are you in your first year here at Stanford, or-
0:02:06.0 0:02:06.4 MALE:  What? 
0:02:07.8 0:02:09.7 FEMALE:  Are you in your first year here at Stanford? 
0:02:08.2 0:02:10.2 MALE:  Uh, I am, second- second year. 
0:02:11.6 0:02:13.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  How do you like it? 
0:02:12.1 0:02:13.6 MALE:  Uh, it's a lot of fun.  
0:02:15.0 0:02:15.4 FEMALE:  Yeah?

0:02:16.1 0:02:16.7 FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:02:16.0 0:02:18.2 MALE:  The weather is nice, the campus is gorgeous.  
0:02:19.4 0:02:19.8 FEMALE:  Right. 
0:02:18.2 0:02:20.9 MALE:  We don't have this- well, you have seen the campus we have in Paris. 
0:02:22.7 0:02:23.3 FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:02:21.3 0:02:23.6 MALE:  A really rusty campus.  We are not that, uh-
0:02:24.9 0:02:26.9 FEMALE:  It's not as nice as this one [laughter]. 
0:02:24.2 0:02:29.1 MALE:  Yeah, [laughter] there is nothing compare- uh, comparable to, uh, Stanford, and so, uh- 
0:02:29.8 0:02:31.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
0:02:29.4 0:02:30.3 MALE:  I really like it. 
0:02:32.3 0:02:32.8 FEMALE:  That's great. 
0:02:31.5 0:02:39.6 MALE:  For us, it's good to pass your PhD in France and then go to, uh, the US because in France education is free basically, so you don't have to pay. 
0:02:40.5 0:02:42.9 FEMALE:  We have it all messed up here, we don't have it right. 
0:02:41.5 0:02:42.2 MALE: Yeah. 
0:02:43.2 0:02:45.7 FEMALE:  You guys have it right over there [laughter]. 
0:02:44.0 0:02:47.6 MALE:  I don't pay anything for the PhD and then I do work at Stanford.  It's good stuff. 
0:02:48.2 0:02:55.1 FEMALE:  Wow, yeah.  That is good stuff.  So are you going stay out here in California afterwards, or-
0:02:53.1 0:02:55.4 MALE:  Uh, I- I- I like- I would like to, yeah. 
0:02:56.6 0:02:57.1 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:55.3 0:03:00.5 MALE:  So, uh, yeah, and my plan is to stay here and work at Stanford.  But, uh- 
0:03:00.7 0:03:05.3 FEMALE:  Oh, great.  So what in physics do you research? 
0:03:04.2 0:03:05.5 MALE:  Solar ,uh, solar physics. 
0:03:07.0 0:03:07.9 FEMALE:  Solar physics? 
0:03:06.1 0:03:15.4 MALE:  Yeah, I do uh- I do models of the sun.  How the sun- uh, phy- physics- uh, how the entire of the sun works and so how it produce energy and this kind of stuff. 
0:03:14.0 0:03:24.1 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Wow.  So is that- how many other places are working on the same type of research that you are? 
0:03:23.0 0:03:24.1 MALE:  Many people, like- 
0:03:24.7 0:03:29.0 FEMALE:  Like, I, I mean, is what you do, I would think that that's fairly unique? 
0:03:27.9 0:03:33.3 MALE:  Yeah- yeah, not unique, but that's rather- rather specific.  Maybe you are like 20 people in the world. 
0:03:32.4 0:03:35.4 FEMALE:  Right.  Yeah. 
0:03:33.8 0:03:34.8 MALE:  Working on this. 
0:03:36.1 0:03:39.5 FEMALE:  I would call that unique. [laughter]  
0:03:36.1 0:03:40.3 MALE:  Which is cool because if you make a mistake, no one can, uh- no one knows. 
0:03:40.4 0:03:43.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, right that's true.  You can write up all this new research.
0:03:41.5 0:03:42.6 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.
0:03:43.1 0:03:48.2 FEMALE:  And no one will know for a couple years [laughter]. 
0:03:42.7 0:03:48.8 MALE:  You write complete bullshit and they don't realize it for twenty years or the next ten years, you're cool. So, uh-
0:03:48.6 0:03:50.6 FEMALE:  That's very cool. 
0:03:49.3 0:03:50.4 MALE:  That's- that's a nice part.  
0:03:51.7 0:03:52.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:50.8 0:03:56.0 MALE:  And you? Uh, so- so you- how long will it- uh, what's your program?  In semesters, in- 
0:03:57.2 0:03:58.5 FEMALE:  It's actually just one year long.  
0:03:57.5 0:03:57.9 MALE:  Okay.
0:03:58.5 0:04:02.1 FEMALE:  I began last June, and I end this upcoming June. 
0:04:00.7 0:04:05.2 MALE:  Okay, your degree is three years, no?  Or, you- you- you wanted to do it in one year or- 
0:04:06.6 0:04:08.4 FEMALE:  It's usually- I'm sorry, what? 
0:04:07.2 0:04:09.5 MALE:  You wanted to do it in one year or-  
0:04:10.3 0:04:12.9 FEMALE:  No the whole program that I'm in right now is just one year. 
0:04:11.5 0:04:12.0 MALE:  Oh, okay. 
0:04:13.1 0:04:18.9 FEMALE:  Um, so everyone, it's like really compacted and we um- we work really hard and- 
0:04:14.6 0:04:16.1 MALE:   Yeah.  I guess so.
0:04:16.2 0:04:17.1 [horn]
0:04:18.3 0:04:19.3 MALE:  You must have a lot of work.
0:04:19.4 0:04:22.3 FEMALE:  Oh man.  Well it was good to meet you. 
0:04:21.0 0:04:21.5 MALE:  Yeah.
