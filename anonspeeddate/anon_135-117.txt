0:04 0:05 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:07 0:09 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  This is exhausting.  
0:08 0:10 MALE:  I know it is, but--
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  So, what do you do?  
0:11 0:12 MALE:  I'm in the law school.  
0:14 0:14 FEMALE:  Law school?  
0:13 0:14 MALE:  Yeah. What about you?  
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  I'm in the ed school.  
0:15 0:16 MALE:  Ed school, okay.  
0:18 0:18 FEMALE:  Doctoral program.  
0:17 0:22 MALE:  Yeah, that's got to be the most popular one here tonight, the ed school, the ladies at least.  
0:24 0:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  There are like two guys in the ed school total, so.  
0:25 0:34 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  I was in education before, so I remember my ed school program.  And there were no other guys in my program.  It was all girls.  
0:36 0:37 FEMALE:  Where was that?
0:36 0:36 MALE:  It was in Illinois.  
0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  At Urbana/Champagne?  
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  That's where my parents went for graduate school.  
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Oh, really?  
0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  I always feel kind of--yeah.  
0:42 0:43 MALE:  Where are you from?  
0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  I'm from California.  
0:44 0:45 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:47 0:50 FEMALE: Yeah, they finished and came back here.  So...
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Ah, so where did you go for undergrad?  
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Berkley.  
0:50 0:52 MALE:  Okay, so you're a California girl, huh? 
0:55 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, well I was living in Wisconsin for the last like five years, so.  
0:57 0:57 MALE:  Oh, really?
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Why?  
1:00 1:04 FEMALE:  Well, I got a scholarship to go to EW Madison for political science.  
1:02 1:02 MALE:  Okay.  
1:05 1:07 FEMALE:  And I did that for a couple of years, and then I was a lobbyist for a couple of years.  
1:05 1:06 MALE:  What did you lobby for?  
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  AARP.  
1:07 1:08 MALE:  Oh, okay. 
1:10 1:14 FEMALE:  I was the state lobbyist in Wisconsin for the legislature.  
1:12 1:15 MALE:  Okay, so what do you think of that Medicare bill?  
1:18 1:19 FEMALE:  Awful.  
1:17 1:18 MALE: But they supported it didn't they?  
1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  I know.  It was terrible.  
1:20 1:20 MALE:  yeah.  
1:22 1:24 FEMALE:  And I had to be like diplomatic about it.  
1:23 1:23 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:25 1:27 FEMALE:  And, you know, like explain it.  
1:25 1:25 MALE: Yeah.  
1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  You know, but now they regret it.  They know.  
1:28 1:29 MALE: They regret it.  They blew it.  
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, they blew it.  
1:31 1:35 MALE:  Now they're like, no, we're not going for social security crap. We're against it.  
1:37 1:44 FEMALE:  Exactly, thank god.  This is great.  Very few people know AARP issues.  That's pretty impressive.  
1:42 1:42 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:44 1:46 FEMALE:  You must politically like--
1:44 2:12 MALE:  [interposing]  It's probably not good that I know.  It wouldn't [unintelligible] too well.  [laughter]  No, I was into politics way too much until election, and then I just said I'm not paying attention any more.  I give the lightest amount of attention to the news now.  So, I just generally know what's going on, but I was following the election way too closely.  So, then after Bush won, I was a little bit like, okay, got to move on with my life and just realize that's the way it's going to be.  
2:14 2:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, coming back Wednesday like everybody was so--
2:15 2:33 MALE:  [interposing]  I had to go to a really early morning meeting the next day, and I was just like I can't believe it cause I stayed up, you know, like there's got to be some way it could be wrong, you know.  And, uh, it's not a good day on Wednesday, but what can you do?  You've got to move on.  
2:36 2:36 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:35 2:36 MALE:  And find diversions and stuff.  
2:40 2:41 FEMALE: And what kind of law are you interested in?  
2:39 2:43 MALE:  I'm really interested in education/civil rights law. 
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Cool.  
2:44 2:58 MALE:  Kind of combined, but you know I'm interested in public interest law overall.  But I'm going to work at a law firm for a while after I graduate and try to pay down the old loans a little bit.  Then do as much pro bono work as I can while I'm at the firm.  
3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  Do you have a firm already?  
3:00 3:03 MALE:  Yeah, I'm already set up with [unintelligible] in Chicago.  
3:05 3:06 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  
3:05 3:06 MALE:  Going to be working downtown.  
3:09 3:10 FEMALE:  That's kind of exciting.  
3:08 3:29 MALE:  I'm looking forward to it actually.  I lived in Chicago for a few years, and I had two jobs I was deciding between.  One was downtown, and one was out in the suburbs.  And I ended up taking the one out in the suburbs, and I kind of--I always wanted to work downtown for a while.  But I just decided the other job was much better for me.  So, now I finally get to work downtown.  It should be fun. 
3:31 3:34 FEMALE:  Yeah, when I was in Madison I lived right down town, right near [unintelligible].  
3:33 3:33 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:35 3:42 FEMALE:  I kind of miss like I kind of miss being in a downtown where you can walk and, you know, go to bars.  Like everything is real close.  
3:40 3:40 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:43 3:45 FEMALE:  You know, like here you have to drive everywhere.  
3:44 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.  Well, it's funny because when I came out her I just liked how it was kind of quiet and you just drive places, and I could get parking.  And I don't have to deal with all the honking and everything.
3:56 3:56 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:56 4:01 MALE:  Except for that.  Well, it was nice to meet you, female135.  
4:04 4:05 FEMALE:  Good luck.  
4:03 4:03 MALE:  You too.
