0:01 0:13 MALE:  I find.  I thought that was why they were being so spastic about the time--why they're being so tough on the time.  She's worried that times going to run out on us.  It's like come on.  
0:13 0:18 FEMALE:  Well, I imagine they [unintelligible].  They have [unintelligible]. 
0:19 0:26 MALE:  Yeah, I doubt it.  Just a little more time to throw out those things.  Yeah, so--well--
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I'm female128.  
0:26 0:27 MALE:  Well, female128, I'm male117.  
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:28 0:29 MALE:  You too.  
0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  All right.
0:33 0:34 MALE:  So how are things going?
0:35 0:35 FEMALE:  Good, how about you?
0:36 0:36 MALE:  It's going pretty well.  
0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  Cool.
0:37 0:41 MALE:  Yeah, so what are you working on here at Stanford?
0:42 0:44 FEMALE:  I'm doing my PhD in geophysics.  What about yourself?
0:44 0:47 MALE:  Geophysics, ah, I'm working--I have the law school.  
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  What kind of law?  
0:50 0:53 MALE:  Well, I'm interested in education law mostly.  
0:53 0:53 FEMALE:  Oh, really?
0:54 0:56 MALE:  Education/civil rights kind of law. 
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Okay. 
0:57 1:02 MALE:  Which--that's why I kind of came to law school, and that's what I was working on.
1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:03 1:07 MALE:  There was this huge case I was working on, and then it settled unexpectedly last summer.  
1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:09 1:15 MALE:  So, I've been kind of like, okay.  It kind of threw me for a loop because I had a job set up with this law firm to work on this case.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  That means we can start.
1:18 1:22 MALE:  Yeah, okay.  So...
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  What was the case?
1:25 1:43 MALE:  It was basically a--you know, students and parents, but, you know, with like some non-profits.  And this one law firm that was providing all the resources pro bono suing the state because four kids were basically not getting just like simple--
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Here?
1:43 1:44 MALE:    Yeah, suing California.  
1:44 1:44 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:45 2:26 MALE:    Saying, hey, you have to make sure that kids are at least getting like a textbook that's not like 30 years old or just a textbook, any textbook, and just, you know, that the conditions at the schools are just so out--in disrepair and stuff like that.  Saying, hey, it's your job to make sure these school districts that don't have the resources to take care of things, that it's getting taken care of, and then the grey data to see what it's like [unintelligible].  We don't have any responsibility here.  So, it became this big lawsuit, and when Schwarzenegger came in he was like--what, of course, we want to make sure the kids at least have like the basics. 
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:26 2:27 MALE:  So, he settled it.  
2:28 2:29 FEMALE:  Really?  Huh.  
2:29 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, which was good, but that's what I was planning to work on for the next four years.  It's kind of like one of things--okay, it's good, but...
2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  So, are you finishing your degree then? 
2:39 2:40 MALE:  Yeah, I'm finishing up, yeah. 
2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  Wow.  
2:44 2:47 MALE:  Yeah, a few weeks, a month.  Yeah.
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  So, you can't work for that big company you were working for?
2:50 3:06 MALE:  Well, they still offered me a job, but I wasn't quite as excited about it because a big part of it was to work on that case.  But I actually accepted it, and then I had stuff going on this semester where I decided, you know, what I'm going to go back to Chicago, which is where I'm from.  So, I decided to take a job offer there.  
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  Okay.  
3:08 3:08 MALE:  So.  
3:08 3:11 FEMALE:  So, is there a lot of like big law cases?  
3:13 3:19 MALE:  There are actually around the country.  There always seems to be a bunch going on at one time.  
3:20 3:25 FEMALE:  Is it like mostly, I mean, about resources, or is it about [unintelligible]? 
3:26 3:42 MALE:  It's mostly about resources, but there's--like there are lawsuits going on with no child left behind.  There are lawsuits going on about that for different reasons, you know.  Some of the states are suing the federal government saying wait a second, you can't force us to do this.  
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Right.  
3:43 3:57 MALE:  without providing us the money to do it.  Connecticut has one going on.  Now Utah has had something going on there, and then there's one going on--yeah, it might be.  I wonder if it's in Illinois because there's just a--
3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I'm going to tell you [unintelligible]. 
3:58 3:58 MALE:  Really, two days?  
3:59 4:01 FEMALE:  It was [unintelligible].  I don't know.  We don't all [unintelligible].  
4:01 4:01 MALE:  Oh. 
4:02 4:05 FEMALE:  But I thought, well, I might [unintelligible].  
4:05 4:18 MALE:  Because they just filed--there was a new lawsuit that was filed in the Midwest by a bunch of states together, and I haven't--it came out yesterday and I haven't read the article yet.  But, anyway, that's my thing.  
4:18 4:20 FEMALE:  Wow, that's really interesting.  
4:20 4:20 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:22 4:23 FEMALE:  I hadn't thought of that.
4:24 4:24 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:24 4:25 FEMALE:  I never thought of education law.  
4:26 4:27 MALE:  Well, I was a teacher. 
4:28 4:28 FEMALE:  Oh, really?  
4:28 4:30 MALE:  Yeah, I taught elementary school.  
4:31 4:32 FEMALE:  Cool, what grade?  
4:33 4:33 MALE:  Third and fourth.  
4:34 4:34 FEMALE:  For how long?
4:35 4:36 MALE:  I taught for like four years.  
4:37 4:39 FEMALE:  Did you do--did you do the [unintelligible] thing, or did you--
4:39 4:41 MALE:  [interposing]  No, I got a degree, yeah.  
4:41 4:42 FEMALE:  Oh, did you travel?  
4:42 4:49 MALE:  Yeah, so I taught in Florida and Chicago, yeah.  So, I taught a few years in Florida and then still on to Chicago.  Then I came back here, so...
4:50 4:51 FEMALE:  My father's a teacher.  
4:51 4:51 MALE:  Oh, really?  
4:51 4:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was actually going to be my job.  
4:55 4:55 MALE:  And what happened?  
4:56 4:58 FEMALE:  I decided to pursue my PhD instead.  
4:58 5:00 MALE:  [laughter]  It's a big difference.  
5:00 5:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, it is a big difference.  When I--I was going to go into Math and [unintelligible] conditions.  
5:05 5:05 MALE:  Okay.
5:06 5:12 FEMALE:  But then I decided that wasn't so great for a couple of years before I went back to [unintelligible].  
5:13 5:13 MALE:  Yeah.  
5:14 5:15 FEMALE:  Then I went to Taiwan and taught a little bit there.  
5:15 5:15 MALE:  Okay.  
5:15 5:18 FEMALE:  I taught [unintelligible].  
5:18 5:18 MALE:  Yeah.  
5:19 5:23 FEMALE:  But I guess I decided to maybe [unintelligible].  
5:24 5:24 MALE:  Yeah.  
5:25 5:26 FEMALE:  And like [unintelligible].  
5:26 5:27 MALE:  How do you like it?  
5:28 5:28 FEMALE:  I really like it.
5:28 5:28 MALE:  Yeah.
5:29 5:30 FEMALE:  And I always think, you know, I could go back and do things.
5:31 5:37 MALE:  Yeah, you can.  It's not that hard.  But probably a little harder to go back to after you get a PhD in geophysics.  
5:39 5:39 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you. 
5:39 5:40 MALE:  You too.  We'll talk later.
