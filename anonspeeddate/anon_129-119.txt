0:04 0:05 MALE:  Are you a female129?  
0:12 0:14 FEMALE:  I am.  I am.  
0:07 0:09 MALE:  Okay, I can barely tell under there.  I'm male119.  
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Hi, male119, nice to meet you.  Are you having fun?  
0:13 0:17 MALE:  Yeah, it's been good.  I arrived a little late so [unintelligible] was screaming a little bit.  
0:24 0:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, had to give you a crash course on how to fill out your--
0:19 0:21 MALE:  [interposing]  I know how to fill this out and everything.  
0:28 0:29 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] one together, huh?  
0:22 0:23 MALE:  I'm getting used to it, yeah.  
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  It's getting a little bit quicker.
0:25 0:25 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:32 0:36 FEMALE:  Numbers like three and four I was like, man, we're still on the second.  
0:29 0:30 MALE:  Yeah, oh  man.  
0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  So. 
0:31 0:36 MALE:  So, where--well, you can ask first, or--what are you doing in Stanford?
0:43 0:45 FEMALE:  I am at the school of ed. 
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Okay.  
0:45 0:47 FEMALE:  Studying policy, organization and leadership.
0:40 0:44 MALE:  Okay.  Wow, that's cool.  So, are you in a one-year program?
0:51 0:54 FEMALE:  Yes, nine months.  
0:45 0:47 MALE:  Wow, so you're wrapping up.  
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  Nine weeks away from the end.  
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Oh  man, what are you doing next?
0:57 1:05 FEMALE:  I don't know yet.  Uhm, I have two interviews tomorrow.  So, you know, the question is getting less traumatic.  Everybody wants to know.  
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Right, right.  
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  I was at home last weekend, and everybody was like, so, what are you doing next year?  I'm like don't ask.  
1:02 1:03 MALE:  I know.  It's a bad question.  I'm sorry.  
1:10 1:17 FEMALE:  No, no, no, it's getting better.  I am looking at jobs in non-profits doing some urban school reform.  
1:10 1:13 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Oh, excellent.  Are you thinking about staying here or going elsehere?  
1:20 1:24 FEMALE:  Uhm, I came from Boston, and would willingly move back to the East Coast.  
1:17 1:17 MALE: Oh yeah?
1:25 1:28 FEMALE: Maybe Boston or New York, but given a choice I think I'd like to stay in San Francisco.  
1:22 1:22 MALE: It's a nice place.  
1:29 1:31 FEMALE: My father is moved out here, so what about you?  
1:25 1:27 MALE: Well, I'm in my fifth year in mechanical engineering.  
1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Fifth year?  Must be [unintelligible].  
1:29 1:32 MALE: I know.  It's scary.  I thought I'd have a better grasp.  
1:39 1:40 FEMALE: Are you [unintelligible]?
1:33 1:35 MALE: Supposedly I am.  My advisor says I am.  
1:42 1:44 FEMALE: Congratulations.  That's exciting, and then what happens?  
1:38 1:41 MALE: See, that's like the exact same question.  I don't know.  
1:48 1:49 FEMALE: Don't answer it.  
1:42 2:01 MALE: I don't know.  I'm just trying to decide what I want to do if I want to go into academics or work in industry.  I don't--I'm not sure if I want to post doc or, for example, I'm interested in the medical device industry.  So, I'm interested in bios, medical.  [unintelligible], or actually I know somebody at [unintelligible] has offered me a job.  So...
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  It's a great place.  
2:03 2:04 MALE:  Yeah, it is.  I was there one summer at MIT.  
2:12 2:12 FEMALE: Okay.  
2:05 2:07 MALE: It was fun.  I got to sail on the Charles.  
2:14 2:19 FEMALE: Definitely the right time of year to be there, but, you know, winter--I think winter gets a bad rap.  
2:14 2:14 MALE: Winter, yeah.  
2:21 2:23 FEMALE: I loved winter in New England, so--
2:16 2:19 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, it was a little bit hot in Boston when I was there.  
2:26 2:29 FEMALE: It is because nobody has air conditioning either.  And like people don't know how to deal with summer.  
2:23 2:26 MALE: I had trouble.  So, are you from Boston originally?  
2:33 2:34 FEMALE: No, I'm actually from Houston.  
2:28 2:31 MALE: Houston, okay.  So, did you do--where did you do your undergrad?
2:38 2:38 FEMALE: In New Hampshire.
2:32 2:34 MALE: New Hampshire? Where did you do it in New Hampshire? 
2:42 2:42 FEMALE: Dartmouth.  
2:35 2:36 MALE: Okay, okay cool.  
2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  How about you?  
2:37 2:39 MALE: I went to [unintelligible] Princeton for my undergrad.  
2:46 2:46 FEMALE: Okay.  
2:40 2:40 MALE: The East Coast thing.  
2:48 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  I hear you.  Where did you grow up?  
2:44 2:45 MALE: In Los Angeles.  
2:52 2:55 FEMALE: Okay.  It's a big switch.  
2:49 2:51 MALE:  You mean switching over to the East Coast?  
2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:51 2:57 MALE:  I think it was good.  It was needed.  I have a lot of friends who came to Stanford, and I don't think they've seen the world.  
3:04 3:05 FEMALE:  I hear you.  
2:58 2:59 MALE:  You know, like the East Coast is just--
3:07 3:19 FEMALE: [interposing]  That's actually my big gripe about Boston is that I think especially Boston because it is such a great place.  But everybody who grew up in Boston goes to college in New England and ends up right back in Boston, and a lot of them never leave.  
3:12 3:12 MALE: Yeah. 
3:19 3:31 FEMALE: I understand it because I [unintelligible] from Boston.  There are a lot of [unintelligible] to say, but there still may be [unintelligible] and there were times I was like it's too bad you never left home.  
3:24 3:27 MALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] generalizing.  
3:34 3:35 FEMALE:  It's insulary.  
3:28 3:29 MALE: Exactly, that's what I was going to say.  
3:36 3:37 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:31 3:35 MALE: What have you been able to do out here while you've not been working 24/7?
3:42 3:43 FEMALE: I don't work 24/7.
3:37 3:38 MALE: Okay, that's good to hear.  That's good to hear.  
3:45 3:47 FEMALE: I've got to say I've done a lot of stuff.  
3:40 3:42 MALE: Yeah?  Do you do a lot of outdoor stuff?  
3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  I skied all winter.  
3:43 3:44 MALE: Oh, fantastic.  
3:51 3:53 FEMALE: I'm running a half marathon on Saturday so I've been--
3:46 3:47 MALE: [interposing]  Wildfire?  No--
3:55 3:55 FEMALE: Skyline?  
3:48 3:51 MALE:  Skyline--is that sort of off-trail a little bit?  
3:58 4:01 FEMALE: Yeah, a little more [unintelligible].  
3:55 3:57 MALE: Wow.  That should be exciting though, a little trail running.  
4:05 4:07 FEMALE: It will be fun.  It'll be fun.  So, yeah.  It was nice to meet you.  
4:00 4:01 MALE: Well, yeah, it was good talking with you.  
4:08 4:08 FEMALE: Have fun. 
4:02 4:02 MALE: Thanks, you too.
