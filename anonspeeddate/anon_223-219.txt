0:58 0:59 MALE:  So they don't, they don't have that here? 
1:00 1:05 FEMALE:  Um, well, they have beautiful golden hills here, but it's different, and it's a different kind, I don't different feeling.  
1:06 1:07 MALE:  Well I've never been to Kentucky, I wouldn't know.
1:08 1:15 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's like, how long have you been here, like at, like, as opposed to Sacramento? 
1:16 1:16 MALE:  Well I've been on the West Coast my whole life.
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:18 1:18 MALE:  So I went to Berkeley undergrad. 
1:19 1:19 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:20 1:20 MALE:  So now I'm here.  
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:21 1:21 MALE:  So I've been here for awhile.  
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  So you really like it here, you don't want to leave? 
1:23 1:23 MALE:  No, no, I don't think that's the case. 
1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:24 1:25 MALE:  I'm kind of, I'm kind of got, its circumstance.  
1:26 1:26 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:27 1:28 MALE:  But I think my next move would be somewhere different-- 
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:30 1:30 MALE:  --where, you know, 
1:31 1:31 FEMALE:  Like? 
1:32 1:32 MALE:  Anywhere.  [laughter] 
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Anywhere? 
1:33 1:33 MALE:  Anywhere not here.  
1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:35 1:35 MALE:  Do you like it out here or? 
1:36 1:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, but I want to actually like, you know, if I'm going to live in America, then I'd like to be here, but I'm really, I'm really interested in Japan right now, and--
1:44 1:44 MALE:  Really? 
1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  --that's where I want to go to when I get, as soon as I get out of here. 
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Cool, so is that what you're studying here or? 
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  Um, no, I'm studying linguistics. 
1:51 1:51 MALE:  Oh. 
1:51 1:57 FEMALE:  But it's like, just a hobby, like I'm studying Japanese and like, I don't know.  I went there to teach English before I came to grad school and felt--
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Oh cool. 
1:58 2:01 FEMALE:  --I started liking it.  That's, so that's what I'm headed towards, I think. 
2:02 2:04 MALE:  What is it like teaching English in, in, in Japan? 
2:05 2:07 FEMALE:  It was really hard, especially if you don't speak Japanese. 
2:08 2:08 MALE:  Okay. 
2:09 2:11 FEMALE:  And it was really fun though, I ended up really loving it and dying to go back. 
2:12 2:21 MALE:  So, so you, do you need to be there to be teaching English to people?  I mean do they see you pronounce things and be there?  I mean, how does that work?  
2:22 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, they-- the classrooms were way too overcrowded and so, like, it ended up me just leading games for, like, a room full 40 high school kids.  And silly little games, you know, and so they really probably didn't benefit that much from my English teaching, but they benefited more from just like interacting with a foreigner.  
2:42 2:42 MALE:  Oh. 
2:42 2:52 FEMALE:  Because like, that, that's a part of the big reason they have the foreigners come in to the schools so that all the, it's like internationalization, you know, and like and they can see what Americans are really like. 
2:53 2:55 MALE:  Right, right, right.  Oh they play board games all in America, huh? 
2:56 2:58 FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah and everybody's really perky and teach us English really good.  
2:59 2:59 MALE:  [laughter] 
3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:01 3:07 MALE:  So did you go to class and just Hi everybody--
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  [laughter] Oh yeah, it was fun though.  
3:07 3:08 MALE:  --I'm female223.  [laughter]  
3:08 3:12 FEMALE:  It was really fun, it was a blast.  Its like, to have all the attention and everybody just, you know, claps; they thought I was so funny, you know.  
3:13 3:13 MALE:  [laughter] 
3:13 3:17 FEMALE:  They thought I was this, you know, movie star, in their classroom.  It was hilarious. 
3:18 3:18 MALE:  Cool.  Which city was this in? 
3:19 3:24 FEMALE:  This was in Miyazaki, it's kind of down in Kyushu, like on the southeast Coast of like Kyushu, way down south. 
3:25 3:25 MALE:  Is that considered a big city?  
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  No, it's like 3:00,000 people.  It's a prefecture capital.  
           [horn]
3:29 3:31 MALE:  Oh okay.  [laughter] 
3:32 3:34 FEMALE:  I didn't even get to talk about yourself at all, I'm sorry. 
3:35 3:36 MALE:  Don't worry, I talk about myself enough in general.  
3:37 3:37 FEMALE:  [laughter]
