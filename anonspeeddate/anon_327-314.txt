1:03 1:04 MALE: So like Steven Pinkard type stuff?

1:52 1:55 FEMALE: Well my dad's an engineer, and my mother's a social worker.
1:55 1:57 MALE: Okay.  [unintelligible] doctor engineer.
1:57 1:59 FEMALE: So you know my mother's kind of [unintelligible] just a little unusual.  But you know.
2:00 2:00 MALE: It's a little [unintelligible] but still a professional.
2:01 2:02 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].
2:02 2:03 MALE: She loves it.
2:04 2:05 FEMALE: How about your parents?  What do they do?
2:06 2:07 MALE: Uh, yeah, they're both doctors.  Mom's a pediatrician--
2:07 2:07 FEMALE: Okay.
2:08 2:08 MALE: My dad's a [unintelligible].
2:09 2:09 FEMALE: And what do you do?
2:10 2:16 MALE: Uh, I'm an electrical engineer.  But I work at, you know, um, Bilex [phonetic], Clark Center?
2:17 2:17 FEMALE: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
2:17 2:17 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  That's where I work.
2:18 2:18 FEMALE: Okay.
2:18 2:20 MALE: So I do generic circuits.  So it's like a [unintelligible].
2:20 2:23 FEMALE: Okay.  So you're, you're not a graduate student here?
2:23 2:23 MALE: I am.  I am a PhD student.
2:24 2:24 FEMALE: Okay.
2:25 2:25 MALE: I'm graduating this year.
2:26 2:27 FEMALE: Oh I see.  Congratulations.
2:28 2:28 MALE: Yeah, well.
2:27 2:29 FEMALE: So are you looking forward to it or?
2:30 2:36 MALE: Uh, yeah, actually.  I mean, I hopefully [unintelligible].
2:36 2:36 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
2:37 2:37 MALE: See how that goes, whatever.  [unintelligible].
2:39 2:42 FEMALE: Yeah, definitely.  Do you hope to kind of stay in this area or?
2:43 2:53 MALE: Um, well, basically, I just want to be a [unintelligible].  So either, so like Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, CGR, Harvard, there's like a few of them that are really the big ones.
2:53 2:53 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
2:54 2:58 MALE: 'Cause the thing is, [unintelligible] sequencing is kind of like something where you need an economy of scales.  You need to be able to pick places.
2:59 2:59 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:59 3:00 MALE: So one of those four would be ideal.
3:01 3:05 FEMALE: [unintelligible] do you have like a favored city among the votes or?
3:05 3:09 MALE: Well uh, I mean, I like this area.  If I could, I would stay here.
3:09 3:09 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:09 3:13 MALE: But usually they don't want, you know, the inbred thing of hiring their own.  
3:13 3:13 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:14 3:16 MALE: They're a little bit against that, but whatever.  We'll see.  So I mean, not that I don't--
3:16 3:18 FEMALE: You can just head over to Berkeley, then, you know.
3:18 3:19 MALE: Yeah. Or you know, settle.
3:19 3:19 FEMALE: [unintelligible].
3:20 3:23 MALE: Exactly.  Yeah, it'd be great if I could get any place [unintelligible]. 
3:24 3:25 FEMALE: That's really awesome.
3:25 3:27 MALE: So where are you um planning to graduate like?
3:28 3:33 FEMALE: I'm hoping in the next year or so.  I'm kind of doing my field work for my dissertation right now.  So--
3:34 3:35 MALE: Who's your advisor or--
3:35 3:39 FEMALE: Um, I work with Ray McDermitt, and Didi [unintelligible].  I don't know you've--
3:39 3:40 MALE: I don't know.  I don't know.
3:40 3:41 FEMALE: --heard of those guys, but, um--
3:41 3:44 MALE: Well I just knew--I know Senal's [phonetic] advisor is nameX nameX.
3:44 3:54 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Um the stuff that I do is more psychology related than sociology related.  So people that I work with are kind of more anthropology/psychology people.
3:54 3:57 MALE: So do you actually take like little kids and, you know, subject them to tests and so on?
3:57 3:59 FEMALE: Yeah.  Well no.
3:59 4:01 MALE: You know, with your lab coats and monocles, right?
4:01 4:07 FEMALE: You know, if it were left up to me [laughter].  No, I actually kind of--I do more qualitative research.
4:07 4:07 MALE: Okay.
4:08 4:35 FEMALE: And so I shadow young children and families, I guess.  So the stuff that I'm doing right now, with--you know, I work on several different projects.  But the one that's kind of my own, I guess, um, is working in preschool classrooms.  And so I'm following a set of children from preschool to kindergarten.  Um, and to kind of see how they--I guess what I'm really interested in is how these cultural identities that young children develop at home, travel with them to school.
4:35 4:35 MALE: Okay.
4:36 4:37 FEMALE: And kind of, you know--
4:37 4:39 MALE: So it's sort of like a multicultural type of thing-- 
4:41 4:41 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:41 4:45 MALE: --where you're trying to figure out, say, Spanish [unintelligible] at home impacts school?  Something like that?  Or--
4:45 4:53 FEMALE: Um, well I don't think it has so, so much to do with language.  I mean, language is a part of it, I'm sure.  But I think it's more about kind of the social and moral types of knowledge that--
4:54 4:55 MALE: How many books are in the house, that sort of thing?  Like--
4:56 5:05 FEMALE: I don't even think it's so much about literacy.  I think it's more about, just, you know, kind of--it's like values, I guess.  You know, kind of the morals and social knowledge that young children--
5:05 5:06 MALE: So kind of like a narrative way of sort of--
5:06 5:15 FEMALE: Kind of, yeah.  Yeah.  Um, it's kind of like a case study approach to figuring out what kind of, you know, how young children negotiate their identity.
5:15 5:21 MALE: What are your major findings so far?  Or are you in the middle of doing it?
5:21 5:23 FEMALE: I'm in the middle of doing it.  Yeah.
5:23 5:23 MALE: To be announced.
5:23 5:40 FEMALE: I mean, I, I would hesitate to say.  I mean, I think that there's just a lot of interesting stuff about, you know, not just, you know, kind of home knowledge, but also the stuff that kind of teachers do in classrooms to negotiate children's understandings about these different things.  So yeah, it's been really cool.
5:40 5:41 MALE: Yeah.  Nice meeting you.
5:42 5:43 FEMALE: It was very nice meeting you, too.  Take care.
