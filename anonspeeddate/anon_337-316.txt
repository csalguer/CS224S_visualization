0:33 0:41 MALE:  I saw it come across the e-mail and I was like, oh, what the heck.  I've been to a couple of these--who [unintelligible] just got it all--we kind of talked each other into it, so we were like, okay, we'll go over there and do it.

0:44 0:46  FEMALE:  Oh, I see.  Well, I got it like on the last minute notice.

0:42 0:42 MALE:  Oh, you did?

0:47 0:51 FEMALE:  I just heard about it last night 'cause I think like a girl just backed out at the last minute.

0:46 0:52 MALE:  Yeah, I think they have a lot of problems getting the--filling out the [unintelligible] side of the roster versus the, uh, male side things.

0:56 1:02 FEMALE:  The male side.  Well, I heard it's a little fun, so I'm okay, sure, I'll do it.  So, I heard about it last night and I was like okay there's nothing to lose.

0:58 1:00 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, maybe you'll meet your future husband, right, you never know.

1:06 1:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, what school are you in?

1:04 1:06 MALE:  Um, I'm in business school so.

1:10 1:17 FEMALE:  Business school.  I'm in the medical school, but not really an MD.  So, I'm studying--well, I'm doing research at the bench, so I'm research scientist.

1:13 1:13 MALE:  Oh, really.

1:18 1:19 FEMALE:  In the field of microbiology so.

1:15 1:19 MALE:  So, you're just doing research in pursuit of some--of a masters degree or...?
 
1:24 1:27 FEMALE:  No, actually I'm--I'm done, so I'm--I'm a post doc right now.

1:23 1:23 MALE:  Oh, okay.

1:28 1:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:23 1:26 MALE:  So, you have a Ph.D. and you're just hanging out?

1:31 1:31 FEMALE:  Well--

1:27 1:29 MALE:  Or doing research?  But hanging out.

1:32 1:35 FEMALE:  Yeah doing research and preparing for my next job, yeah.

1:31 1:32 MALE:  What's your next job going to be do you know?

1:37 1:41 FEMALE:  Oh, hopefully research in some biotech companies maybe, yeah.

1:36 1:38 MALE:  Okay.  What was your Ph.D. in?

1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Microbiology.

1:39 1:39 MALE:  Microbiology.

1:44 1:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:40 1:41 MALE:  And how long did that take?

1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  Five and a half years.

1:43 1:45 MALE:  Well, that's pretty quick, isn't it or is that standard?

1:49 1:53 FEMALE:  Uh, it's average in [unintelligible] school.  Well, approximately five, six years usually.

1:49 1:49 MALE:  Yeah.  

1:54 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, so--how--so, like, did you work before you go to the business school? 

1:53 2:05 MALE:  Yeah, I worked for a few years in San Francisco.  And then, uh, I came down to the business school and I had a two year vacation--well, actually I had like a nine month vacation.  I had to work for the summer and then I have another nine-month vacation coming up when I get back I guess.

2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  Wow, that sounds fun.

2:07 2:08 MALE:  Yeah, it's great.  It's great.

2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  You're just like hanging out?

2:09 2:16 MALE:  Uh, basically.  I was telling you that my last person I'm actually in the middle of taking a test right now and besides that it's pretty good.  So, I have been taking home tests and [unintelligible] just doing it.

2:20 2:23 FEMALE:  Oh, you mean tonight or actually--like--

2:18 2:19 MALE:  It's due tonight, yeah.

2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.

2:19 2:20 MALE:  So, I started it and then I--

2:24 2:26  FEMALE:  Oh, interesting.

2:21 2:22 MALE:  --stopped and came to do some speed dating.

2:28 2:30 FEMALE:  It's quite a break.  It's quite an interesting break.

2:24 2:28 MALE:  Quite what?  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's kind of--

2:32 2:34 FEMALE:  I mean, the normal--not the--yeah, not the normal break, but yeah, oh, okay.

2:28 2:31 MALE:  --business school for you.  Say what?

2:35 2:39 FEMALE:  Not the normal break that you would just say, oh, let's go have a beer or watch some TV.

2:31 2:35 MALE:  No.  Have a coffee or something.  Yeah, no.

2:39 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah or watch the Apprentice or something like that.

2:36 2:39 MALE:  Well, you know, how--how can you pass an opportunity to meet 16 ladies, right?

2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  That's true.  Interesting.

2:42 2:47 MALE: Anyway.  So, um, do you usually date a lot of people at Stanford in the graduate school [unintelligible]?

2:50 3:01 FEMALE:  No, no 'cause I don't really get to meet other people outside of my department too much 'cause they are not--no, I just don't really get a chance.  I usually get stuck in the lab, so that's why I think about, oh, it will be nice chance to just go out and meet new people.

2:57 2:58 MALE:  Right, right.

3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:58 3:00 MALE:  How big is the lab that you work at?  How many people?

3:04 3:13 FEMALE:  Well, unfortunately, my lab is like winding down because my professor is retiring, so officially I am the only person in my lab.  But I got to hang out with the other people in the other labs so.

3:08 3:10 MALE:  So, when do you finish your Ph.D.?

3:15 3:17 FEMALE:  Oh, like three years ago.

3:13 3:14 MALE:  Oh, really.

3:18 3:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:14 3:15 MALE:  And you've been doing research the whole time?

3:20 3:20 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

3:16 3:23 MALE:  And what's the--like why haven't you transitioned into a--like say you want to go do research for like a biotech company, why haven't you done that yet?

3:29 3:31 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, because like--it's like a normal track for people in our field--

3:27 3:27 MALE:  Oh, really.

3:32 3:36 FEMALE:  --[unintelligible] Ph.D. and you do a post doc and then you can become a real--you get a real job later.

3:33 3:37 MALE:  But there's no kind of official distinction that happens after you finish your post doc or is there?

3:41 3:43 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Well, for post doc it's not like Ph.D. that you have to put in your thesis, you have to like--like [unintelligible] committee members.  

3:43 3:44 MALE:  Right.

3:44 4:04 FEMALE:  For post doc it's kind of like arbitrary if you think you're ready for the job market then you try to apply for jobs.  So, it's kind of like--the time span is not as discreet just like the Ph.D. program.  But usually we have to do it.  Like, there are people who don't have to do it, but not all the time.  These people have to.

4:00 4:00 MALE:  Wow.

4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Well, it was nice meeting you.

4:01 4:02 MALE:  Well, it was very nice to meet you.
