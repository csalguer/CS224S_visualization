MALE: All right.
0:02 0:02 FEMALE: Hello there.  How are you?
0:02 0:03 MALE: How are you?
0:03 0:03 FEMALE: I'm--
0:03 0:05 MALE: We met at one of these before, I think.  Didn't we? 
0:05 0:07 FEMALE: We might have.  We could have.
0:07 0:07 MALE: I'm not sure.  So many people, yeah.
0:07 0:10 FEMALE: Yeah.  Well it's nice to see you again, if that's the case.
0:11 0:11 MALE: [unintelligible].  Are you having fun?
0:11 0:12 FEMALE: Yeah, how about yourself?
0:13 0:14 MALE: Oh not too bad.
0:14 0:15 FEMALE: Really good.
0:15 0:19 MALE: At least we can hear at this one. I remember at the last one was ridiculously loud.  
0:19 0:19 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:20 0:24 MALE: And I'm friends with [unintelligible].  I was kind of afraid, you know, how is she ever going to get anything on these recorders.
0:24 0:25 FEMALE: I know.  Seriously.
0:26 0:26 MALE: But it's--this is nice.
0:26 0:33 FEMALE: Kind of like a more relaxed setting, you know.  I don't know, maybe it has something to do with these like cubicle walls, you know [laughter].
0:34 0:36 MALE: These noise partitions. Yeah.  They're kind of a must, I think [unintelligible].
0:36 0:40 FEMALE: It's kind of interesting.  So tell me about yourself.  I'm sorry.  I don't remember.  What do you do?
0:40 0:41 MALE: Well I'm a C.S. guy.  And I know there are a lot of us, so that could be why. 
0:41 0:44 FEMALE: Okay.  I don't think there are actually a lot of C.S. guys here today.
0:44 0:46 MALE: It's kind of in the air around here.  I don't know. 
0:46 0:47 FEMALE: [unintelligible].  Who can tell [laughter]?
0:48 0:52 MALE: I don't know.  So I'm working on a PhD, uh, my third year now.
0:53 0:53 FEMALE: Yeah.  Okay.
0:54 0:55 MALE: I actually don't remember what you do.
0:56 1:00 FEMALE: I'm in the school of education, actually.  I study early childhood development, so.
1:01 1:02 MALE: What are you going to end up doing with that?  Do you know?
1:03 1:17 FEMALE: I'm going to stay in research for a while, you know, work at a research institute or think tank or government agency of some sort.  But you know, that's a bit far away.  I think we're going to work on the dissertation first, and then worry about the rest later.
1:18 1:21 MALE: Exactly.  I'm looking for a topic now, and kind of kicking my butt.
1:22 1:24 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  How long do people in your program usually take to--
1:25 1:25 MALE: Five or six years.  I guess.
1:25 1:25 FEMALE: Okay. 
1:26 1:26 MALE: I'm staying six. 
1:27 1:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.
1:28 1:30 MALE: For no good reason other than it's kind of what I could say.
1:31 1:32 FEMALE: Right, right.
1:32 1:32 MALE: I don't know.  What about you?  Is it the same or?
1:34 1:43 FEMALE: Um, I think there's a sliding scale for different students, different timelines and things like that.  Um, I'm hoping to finish in the next year or so.
1:43 1:44 MALE: What will that be total for you?
1:45 2:09 FEMALE: Uh, so that would be five years, I guess.  But kind of doesn't really count, because I did, I did a master's for a year in Boston.  And then I started my PhD out in New York, where I was for like two years, where I did kind of course work for one year, and more kind a of research for the next year.  Uh, and I transferred out here.  And so, I feel like I've been in graduate school for quite some time now, too.
2:09 2:10 MALE: Yeah.  Well I've [unintelligible] too.
2:11 2:11 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:12 2:13 MALE: It's only been three years.
2:13 2:13 FEMALE: It's kind of crazy right?
2:14 2:15 MALE: Yeah.  It's an interesting experience.
2:16 2:17 FEMALE: Yeah.  Definitely.
2:17 2:22 MALE: I don't know. So now, I know in C.S. there are like no women.  Are there no guys in education?
2:22 2:33 FEMALE: Oh yeah, no.  I mean, particularly, I think, kind of in, you know, the PhD track or whatever, there is even fewer I would say.  There's just few in general.  But yeah.
2:33 2:37 MALE: Yeah.  I mean, I think we're like 10% or something.  Maybe--I don't know.
2:37 2:57 FEMALE: Oh I don't know anything about like percentage or anything like that.  But I mean, the other thing is too, I think after your first few years or whatever, you tend to kind of be doing your own research, and so you don't even see like your other, you know, friends from your cohorts and stuff.  So you know, it's kind of hard to like stay connected and stuff like that.
2:57 3:00 MALE: Yeah.  I mostly hang out with other people, not C.S. people.
3:00 3:01 FEMALE: Why is that?
3:02 3:03 MALE: C.S. people are kind of boring.  [laughter] Am I allowed to say that?
3:05 3:05 FEMALE: [unintelligible] disloyal [laughter] .
3:09 3:11 MALE: I don't know.  I have interests not involving sitting in front of a screen.
3:12 3:12 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:12 3:13 MALE: Although I do sit in front of a screen a lot. 
3:14 3:15 FEMALE: Well you know, you've got to do that sometimes.
3:16 3:18 MALE: I like cultural stuff, you know.  I like to read.
3:18 3:18 FEMALE: What do you like to do?
3:19 3:23 MALE: I like reading a lot.  I read way too much, actually.  When I should be doing research, I'm reading.
3:25 3:26 FEMALE: What's the last thing you read?  
3:27 3:28 MALE: The last thing I read?  Well right now--
3:29 3:30 FEMALE: Or what's the thing that you really want to read that you haven't read?
3:30 3:32 MALE: All right.  Well this is going to sound really bad.
3:33 3:33 FEMALE: All right.  Go ahead.
3:34 3:35 MALE: It's from this awesome book, called The Road to Reality.
3:36 3:36 FEMALE: The Road to Reality--
3:37 3:38 MALE: It's like this 1100 page book.
3:39 3:39 FEMALE: Wow.
3:39 3:41 MALE: The subtitle's A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe.
3:42 3:42 FEMALE: Wow.
3:42 3:45 MALE: It's like holy crap.  This looks awesome.  It's by Roger Penrose [phonetic].
3:45 3:45 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:45 3:52 MALE: It's like, yeah, listen to it.  I mean, [unintelligible] finish it. I just want to know what all that stuff is.  And all these--I hadn't really seen these symbols. 
3:52 3:53 FEMALE: Very cool.
3:53 3:54 MALE: And what the hell is this stuff?  So.
3:54 3:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:56 3:56 MALE: That's next on my list.
3:56 3:58 FEMALE: Well good luck in finishing that book, or starting it.
3:59 4:01 MALE: Or starting it, yeah [laughter].  I have to buy it first.  It's 40 bucks.
4:03 4:03 FEMALE: Well it was nice meeting you again, male313.
4:03 4:04 MALE: Nice meeting you.
4:05 4:05 FEMALE: Take care. 
4:05 4:05 MALE: Good luck tonight.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE: Maybe I'm not--
