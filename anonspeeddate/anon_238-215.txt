00:23  00:28	MALE:  [laughter] not a Californian accent or is it.  So how long have you been here for?
00:29  00:32	FEMALE:  In California, for I think six years now.
00:33  00:34	MALE:  Oh, wow.  You must like it here then.
00:35  00:43	FEMALE:  I do, I do.  Well, I mean I've been kind of tied to campus.  So I don't know if I've experienced California as much.  But what about you?  Are you --
00:44  00:45	MALE:  Well, I've only been here for a few weeks.
00:45  00:46	FEMALE:  Oh really.
00:46  00:47	MALE:  Or six weeks.  Yes.
00:47  00:48	FEMALE:  What program are you starting.
00:48  00:49	MALE:  Genetics.
00:49  00:52	FEMALE:  Oh.  And is this your first trip to the U.S.?
00:53  00:54	MALE:  Well I've been here several times, before. 
00:54  00:54	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
00:55  00:57	MALE:  But it's the first summer here for more than a few weeks. 
00:58  00:59	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Have you been adjusting okay?
01:00  01:01	MALE:  Yeah.  I'm enjoying it so far.
01:02  01:02	FEMALE:  Yeah. Cool.
01:03  01:05	MALE:  It's really good.  It's kind of different but sort of similar at the same time.
01:06  01:07	FEMALE:  Where are you living?
01:07  01:08	MALE:  Lyman.
01:08  01:12	FEMALE:  Okay.  My last date was at Lyman.  It must be a Lyman crowd.
01:13  01:13	MALE:  Right.
01:14  01:15	FEMALE:  So.  And how's your roommate?  Did you get a good match?
01:16  01:18	MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  He's a good guy.
01:19  01:20	FEMALE:  Cool.  That's important.
01:21  01:23	MALE:  I haven't spent much time with him yet, but I don't know I guess we're both busy.
01:24  01:34	FEMALE:  I was really scared to like signup for graduate housing when I came because I was afraid I would like be in an apartment with a random like Bulgarian chemist or something, you now [laughter].
01:35  01:37	MALE:  Yeah I wasn't a bit wild about it [laughter].
01:38  01:40	FEMALE:  And be like yeah, I have nothing to talk to you about.  But --
01:41  01:42	MALE:   So you're not in graduate housing now?
01:43  02:02	FEMALE:  No, you know what I did, I lived -- I moved in to Colanday so it was an undergrad co-op there were 50 people in it, three of us were grad students, but the other 47 were undergrads.  It was really the best thing I ever did.  It was really fun.  I mean you have to live with 50 other people, so there's that, but I could deal with that.  So it was very good for me.  So what part of England are you from?
02:03  02:03	MALE:  From London.  Very original.
02:04  02:08	FEMALE:  I haven't heard of that, part.
02:09  02:09	MALE:  London [laughter]?
02:09  02:11	FEMALE:  I'm kidding, so yeah.
02:12  02:12	MALE:  Sorry.
02:13  02:16	FEMALE:  Yeah. Well are you dealing with the suburbs okay?
02:17  02:32	MALE:  Yeah, I'm from the suburbs so you know.  London is, I don't know it's sort of quite big I'd say or not central London.  And so I spent some time in Cambridge as well before coming here.  So you've been in Stanford for six years?
02:33  02:40	FEMALE:  Yeah, well five I took a year off in the middle.  But yeah I'm finishing this summer I think. I hope.
02:41  02:42	MALE:  What are you planning to go next?
02:42  02:46	FEMALE:  Ah, I'm going back to the exact same job that I had before I came to Stanford.  Which is --
02:47  02:47	MALE:  It still exists.
02:48  02:52	FEMALE:  Probably not the normal thing to do, but I'm going to go back to teaching fifth grade.
02:53  02:54	MALE:  Oh right, wow.
02:55  03:04	FEMALE:  And you know I'll be doing some research and I've got some other things going on.  But yeah, I was a teacher before I came and I really miss kids and I just can't get excited about teaching adults.  So, that's what I'm going to do.
03:05  03:08	MALE:  You teach a particular subject or specialize in?
03:09  03:19	FEMALE:  Um, well when you're teaching younger kids you usually -- you teach all of the subjects.  But, I do most of my research on writing and language arts, so.  Those are my best subjects.
03:20  03:21	MALE:  Okay.  Good.
03:22  03:24	FEMALE:  So have you done speed dating before?
03:25  03:25	MALE:  Once before, yeah.
03:26  03:27	FEMALE:  Really, where?
03:27  03:28	MALE:  In the U.K.
03:28  03:29	FEMALE:  Okay.  This was my first time.
03:30  03:33	MALE:  Okay, how is it going for you so far after the third date or during the third date?
03:34  03:38	FEMALE:  I guess its fine. I don't know I'm a little bewildered.  Do you have any tips for me?
03:39  03:45	MALE:  Ah, just be yourself I think is the main thing isn't it.  
03:46  03:48	FEMALE:  For sure, it's a tip for life.
03:49  04:02	MALE:  After a while its more of a warning you get a bit tired and it's hard to get the energy going but then if you meet interesting people then its all natural anyway and it flows.  So that's what you go with [horn].  Okay.
04:03  04:04	FEMALE:  Well, I'll take that to heart.  
04:04  04:05	MALE:  Good luck.
04:05  04:06	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
04:06  04:07	MALE:  Yeah, you too.
