00:01  00:02	FEMALE2:  [unintelligible] [laughter]
00:03  00:14 	MALE:  [horn] I hate that horn.  That's right.  How about like a harp or something like that.
00:15  00:15	FEMALE:  Gentle.
00:16  00:22	MALE:  Gentle, soothing, chimes, the sound of ocean waves crashing.
00:23  00:24	FEMALE:  That's another study their doing.
00:25  00:26	MALE:  When you come to a station everyone's like --
00:27  00:32	FEMALE:  We've got the horn I think, they test out.  It's really a study of reaction [unintelligible].
00:33  00:39	MALE:  That's right.  These aren't really tape recorders; they're like the measure how far you flinch every time they blow the horn [laughter].
00:40  00:43	FEMALE:  [laughter] exactly [horn].  Like that [laughter].  [horn] like that.
00:44  00:46	MALE:  You already blew the horn.
00:47  00:50	FEMALE:  So you are a med student from what you commented about caffeine?
00:51  00:52	MALE:  No, no, no.
00:53  00:53	FEMALE:  [laughter].
00:54  01:07	MALE:  But I've recently learned that caffeine is evil.  So the um, yeah, I did.  Um, so um, I've actually just started to give blood.  It turns out that I --
01:08  01:09	FEMALE:  That you couldn't?
01:09  01:13	MALE:  I couldn't give it for a variety of reasons like.   I don't know it's really hard to give blood.
01:14  01:16	FEMALE:  I couldn't give blood because I lived in England for more than six months [laughter].
01:17  01:19	MALE:  Same here.  Same here.  It's like --
01:20  01:21	FEMALE:  I don't eat meat [laughter].
01:21  01:25	MALE:  They don't care.  They don't care.  That's not the question they ask.
01:26  01:39	FEMALE:  That's true.  I've decided though, I think it's within the boundaries of ethics to answer that question untruthfully if I know I -- like I haven't eaten meat in like 13 years.  I'm like I really do not have mad cow [laughter].
01:40  01:44	MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
01:45  01:47	FEMALE:  I mean, it seems to me that when you're weighing things.
01:48  01:51	MALE:  But it's a hard ethical question whenever you take -- I mean when you take matters into your hands.
01:52  01:54	FEMALE:  True, because you don't want others taking matters into their own hands.
01:55  01:56	MALE:  Right.  There's a certain level of arrogance.
01:57  01:57	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:58  02:01	MALE:  Like I know better than the authority sitting in front of me telling me I can or can't do this.
02:02  02:02	FEMALE:  That's true.
02:03  02:04	MALE:  But we do it everyday in our lives, right?
02:04  02:04	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
02:04  02:05	MALE:  Every time we get in a car we don't do that.
02:05  02:06	FEMALE:  Right.
02:07  02:08	MALE:  We don't really stop.  We don't really like --
02:09  02:12	FEMALE:  We don't signal with the appropriate amount of time, yards or whatever.
02:13  02:15	MALE:  Yeah, what is it suppose to be like 20 seconds, [unintelligible] for 20 seconds.
02:16  02:21	FEMALE:  You get really sick of the clicking noise at that point and then you turn it off and then like oh come on, yeah.  So you know --
02:22  02:27	MALE:  Put on your signal and wait for 20 seconds and you got people going by you, hey grandpa get out of the passing lane, you know.  I'm like --
02:28  02:29	FEMALE:  I'm sure I can find a philosopher to justify my point.  
02:30  02:34	MALE:  It's like [laughter].
02:35  02:42	FEMALE:  It wouldn't to be [unintelligible] [laughter].  But someone out there I'm sure would be totally willing.
02:43  02:43	MALE:  So what's your major?
02:44  02:46	FEMALE:  I do, ah, like history and philosophy education.
02:47  02:49	MALE:  Oh, history and philosophy education.
02:50  02:51	FEMALE:  Yeah, pretty much education -- so of education, yeah.
02:51  02:54	MALE:  Okay, okay.  So you're another Education major.
02:55  02:56	FEMALE:  I'm another Ed School; I'm just one of the line [laughter], yeah.
02:57  02:58	MALE:  Well the business school is on the other side.
02:58  02:59	FEMALE:  Oh, really?  I didn't realize that.
02:59  03:02	MALE:  Yeah, those four girls, one, two, three, four all business majors.
03:03  03:04	FEMALE:  Wow, I had no idea.
03:05  03:07	MALE:  Have you come across any engineers in the line?
03:08  03:08	FEMALE:  No, no. 
03:09  03:09	MALE:  No.
03:11  03:12	FEMALE:  No.  Because, there were some engineers earlier broken up.
03:12  03:12	MALE:  Oh, okay, okay.
03:13  03:15	FEMALE:  They didn't seem to put too much thought into categorizing the men [laughter].
03:16  03:20	MALE:  I'm wondering.  Okay.  Well, I don't know if you realize they put some thought in categorizing the women either.
03:21  03:22 	FEMALE:  I don't know if they actually put any thought into it [laughter].
03:23  03:26	MALE:  You hear that [unintelligible].
03:27  03:34	FEMALE:  I mean, it may well be they just like the order in which like set your form in.  You know.
03:35  03:37	MALE:  I don't know -- it could like really influence things.
03:38  03:38	FEMALE:  It sure does.
03:39  03:42	MALE:  You start off the evening with a couple of awkward dates, you know.
03:43  03:43	FEMALE:  Right.
03:44  03:49	MALE:  And not to say that engineers are a stereotype, but engineers tend to be kind of awkward.
03:50  04:02	FEMALE:  Well, it's interesting though because it can be counter balanced right?  So you start awkward and then you -- you sort of get more comfortable with it.  But at the same token you start like fresh, right?  You got more energy.  By the end you're potentially although not necessarily more tired.  So there's sort of --
04:03  04:04	MALE:  It sort of depends on who you are though, right?
04:04  04:04	FEMALE:  Right, yeah.
04:05  04:06	MALE:  So if you're extroverted you get energy from like this.
04:06  04:08	FEMALE:  Like whoa.
04:09  04:11	MALE:  Like the more you go the faster your going.
04:12  04:12	FEMALE:  True.
04:13  04:14	MALE:  Next thing you know you're moving heavy furniture.
04:15  04:19	FEMALE:  Right.  You're absolutely right.  But, you know.
04:20  04:21	MALE:  Or if you're introverted 
04:21  04:27	FEMALE:  You're like oh my god, like can I hide under the table at this one [laughter].
04:28  04:29	MALE:  She wants to talk again.
04:30  04:33	FEMALE:  No, I like to talk, that means me.  I don't know.  So --
04:34  04:36	MALE:  So --
04:37  04:38	FEMALE:  I guess there's no perfect way to design these things.
04:39  04:40	MALE:  No, no.  Its fine [horn].
04:41  04:43	FEMALE:  All right well.
04:44  04:45	MALE:  It was a pleasure.
04:45  04:46	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
