01:21 01:21 FEMALE: Yeah.  
01:22 01:41 MALE: Well, yeah, that was the thing.  She said, when I came--she read into that opening.  She said, when I came, I said, "You said 'dude.'"  She said, "I pick up a lot."  I go, "Are you from Southern California?" as a joke.  And she's, like, well, I pick up on a lot of these things because I'm not a native speaker.  Sounds like, uh, that's funny.  She's, like, yeah, I have problems saying words.  I said what?  She said, like swear words.  It's, like, what swear words?  
01:41 01:42 FEMALE: That's when--okay.  
01:42 01:48 MALE: And she said fuck.  Then we had a discussion about fuck.  And then I said well what's your favorite swear word and she said cunt.  And I was, like, wow.  
01:48 01:48 FEMALE: There you go.  
01:49 01:52 MALE: And then she said that's not funny.  You were supposed to make a witty remark to cunt.

01:55 01:57 MALE: Which I'm--you had to know what the witty remark's supposed to make.  
[Crosstalk]

02:05 02:05 FEMALE: Yeah.  
02:05 02:06 MALE: And she's the first one that I've ever met.  
02:06 02:08 FEMALE: Unless you're using it in a reference to someone you don't like.  But--
02:09 02:13 MALE: You see, a guy could never use it.  Even if you hated a girl, I don't think I could say she's a cunt.  
02:14 02:15 FEMALE: Another girl there being, like--
02:15 02:27 MALE: Yeah, no, no, just we're out, right?  And your arch enemy comes up.  And I'd be, like, yea, she seems like kind of a bitch.  But if I just said out of the blue, "she's such a cunt," and you'd be, like, totally, like--you'd be mad, right?  
02:27 02:28 FEMALE: I think I'd be mad.  
02:30 02:30 MALE: Taken aback.  
02:29 02:32 FEMALE: I'd be a little bit, like, weirded out, but if it was someone with a really good line, I'd be, like, whatever.  
02:33 02:34 MALE: You mean, like go for it?  
02:34 02:35 FEMALE: Right.  But if it's someone--
02:35 02:37 MALE: Down with the bitch.  Down with the bitch.  
02:39 02:48 FEMALE: Yeah, I think [unintelligible] they'll say [unintelligible] If some of you were trying to be, like, standing up for me [unintelligible].  But if it's somebody I don't care about, if I'm [unintelligible].  
02:49 02:54 MALE: What is--did you find offense--do you take offense to the word cunt or no?  So you said you would call someone a cunt?  
02:55 03:00 FEMALE: I usually don't.  Like, I like [unintelligible] so that's my favorite.  I like the whole pseudo-gang stuff.  
03:00 03:01 MALE: Pseudo-gang stuff.

03:28 03:29 FEMALE: Then how do you know about the SkyBar?
[Crosstalk]
03:38 03:39 MALE: I think, like, the Standards a long ways from Stanford.  
03:43 03:44 FEMALE: nameX, are you the business school?  
03:45 03:49 MALE: Where do get that?  Do you think I'm in the business school?  Why do you say that?

03:51 03:52 MALE: [unintelligible] 
03:54 03:56 FEMALE: They did.  [unintelligible] 
03:57 04:05 MALE: You realize that--do you know think that if you're to say, okay, you have to go on a date with a guy from any one of the departments in Stanford, we'd take business school, right?   [Crosstalk]
04:05 04:05     FEMALE: No.  
04:06 04:07 MALE: Why?  You think we're assholes?  
04:07 04:08 FEMALE: No, but I don't know if I'd pick a certain department.  
04:09 04:10 MALE: Are we really aggressive?  No, you had to.  
04:09 04:10 FEMALE: If I had to?  
04:11 04:12 MALE: Yeah [unintelligible] 
04:13 04:17 FEMALE: See, I think maybe law school, but then, like, I don't know.  They seem to be a little too anal [unintelligible] 
04:17 04:19 MALE: They study a little bit too much.  
04:19 04:19 FEMALE: You guys don't study though?    
04:20 04:22 MALE: Not at all.  [unintelligible] typing test, though.  
04:21 04:23 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  [laughter]  I guess you don't [unintelligible] 
04:25 04:25 MALE: So what do you do?  
04:25 04:25 FEMALE: I'm English.  
04:26 04:27 MALE: An English Ph.D.?  
04:26 04:27 FEMALE: Yeah.  
04:28 04:28 MALE: Wow.
