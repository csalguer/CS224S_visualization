1:51 1:54 MALE:  [unintelligible] I guess [unintelligible] story [unintelligible].
1:54 2:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  He had a lot of good stories.  I think because he's a Harvard MBA he just has a soft spot for MBA's.  So maybe that's why he lets all the MBA's in.  I don't know.
2:03 2:06 MALE:  Oh, I guess maybe if I applied to business school later on [unintelligible].
2:06 2:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, you can come back.  So are you doing like a two year program or -

3:10 3:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's kind of a racket.  It's like two years of going back to college but you remembered all the parties.  You didn't go into college and so you go to them in business school and -
3:18 3:19 MALE:  Yeah -
3:19 3:20 FEMALE:  [laughter], yeah, it's a good time.

3:28 3:29 MALE:  [unintelligible] -
3:29 3:40 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly, wine tasting and I think that's one of the biggest.  And uh, actually nameX [phonetic] ran the um -- the like eat club, which is our like the cooking like -
3:38 3:40 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:42 3:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, so people sign up to do dinners and people come and have dinners and I think that's one of the biggest things, yeah.  So -
3:48 3:52 MALE:  Are you going to be part of the um, [unintelligible] show this Friday or?
3:52 3:55 FEMALE:  Well, I'm probably helping out back stage actually.  Are you planning on going?
3:56 4:00 MALE:  I'm hoping to.  I [unintelligible] for work [unintelligible] they're sold out and [unintelligible].
4:00 4:11 FEMALE:  The early show is cheaper though.  So if you go to the one at eight, it's not sold out.  I think it's eight, seven thirty or something like that.  You go to the early one, it's not sold out and it's cheaper, so you might want to try it.  It's so -
4:11 4:14 MALE:  [unintelligible] difference [unintelligible] like at 10 o'clock -
4:14 4:30 FEMALE:  Well the earlier one is supposed to be more for families.  So they make less of the um, sexual innuendos and like language.  They say they're a little better about that.  But I think it's still -- you still get the same -- yeah, it's -- it's hilarious like -
4:30 4:35 MALE:  [unintelligible] the [unintelligible] production like during the big game week?
4:35 4:36 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:36 4:38 MALE:  [unintelligible] pretty interesting [unintelligible] some of the stuff [unintelligible].
