0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  It's nice to meet you.  
0:22 0:22 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
0:24 0:24 FEMALE:  Are you Korean?
0:23 0:24 MALE:  Yeah.  How did you know?
0:27 0:27 FEMALE:  'Cause I'm Korean.
0:26 0:26 MALE:  Oh.
0:29 0:31 FEMALE:  And I can tell from listening to you talk that you're Korean.
0:29 0:32 MALE:  I see.  But you, you don't speak like a Korean.
0:35 0:37 FEMALE:  I've been born and raised in the U.S.
0:35 0:35 MALE:  I see.
0:38 0:43 FEMALE:  I was just in the motherland, over spring break.  Two weeks ago--three weeks ago, I went to Korea.
0:41 0:41 MALE:  Yeah.
0:43 0:45 FEMALE:  Lots of shopping.
0:43 0:45 MALE:  Is your family still there or?
0:48 1:07 FEMALE:  Um, I--you know, my core family is here.  But I have a lot of relatives, aunts, uncles, cousins, um, a lot on my mother's side, who still live in Korea.  So.  Um, are we supposed to be having a break now?  Or--I'm confused.
1:06 1:07 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  We are having a break.
1:10 1:10 FEMALE:  That was a break?
1:10 1:10 MALE: Do you want some cookies or something?
1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  Oh, actually, I'm just going to walk around and, um--
1:13 1:13 MALE:  Yeah.  Get some stretch.
1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  --stretch a little bit.

[mic left on during break]

2:53 2:55 MALE:  Actually, you know, you should write L here.
2:56 3:00 FEMALE:  L?  My station number's C.
3:02 3:03 MALE:  Oh wait.  I messed up.
3:05 3:07 FEMALE:  I'm pretty sure I'm C.
3:07 3:09 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's right.
3:10 3:10 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  I'm C.
3:11 3:24 MALE:  So I should--I'm supposed to write my station, is it?  [unintelligible].  Oh yes.  [unintelligible] you will always write [unintelligible], right?
3:24 3:28 FEMALE:  Well I don't think I actually have to write it, to be honest.  'Cause I think it's on my first page.
3:28 3:30 MALE:  So you always write here, right?
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:31 3:32 MALE:  'Cause then, for me, it seems I switch the station.
3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.  You should be switching all the time.
3:34 3:36 MALE:  Yeah.  It's so confusing.
3:37 3:44 FEMALE:  What program are you in [laughter]?  How did you get into Stanford?  I'm just teasing.
3:45 3:56 MALE:  [unintelligible] most [unintelligible] asked questions, like what program and which year?  And where I'm from.  And 'cause you know already where I'm from, you know.
3:56 4:01 FEMALE:  Let me guess.  You're in a science program.  Engineering?  No?  What are you in?
4:03 4:05 MALE:  It's a science.  It's a social science.
4:06 4:06 FEMALE:  Anthropology?
4:08 4:09 MALE:  The business school.
4:10 4:17 FEMALE:  You're in B-school?  What year are you?  Second year or first year?  I thought [unintelligible].
4:17 4:19 MALE:  [unintelligible].
4:21 4:24 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  What are you getting a PhD in?
4:26 4:43 MALE:  I study finance, and that's different--[unintelligible] it's different from a MBA in the sense that if you want to be professors who can teach MBAs eventually and then also write papers about business.
4:45 4:51 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  I didn't know that.  So why did you come here to study?  Had you been here in the U.S. for undergraduate?  Or you just came here?
4:52 4:54 MALE:  I did my under in Korea.
4:54 4:56 FEMALE:  So [unintelligible]?  Where?
4:58 5:14 MALE:  No, no.  That was [unintelligible] probability idea of the world's population engineering or [unintelligible] admission in universe be controlled.  Unfortunately, I'm probably [unintelligible].
5:14 5:16 FEMALE:  I probably would have done [unintelligible].
5:16 5:25 MALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] here sometimes, if you're an engineer.  So which school?
5:26 5:26 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.
5:26 5:36 MALE:  So probably there's no [unintelligible], 'cause we don't have such a science program for [unintelligible].
5:37 5:38 FEMALE:  No.  I don't think so.
5:39 5:40 MALE:  It's like something like [unintelligible].
5:40 5:40 FEMALE:  Something like what?
5:41 5:44 MALE:  [unintelligible] or MIT, engineering [unintelligible].
5:45 5:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No [unintelligible].  So you're going to stay in the U.S. or are you going back [unintelligible]?
5:52 5:52 MALE:  Depends.
5:54 5:54 FEMALE:  What does it depend on?
5:56 6:06 MALE:  Depends on whether I can get a good job in here, or if I, you know, would, you know, meet a woman I can stay here [unintelligible].
6:07 6:09 FEMALE:  Is your family--are they still back in Korea or--
6:10 6:21 MALE:  No.  They all live there.  And I'm the only one [unintelligible] in U.S.  It's been already five years since I [unintelligible].  Yeah.
6:23 6:29 FEMALE:  I was surprised [unintelligible].  I went to Korea, and I was like, man I could live here forever.  The food was so good.  The shopping was so good.
6:30 6:31 MALE:  [unintelligible] right?
6:32 6:36 FEMALE:  No.  It wasn't so cheap. But, I mean, it was just different.
6:37 6:37 MALE:  Uh-huh.
6:39 6:41 FEMALE:  It was really good.  Looks like we need to [unintelligible].
