0:00 0:01 FEMALE: Oh my goodness gracious.

0:04 0:05 MALE: [laughter]

0:02 0:04 FEMALE: I can't keep up, I swear.

0:06 0:10 MALE: I know.  Like speed filling out forms is what this should be called.

0:08 0:08 FEMALE: [laughter] Yeah.  

0:21 0:22 MALE: [laughter] 

0:17 0:21 FEMALE: Starting to fade.  Okay.  I can't write the numbers without going like this.

0:25 0:25 MALE: Hi. 

0:22 0:23 FEMALE: Hi, female121.

0:26 0:26 MALE: male105.

0:24 0:25 FEMALE: Nice to see you.

0:27 0:32 MALE: I'm assuming that--the only other person I saw wearing one of those pink hearts was in education as well.

0:29 0:33 FEMALE: It was. They gave it to me and I am in education.  [laughter]  Are you?  

0:36 0:36 MALE: No.

0:34 0:35 FEMALE: What do you do?

0:37 0:39 MALE: I am a mechanical engineer.

0:36 0:36 FEMALE: Excellent.

0:40 0:40 MALE: Yeah.

0:38 0:39 FEMALE: So you don't get a heart.

0:42 0:43 MALE: No, no.

0:40 0:42 FEMALE: I'm sure if you asked them for one they would give you one.

0:46 0:46 MALE: [laughter] 

0:43 0:44 FEMALE: I'm sure.

0:47 0:51 MALE: Oh, that's okay.  I can live with that.  I've got [unintelligible] 

0:48 0:50 FEMALE: Pretty good.  Your special treat?

0:52 0:52 MALE: [laughter] 

0:51 0:52 FEMALE: Are you having fun?

0:54 1:06 MALE: I am.  This is actually even pretty cool.  This is my first event like this ever.  A friend of mine and I mutually talked each other into coming.  It was one of those things that neither one of us was like yeah we'll do it.   

1:04 1:04 FEMALE: Right.

1:06 1:08 MALE: So both of us are like if you'll do it I'll do it.

1:06 1:09 FEMALE: Exactly.  [laughter]  All right I'll do it.  All right then I'll do it.  Exactly.

1:12 1:12 MALE: Yeah.

1:10 1:20 FEMALE: Totally.  Yeah, it's kind of interesting.  I've actually met the most people outside of the ed school practically this evening than I've met the whole time.  You know what I mean? 

1:23 1:23 MALE: Oh right on.

1:21 1:22 FEMALE: I don't think we branch out very much.

1:25 1:32 MALE: I think that a lot of the schools tend to kind of close in on themselves and you know like, oh there's other people here.  Oh wow.

1:30 1:30 FEMALE: Mm hmm.

1:33 1:40 MALE: I think that people I-I recognized one person and I knew the person that I came here with.

1:38 1:38 FEMALE: Right.

1:41 1:43 MALE: And so that was like everybody else has been new.

1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Right.

1:43 1:45 MALE: So it's been really fun.

1:42 1:46 FEMALE: It is fun.  Because then they should have everyone go to a bar another night and hang out.

1:49 1:50 MALE: That would be really cool.

1:47 1:52 FEMALE: This is like such a weird--  You should have everyone go to a bar and hang out.  [laughter] 

1:54 1:59 MALE: The whole four minutes during the middle of a conversation, you're finally getting to--and all of a sudden it's like--

1:58 2:00 FEMALE: Exactly.  Exactly. 

2:01 2:02 MALE: Nice talking to you.

2:00 2:05 FEMALE: And then you have to rate them which is also so hard and confusing.

2:07 2:07 MALE: [unintelligible] 

2:05 2:05 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:08 2:13 MALE: And I've actually gone back a couple of times where I read the-I skipped questions since I--

2:11 2:15 FEMALE: Exactly, exactly.  It's hard.  It's hard.

2:17 2:20 MALE: Yeah, yeah, I'm getting used to it.  So what do you do in education?

2:18 2:25 FEMALE: Um, I am in a masters program in policy and leadership so it's a new program this year. 

2:28 2:28 MALE: Cool.

2:26 2:32 FEMALE: Um, it's pretty cool.  It's--we're done in June.  It's just one year.  It's really, really fast.

2:35 2:37 MALE: So you're getting to the end of that light at the end of the tunnel?

2:34 2:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.

2:38 2:39 MALE: How does it feel to be almost done?

2:37 2:41 FEMALE: Well it's only nine months.  It's not so, so bad.  But it's pretty intensive.

2:44 2:45 MALE: [laughter] 

2:42 2:51 FEMALE: You know what I mean?  Since it's only nine months they cram a lot of stuff in there so it's been pretty busy.  But now I'm supposed to find a job on top of finishing my course work, so it's like--

2:54 2:54 MALE: [unintelligible] 

2:52 2:53 FEMALE: Yeah, exactly.

2:55 2:57 MALE: What are you looking to do?

2:55 3:02 FEMALE: Um, I'm hoping to stay in the Bay Area and then there's a lot of--there are a lot of avenues that I'm willing to take to do that.

3:04 3:05 MALE: So teaching, research--

3:03 3:16 FEMALE: No I'm not.  It's not a certification program.  It actually prepares me more to like support schools, either through working in a district office or there are a lot of non-profits that work directly with schools and districts to help them do their jobs better, so--

3:18 3:19 MALE: Oh right on.

3:16 3:19 FEMALE: I want to make them function better.

3:22 3:22 MALE: Cool.

3:20 3:20 FEMALE: I'll try.

3:23 3:23 MALE: They need that.

3:21 3:24 FEMALE: They do need that.  They need support, so--  Are you a doctoral student?

3:27 3:31 MALE: I am a masters student working towards my doctorate.  So we have to have our masters before they'll let us do a doctorate.

3:31 3:33 FEMALE: You finish that first?  And how long does that take?

3:36 3:37 MALE: I will finish in December.

3:35 3:35 FEMALE: Okay.

3:38 3:42 MALE: I know a few people doing it in a year.  I think they are both very dedicated and nuts.

3:41 3:42 FEMALE: [laughter]  I'm sure.

3:45 3:54 MALE: A uh--a guy I know just said, you know, there are three S's to grad school.  There's school work, social life, and sleep.  You only get to pick two.

3:52 3:54 FEMALE: Oh no.

3:56 4:00 MALE: And then one of the guys like, well what if I want to finish in a year.  Like, you don't get to pick any of them.

3:58 4:02 FEMALE: That's right.  [laughter] [horn] You get school work and that's what you get.  Oh my goodness.

4:05 4:06 MALE: Yeah, it was nice talking to you.

4:03 4:05 FEMALE: Nice talking to you.  Have fun.
