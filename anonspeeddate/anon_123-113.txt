0:05 0:26 FEMALE:  I just need a second.  Hi, male113.  female123.
0:02 0:02 MALE:  You just ripped it.
0:27 0:32 FEMALE:  But I--I just--you know, I'm a disaster.  So totally a disaster.
0:05 0:05 MALE:  Understandable.
0:33 0:35 FEMALE:  So how are--
0:12 0:12 MALE:  Are you wearing a scent?
0:35 0:36 FEMALE:  Am I what?
0:13 0:17 MALE:  Are you wearing a scent?  Well somebody is.
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Can you smell something?
0:19 0:20 MALE:  I smell, yeah, yeah, yeah, like perfume.
0:43 0:45 FEMALE:  Oh.  You must have like a killer nose.
0:24 0:30 MALE:  I don't know if I do.  But I kind of pay attention to like people's smells [unintelligible]  I don't know if that's weird or--
0:53 0:55 FEMALE:  Are you in perfumology at Stanford?
0:32 0:32 MALE:  No.  I'm an engineer.
0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  Oh, you act like a civil engineer.
0:35 0:35 MALE:  I'm an electrical engineer.
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  How's that going?
0:37 0:39 MALE:  It's pretty good.  I hope to be done soon.
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  Oh, you--what year are you?
0:41 0:41 MALE:  I'm a 5th year.
1:05 1:08 FEMALE:  Oh, people get their Engineer PHD so fast.
0:46 0:48 MALE:  [unintelligible] it'll take like six years overall.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  I have to do one more year, and then you're going to be done?
0:50 0:52 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Hopefully.
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  What are you going to do after?  Work?
0:54 0:59 MALE:  I hope to work for a company, find a job in the industry.  There's a lot of like exciting things going on.
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  And then the--
1:01 1:01 MALE:  Maybe return to school later, but.
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  Maybe return to school?
1:01 1:12 MALE:  It's like the academia to get like a faculty job.  But that's really in the future, you know.
1:35 1:44 FEMALE:  Um, is there a [unintelligible] premium for companies for people with PHD's and Engineering degrees rather than, say, somebody has a Master's or just like a [unintelligible]?
1:21 1:35 MALE:  It's harder to find a job, I would say. It definitely makes the pay higher, of course.  But, yeah, it's more like the kind of job that you can find.  I'm more into just doing like the research kind of RND, rather than like a product development kind of thing.
1:58 2:00 FEMALE:  Oh I see.  Okay.
1:37 1:38 MALE:  How about you?  What are you doing?
2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  I go to law school.
1:39 1:39 MALE:  Oh really?  Okay.
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:40 1:40 MALE:  Which year are you?
2:05 2:05 FEMALE:  First year.
1:42 1:45 MALE:  Okay.  How's that going?  That's like the hardest year, right?
2:08 2:08 FEMALE:  Supposedly.
1:46 1:46 MALE:  Really?
2:10 2:15 FEMALE:  But and we have finals.  I have my first finals in two weeks.  But whatever.
1:53 1:54 MALE:  Okay.  You're like laid back about it.
2:18 2:30 FEMALE:  You know, the reason why I came to Stanford is because it's a very laid back law school.  It's not as bad as the other law schools.  Like the East Coast law schools are ridiculous.  I mean, they work all these ridiculous hours, and people are really competitive.
2:08 2:08 MALE:  Oh, I didn't know that.  That's what I hear.
2:33 2:48 FEMALE:  There's a [unintelligible].  I mean, like, California's schools are just so much different from East Coast schools.  Like, they're--and it makes a difference for law school. I mean, all law schools are going to be stressful, because law schools are graded on a curve, the forced curve.  So I mean, it just makes everyone competitive with each other.
2:26 2:26 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah.
2:49 2:56 FEMALE:  Um, so.  But I mean, Stanford does a good job of minimizing it and building a community here.  Still, there are definitely a couple people here I definitely don't like.  Um.
2:34 2:37 MALE:  Oh yeah?  There's people like that no matter where you go, though.
3:01 3:04 FEMALE:  No.  That's true.  No, that's true.  So it's not that bad.
2:41 2:45 MALE:  So it's pretty much guaranteed that you graduate and find a nice job.
3:08 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, pretty much.  Uh, well I mean, it depends on what you mean by nice.  I mean, you can get a job that pays really well, but you're working, you know, 90 hours a week.
2:55 2:58 MALE:  Yeah.  Do you know what kind of stuff?
3:21 3:23 FEMALE:  Um, either I want to work for the government or enter academia.
3:01 3:01 MALE:  Okay.
3:25 3:25 FEMALE:  So we'll see.
3:03 3:06 MALE:  For government, is that like in a court or like a--
3:29 3:31 FEMALE:  Um, I want to be a U.S. Attorney, prosecute.
3:09 3:09 MALE:  Dang.
3:33 3:35 FEMALE:  I think it would be fun.  I think it would be really, really fun.
3:14 3:16 MALE:  That's ambition.  I'm marking you up in ambition. [laughter].
3:39 3:54 FEMALE:  [laughter] Well the great thing about it there's a lot of flexibility.  I mean, like one of the things that sucks about working in corporate law for a law firm is that you don't have a choice what you do.  And you end up, you know, defending [unintelligible] big, bad cigarette tobacco companies, asbestos companies, and you don't really have a choice whereas--
3:31 3:32 MALE:  You can follow your heart.
3:55 4:03 FEMALE:  Well I can do what I want to do.  There's flexibility.  There's discretion.  Uh, still a lot, a lot of [unintelligible].  But I don't know what's better.
3:40 3:40 MALE:  As long as you like it.
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:42 3:42 MALE:  It was good to meet you, female123.
4:06 4:06 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you too, male113.
