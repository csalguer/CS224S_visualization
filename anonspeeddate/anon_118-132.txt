0:44 0:47 MALE:  It was a good, uh, engineering school [unintelligible]

0:47 0:49 FEMALE:  So you're--and now you're and engineering [unintelligible] 

0:49 0:52 MALE:  I am actually not a PhD student.  I'm just a masters student.

1:48 1:50 MALE:  --trekking to and fro the engineering buildings every day.

1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  [laughter] 

1:52 1:54 MALE:  I'm sure you--it's the same for you and the engineering students.

1:54 2:05 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] I know quite a few engineering students because, um, yeah, I get around.  And so I had a boyfriend who [unintelligible] program--

2:05 2:05 MALE:  Oh wow.
