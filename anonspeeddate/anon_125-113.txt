00:43  	00:44  	MALE:  Wow, okay.

00:44  	00:50 	FEMALE:  Although I'm kind of -- I think I'll work in research for a little while and maybe [unintelligible] and go back and forth.

00:50  	00:57	MALE:  How do you research, like education, is that like educational methods or kind educational policy affects on people or?

00:58  	01:01  	FEMALE:  Um, well that's what I'm doing right now.  The latter of the two.

01:01  	01:02  	MALE:  Okay.

01:02  	01:17  	FEMALE:  And basically what it involves is a lot of classroom observation and talking to kids and teachers.  Um, doing lots and lots of interviews.  It's just a lot [unintelligible] obviously; I think it's a lot of [unintelligible] work as well.

01:18  	01:18  	MALE:  Wow.  

01:18  	01:21  	FEMALE:  It's a wide range.  How about you?  What are doing at Stanford?

01:23  	01:23  	MALE:  I'm an electrical engineer.

01:23  	01:24  	FEMALE:  Which part of engineering?

01:24  	01:24  	MALE:  Electrical.  

01:25	01:25	FEMALE:  Electrical, okay.

01:26	01:29	MALE:  Yeah.  Hoping to get out soon.  Get a real job.

01:30  	01:31 	FEMALE:  [laughter] are you getting your Masters or PhD?

01:31  	01:31  	MALE:   I'm PhD.  

01:32  	01:32  	FEMALE:  Okay.

01:33  	01:34  	MALE:  But I've been her for a while, I'm in my fifth year.

01:34  	01:35  	FEMALE:  Okay.  So you're almost finished.

01:35  	01:36  	MALE:  Yeah, theoretically [laughter].  

01:37  	01:54  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] dangerous question to ask anyone getting your PhD.  So are you finishing?  Finishing is a great answer, but it's just like for most people they'll  be like well, I feel like I'm moving in that direction and [unintelligible].

01:54  	01:56  	MALE:  Some people are just content to like do it forever. 

01:56	01:56	FEMALE:  Yeah, that's true.

01:57	02:02	MALE:  Kind of like a relatively low stress job insecure.  So in a way it's nice like that, but --.

02:02  	02:10  	FEMALE:  True.  Probably not as well paying as what you'll be doing after you actually have your PhD.

02:11  	02:11  	MALE:  Yeah, definitely, yeah.

02:12  	02:12  	FEMALE:  You know [unintelligible].

02:13  	02:14  	MALE:  I mean like --

02:14  	02:18  	FEMALE:  I mean like ever, engineering it's a little bit different thing.

02:19  	02:42  	MALE:  Yeah, it's a big difference.  I mean like I've gone to like shopping spree recently and I realized I think I need to make more money.  Like I think I need something that's high paying.  Like uh, yeah, I don't know why recently all the sudden I'm just thinking about buying everything.  Like I'm thinking about buying a new car too and so --

02:42  	02:43  	FEMALE:  So where are you from?

02:45  	02:45  	MALE:  So Cal.

02:46  	02:46  	FEMALE:  Southern California.

02:47  	02:48  	MALE:  Yeah.  How about yourself?

02:48  	02:50  	FEMALE:  I'm from the east coast actually.

02:50  	02:50  	MALE:  Oh really?  Where?

02:51 	02:52  	FEMALE:  Rochester, New York and Boston.

02:53	02:55  	MALE:  Okay.  I went to school at Princeton.

02:55	02:56	FEMALE:  Okay.

02:56	03:01	MALE:  So, that was my experience of the east coast is the really cold and I'm glad to be back in California.

03:01  	03:03  	FEMALE:  It's not as cold at Princeton as it is in Rochester.

03:04  	03:05  	MALE:  Yeah, yeah [laughter].

03:06  	03:10 	FEMALE:  No, but I'm actually [unintelligible] cold temperatures now.  I went -- I lived in Costa Rica for a year.

03:10  	03:11  	MALE:  Oh my gosh --

03:11  	03:12  	FEMALE:  I got back and I was like --

03:12  	03:13  	MALE:  Even better than here.

03:14  	03:17  	FEMALE:  This is insane, what am I doing in Boston.  So I came out to California.

03:18  	03:20  	MALE:  What were you doing there, that sounds really awesome?

03:20  	03:21  	FEMALE:  Um, I was a teacher actually.

03:22  	03:22  	MALE:  Okay.  

03:23  	03:24  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] at an elementary school.  

03:24  	03:27  	MALE:  So what class did you teach?

03:27  	03:29  	FEMALE: I taught English in two public schools.

03:29  	03:30  	MALE:  Okay.  I could have guessed that.

03:30  	03:52  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Well although, I mean I basically taught English but ended up teaching just about everything.  The schools that I was teaching in were really, really tiny, very rural communities.  The school principal was actually also a teacher.  So if she had to do something for school [unintelligible], those kids couldn't have a teacher. So half of time I would end up going in and like subbing the math class and also [unintelligible] --

03:52  	03:53  	MALE:  Oh, okay.

03:54  	04:03 	FEMALE:  [unintelligible], it was very amusing.  It's a very different relationship you have with student when they know that you're totally [unintelligible] [horn].  They hear you screwing up Spanish all the time.

04:03  	04:04  	MALE:  Oh no, oh no.

04:05  	04:09  	FEMALE:  It was fun though, I mean it was new for them, they got to teach music and so.  

04:11  	04:12  	MALE:  Yeah, cool.  Good meeting you.

04:12  	04:13  	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you too.

04:13  	04:14  	MALE:  Is it female125?

04:14  	04:14  	FEMALE:  female125, yeah.
