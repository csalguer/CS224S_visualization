0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:09 0:11 MALE:  So have you ever done these things?  
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  No.  
0:12 0:12 MALE:  I mean like--
0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I haven't done anything like this.  
0:14 0:16 MALE:  Me neither.  So, what's your program?  
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  I'm in education.  
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Okay.  
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  How about you?  
0:21 0:22 MALE:  I'm in physics.  
0:21 0:23 FEMALE:  Physics.  Oh, my parents are physicists.  
0:24 0:25 MALE:  Oh, really?  Both of them they are professors.  
0:25 0:28 FEMALE:  My mom isn't anymore, but yeah she was a PhD too.  
0:29 0:31 MALE:  Oh, wow.  That's impressive.  
0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  yeah.  
0:32 0:32 MALE:  What year are you?  
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  I'm a first-year doctoral. 
0:34 0:38 MALE:  Oh, okay, so you got [unintelligible].  Right?  
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.  How about you?  
0:39 0:40 MALE:  This is my third year?  
0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  Third year.  
0:41 0:47 MALE: So, I'll tell you what [unintelligible] is that they are [unintelligible] and obvious, you know.  
0:47 0:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's kind of nerve-wracking isn't it?  
0:50 0:55 MALE:  I know.  It's kind of oops, they are [unintelligible].  [laughter]  They are going to listen to this over and over again.  
0:55 0:55 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
0:57 0:58 MALE:  I know.  
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  But they're nice people.  
1:02 1:02 MALE:  Oh, yeah, they are.  
1:01 1:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:04 1:05 MALE:  And this is--
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  It's not going to be on the internet or anything.  
1:06 1:13 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  I know.  That's fine.  I think--I think this is going to be a lot of fun.  I didn't know there was going to be so many people.  
1:13 1:18 FEMALE:  Oh, I didn't either.  It's a lot of people.  So, where are you from?  
1:19 1:20 MALE:  I come from Spain.  
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Spain, oh.  
1:22 1:23 MALE:  Yeah, how about you?  
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  California.  
1:24 1:26 MALE:  Oh, where in California?  
1:25 1:28 FEMALE:  Below Sacramento.  It's a little bit east.  
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Okay.  
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:30 1:34 MALE:  Uh-huh.  So, you didn't have to go very far away, right?  
1:33 1:36 FEMALE:  Right.  But I've been living in Wisconsin.
1:38 1:38 MALE:  Oh, really?  
1:37 1:38 FEMALE:  So that's actually farther away.  
1:40 1:40 MALE:  Okay.  
1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  I did a Master's degree there.  
1:42 1:46 MALE:  Uh-huh. Okay.  So, how are you liking Stanford?  
1:46 1:52 FEMALE:  I like it.  It's different because I've been at like public universities before.  
1:53 1:54 MALE:  Oh, really? 
1:53 1:59 FEMALE:  And Stanford seems really like, I don't know, like kind of loyal students, you know.  
2:00 2:03 MALE:  In what sense?  I haven't started in the U.S. except for at Stanford.  
2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  Oh.
2:04 2:09 MALE:  So, in what sense do you think?  It's kind of easier for them to get good grades, or?  
2:09 2:25 FEMALE:  No, no, I think they have to work hard, but there are a lot of rich kids around.  And, you know, like there's a lot of I don't know like amenities for the students.  Where I went to school, you know, like we had very little interaction with professors or, you know.  
2:26 2:26 MALE:  Oh. 
2:26 2:27 FEMALE:  You know, because I went to a big public school.  
2:28 2:28 MALE:  Okay, okay.  
2:28 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, how do you find it compared to [unintelligible]?  
2:33 2:50 MALE:  So, I started in Spain.  It's so different, you know.  There's so much stuff going on, and this from many resources, you know.  That's for me, and the other difference is that in Spain I just went to the university and then came back home.  
2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:51 2:56 MALE:  And then you do your normal life.  But here all your life is around the university.  And I like that.  
2:55 2:56 FEMALE:  You do?  
2:57 3:11 MALE:  I do.  I mean you can decide to just go to your office and then go to the city or whatever.  But I like it that everything in my life is around the university.  So, when I heard about this dating thing--
3:10 3:10 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
3:11 3:13 MALE:  --I said, yeah, I'll do it.  Why not?  
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  Maybe you'll meet someone from the university, right?  
3:16 3:16 MALE:  Certainly that's another thing.  
3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:17 3:18 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  So, do you live on campus then?  
3:20 3:21 MALE:  Yeah, I do.  
3:20 3:31 FEMALE:  Yeah, I live off campus, and sometimes I feel like, uhm, not so much a part of the university, you know, which is one of the reasons I'm doing this because I thought--oh, I'll meet people, you know.  
3:32 3:41 MALE:  I think generally what happens is that people in the beginning want--I mean for me at least in the beginning I wanted to be all the time with [unintelligible] university-related.  
3:40 3:40 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:42 3:45 MALE:  But then it actually comes to the point that you want to move out.  
3:44 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:46 3:50 MALE:  But I mean still I want to have some [unintelligible] in the university and all that.  
3:50 4:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Did you have to--I know like in social sciences that European students get frustrated at American universities because in doctoral programs like in Europe you don't usually have to take classes.  
4:02 4:03 MALE:  Uh-huh, that's true.  
4:02 4:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, you just start your [unintelligible].  So, did you have to take classes here?  
4:06 4:07 MALE:  I did.  
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  And was that kind of weird for you?  
4:08 4:19 MALE:  Yeah, actually it was kind of weird because I had already taken so many classes in Europe, you know.  But I mean that's part of the program.  You have to go through that.  But it's fine.  
4:20 4:21 FEMALE:  It was really nice to meet you.  
4:22 4:23 MALE:  Yeah, very nice to meet you.  
4:22 4:23 FEMALE:  Okay, good luck.
4:24 4:25 MALE:  Okay, see you.
