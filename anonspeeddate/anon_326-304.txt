0:16 0:16 MALE: Okay.
0:24 0:25 FEMALE: [unintelligible].  What about you?
0:19 0:22 MALE: I don't know.  It sounded like something cool to do.  I signed up like last month, so.
0:30 0:30 FEMALE: Oh wow.
0:24 0:26 MALE: And I totally forgot about it until like yesterday when they emailed me.
0:32 0:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  So this is what it's kind of like.  Oh well, never done it before.  Give it a shot.
0:30 0:33 MALE: So you're the younger sister?  So when did you graduate?
0:41 0:42 FEMALE: Um, I'm a first year here.
0:36 0:43 MALE: You're a first year here?  Okay.  Me, too.  I graduated two years ago, and uh, I just came here for a master's.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE: What department?
0:45 0:45 MALE: E.
0:54 0:54 FEMALE: Mine's material science.
0:48 0:48 MALE: Material science?
0:55 0:55 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:49 0:50 MALE: Okay.  How do you like it so far?
0:58 1:09 FEMALE: It's okay.  I mean, I went--yeah, I went to MIT.  So it's kind of like the department here isn't--it's kind of the same thing all over again, just 'cause we learned a lot [unintelligible] MIT too.  It's kind of redundant.  The people are really nice. 
1:03 1:03 MALE: Yeah.
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  How about you?
1:05 1:08 MALE: Um, I like it a lot.  I like it--I went to Cal Tech for undergrad.  
1:15 1:15 FEMALE: Ooh [laughter].
1:10 1:12 MALE: And I feel like it's so much better here.  I was like damn, like--
1:19 1:19 FEMALE: I can relax [laughter].
1:13 1:16 MALE: Like people are nicer.  Yeah, the work's not as hard.  It's really something--
1:21 1:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  Social.
1:17 1:20 MALE: --compared to there.  So I had a good time.  Yeah. 
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: Cal Tech is small, right?
1:21 1:25 MALE: Yeah.  It's like a thousand people.  So like everyone [laughter]--everybody knows everyone.
1:33 1:33 FEMALE: A thousand people total?
1:27 1:33 MALE: A thousand people total.  So like you know everyone from every year, so like, if you see someone that's not from campus, you can like point it out [unintelligible].
1:40 1:41 FEMALE: You're like, what are you doing here [laughter]?
1:34 1:38 MALE: Yeah.  So like here, you know, it's so relaxed.  I don't know how to deal with that kind of stuff.
1:45 1:46 FEMALE: That's really scary [laughter].
1:41 1:44 MALE: I guess.  Yeah.  Did you, did you consider going there or--at all or? 
1:51 1:56 FEMALE: Um, I did not apply actually.  I thought MIT was kind of pretty much as hard core as I was willing to go--
1:50 1:50 MALE: Yeah.  There you go.
1:58 2:01 FEMALE: --into the engineering.  And it was still pretty scary, so.  Yeah.
1:57 1:57 MALE: Did you like Boston?  Or do you like it here better? 
2:04 2:09 FEMALE: Oh I love Boston.  I'm from this area, so kind of coming back was like, awesome.
2:02 2:3 MALE: Okay.  That's good.
2:11 2:19 FEMALE: So but um, Boston was really fun, just kind of for the four years when you're kind of a college kid, you can go run around and be with a million other college kids.  It's a good time.  Where are you from?
2:13 2:13 MALE: I'm from New York City.
2:21 2:21 FEMALE: Oh.
2:14 2:16 MALE: I'm from, uh, Brooklyn, like the southern part of Brooklyn.
2:23 2:24 FEMALE: Did you go to [unintelligible]?
2:17 2:18 MALE: Yeah.  How'd you know?
2:26 2:27 FEMALE: Everybody I meet comes from [unintelligible] [laughter].

2:35 2:35 FEMALE: That's really funny.
2:29 2:34 MALE: Yeah.  But um, yeah, it's just so weird like going back and seeing [unintelligible] from [unintelligible], so. 
2:42 2:42 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:35 2:40 MALE: I don't know.  I'm not too close to a lot of people there.  But um, a lot of the people I grew up with I'm more close with.
2:48 2:49 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.
2:44 2:44 MALE: I think. [unintelligible].

2:51 2:51 MALE: Yeah.
2:59 3:01 FEMALE: It's so cheap [laughter].  And it gets you there pretty fast.
2:55 2:57 MALE: I actually worked in Boston for like two years before this.
3:05 3:06 FEMALE: Oh really?  Where did you work?
2:59 3:00 MALE: At a [unintelligible] laboratory.
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: Oh [unintelligible].

3:20 3:23 FEMALE: Yeah.  Were you working on semi-conductor [unintelligible]?
3:16 3:20 MALE: No.  It's more like radars and stuff, but like, you know, just random electronic stuff.
