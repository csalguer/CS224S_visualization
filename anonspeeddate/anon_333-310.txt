0:18 0:19 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:21 0:22 MALE: Wow, time flies.
0:21 0:29 FEMALE: It pretty much does, yes, it seems, yeah.  Always- always I feel like I've been here forever, and like both really short and both really long.  So, it's hard to say.  
0:30 0:33 MALE: Long, yeah.  I've been here ten years and it seems like--
0:31 0:31 FEMALE: Really?
0:33 0:37 MALE: And who can- who can tell, it was just like, they think you're American, and you're like "That's it."  
0:34 0:35 FEMALE: Right, right.  Yeah.
0:38 0:39 MALE: It's cool, so what are you doing at Stanford?
0:38 0:40 FEMALE: I am an M.D./Ph.D. student, so medicine and neuroscience.
0:42 0:42 MALE: M.D./Ph.D.
0:41 0:45 FEMALE: Yeah.  [laughter]  No.  
0:47 0:48 MALE: Talk about smart.
0:46 0:52 FEMALE: No, no, not necessarily, just talk about how I'm willing to stay in school for a long time.  [laughter]  
0:51 0:52 MALE: Unless you're really good at-- 
0:53 0:59 FEMALE: It's-- maybe if I were really smart I'd be out there actually making money and you know, having more free time.  But you know.
1:01 1:03 MALE: Yeah.  How long does that program take?
1:01 1:03 FEMALE: Probably eight years.
1:05 1:05 MALE: Eight years.
1:03 1:09 FEMALE: I mean, Ph.D. really can be flexible, but I would say probably four years, so then med school's four years, so eight total.
1:11 1:14 MALE: So is that what you came here for initially?  So you [unintelligible]
1:11 1:13 FEMALE: Um, I did my undergrad here, too, so--
1:15 1:16 MALE: Oh, okay, [unintelligible]
1:13 1:17 FEMALE: So, total I will be here for 12 years or so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:18 1:21 MALE: At Stanford.  Don't want to leave this place.  How'd you want to leave this place, 'cause I don't want to leave.
1:19 1:21 FEMALE: I know, exactly, why would you want to leave?  [laughter]
1:22 1:25 MALE: Like I'm [unintelligible], like can I [unintelligible] my MBA.
1:23 1:23 FEMALE: What are you doing now?
1:26 1:27 MALE: I'm doing my MBA.
1:25 1:25 FEMALE: Okay.
1:27 1:28 MALE: And so I'm in my second, my second year.
1:26 1:28 FEMALE: Awesome.  That's cool.  
1:30 1:33 MALE: Um, a few more weeks to graduate, which sucks, but-- 
1:31 1:34 FEMALE: It's your second year?  So MBA is two years?  I thought it was three.
1:35 1:37 MALE: It's a two year program, yeah, no it's a two year, yeah.
1:35 1:37 FEMALE: Really?  Intriguing.
1:39 1:40 MALE: Two year program.  But mostly they are, so that's kind of nice.
1:39 1:41 FEMALE: That's cool.  Do you already have a job lined up and whatnot?  
1:43 1:46 MALE: Yeah, I do.  I do, I'm going to go work for, gonna go with Cisco Systems.
1:44 1:46 FEMALE: Okay, yeah, I've heard of them.
1:48 1:50 MALE: They're down here.  And um, so I'm glad about that, I want to like stay in the area.  It's nice.
1:48 1:48 FEMALE: That's cool.
1:51 1:51 MALE: Yeah.  
1:49 1:50 FEMALE: Very nice.
1:53 1:56 MALE: I love this this town.  What do you like best about this place?  Compared to home, for example.
1:54 2:02 FEMALE: Well, to be completely honest, given that I've only lived here, out of all the United States, it's not like I really have much to compare it to otherwise, but I just really like it.  I like the-- 
2:04 2:05 MALE: But compare home, like--
2:03 2:06 FEMALE: Compared to home?  Oh.  
2:08 2:09 MALE: 'Cause I've never been.  
2:07 2:27 FEMALE: So Croatia, I mean, I like the fact that people are here much more willing-- I mean, this is very more also United States versus Croatia defense, but like in Croatia like things are much more like, "Choose a career path and then do that, and then if you hate it, sorry you got to stick with it, that's it."  You know, like here, I think people are much more like, "Hello, I did poetry, and then I think now I'll do my MBA."  
2:29 2:31 MALE: Find what's interesting to you, yeah.  That's awesome.
2:27 2:42 FEMALE: You know, and do something like that, you know, like exactly, so there's more fluidity.  I love the weather.  I just like the people, people are kind of like, both really smart but also laid back, or at least pretend to be laid back.  They're kind of probably everyone's like, you know, really working hard on the surface, but keeping it cool, which is nice.  So, I like it.
2:42 2:53 MALE: Yeah.  Well, actually, I totally relate with that because one of my friends, I remember first quarter, she was like, "Ty, you're so calm all the time," I'm like, "Are you kidding me?  Like you just don't see me when I'm in my room."
2:51 2:54 FEMALE: [laughter] Right.  When I'm stressed out, I stay at home.  
2:55 3:00 MALE: I'm just like, "What the hell is going on?" You kn ow, like trying to figure stuff out and like I'm studying, like--
2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Exactly.
3:01 3:02 MALE: --you're just so calm, [unintelligible]
3:00 3:00 FEMALE: [laughter]
3:03 3:04 MALE: Yeah, don't buy it.  
3:03 3:05 FEMALE: That's awesome.  Wow.
3:06 3:09 MALE: No, [unintelligible], no yeah, so it's interesting.  So what-- ?
3:06 3:09 FEMALE: That's really-- what do you like about it?  Stanford?  Same things, or-- ?
3:12 3:17 MALE: You know, the school itself, what I like about the school overall, the business school I love, I love about this.
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:18 3:22 MALE: The school stuff, what I love is the fact that I can go like rollerblading around this campus.
3:20 3:20 FEMALE: Right.
3:23 3:26 MALE: And you know, without worrying about cars, without worrying about any of the stuff.  
3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Right, right.
3:27 3:28 MALE: And it's just, just so beautiful.  You know?
3:26 3:27 FEMALE: I know, it's beautiful, it is.  
3:29 3:32 MALE: And you just find different spots with beautiful views.
3:30 3:31 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:33 3:38 MALE: So I like that, I like it, it's kind of sereen the way that you can just sit down and think and different things, and relax.
3:36 3:36 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:39 3:41 MALE: Um, the business school I love, because you got to-- 
3:39 3:51 FEMALE: Right, so like what's you take on it?  Because like I heard from someone, you know, some people, that oh, it's so easy, like it's all about networking, and then I've had some, one person claim there is actually is work, and they do do work, damnit, and I'm like, "Really?"
3:51 3:55 MALE: It's a lot of work.  We- we work hard, but we play very hard.
3:53 3:54 FEMALE: Okay, so--
3:56 3:58 MALE: So we probably play harder than most others.
3:56 4:03 FEMALE: So like the play to difficulty working ratio is still skewed much more towards play, but-- 
[horn]
4:03 4:04 MALE: Not really.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE: Okay.  [laughter]
4:05 4:09 MALE: I mean, it's almost a balance, more skewed towards like, there's a lot of work.  
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: That's cool.
4:09 4:10 MALE: Especially the first year.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE: Cool.  Well, nice meeting you.
4:12 4:12 MALE: It's real nice meeting you.  I'll see you.
4:11 4:12 FEMALE: And your name is nameX, right?
4:13 4:13 MALE: nameX.
4:12 4:12 FEMALE: Yeah.
