00:01  	00:04  	FEMALE:  [horn] [laughter]

00:05  	00:13  	MALE:  [horn] Hi.

00:13  	00:13  	MALE:  Hi.

00:15	00:15  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] we're up -- 

00:15  	00:16  	MALE:  Can I see your nametag?

00:17  	00:18  	FEMALE:  We're not talking yet.  Aren't we supposed to be on break?

00:18  	00:19  	MALE:  Okay.

00:19  	00:20  	FEMALE:  Oh, my name? 

00:21  	00:21	MALE:  Okay.

00:22	00:24  	FEMALE:  I thought you were trying to cheat [laughter].

00:24 	00:25	MALE:  Well it doesn't matter because it will be longer you know.

00:25  	00:28	FEMALE:  [laughter]

00:29  	00:31	MALE:  Generally it's proven that people decide within the first two minutes [laughter].  

00:32  	00:33	FEMALE:  Ah-huh.  So, --

00:34  	00:35  	MALE:  [unintelligible] conclude [laughter].

00:35  	00:47  	FEMALE:  I was talking to -- well I was at a meeting today, it was just a lunch meeting, a girl was telling me she's reading this book about impulse decisions and do you know at the end of quarter review people do for professors.    

00:48  	00:48	MALE:  Ah-huh.

00:48  	01:11  	FEMALE:  The answers they give at the quarter is almost identical to the answers they give after sitting in a class for a month.  Okay so they did this whole quarter, a month like a week, a day and then get this they would let the people watch the professor with no sound.  And they would -- within 30 seconds and they get the same rating as if they had done gone to the class the whole --

01:11  	01:11	MALE:  But where was this taken [unintelligible] at the end?

01:12  	01:13	FEMALE:  Have you ever taken the end of the quarter survey?

01:14  	01:18  	MALE:  Oh, on the professors and all that.   So the people decide after the first few seconds.  

01:18  	01:20	FEMALE:   [unintelligible].

01:21  	01:21  	MALE:  Oh my gosh.

01:22	01:23  	FEMALE:  How well do they understand the materials [laughter]?

01:24  	01:24  	MALE:  [laughter].

01:25  	01:26  	FEMALE:  And the thing is they can't hear the audio.

01:27  	01:34  	MALE:   [laughter] that's funny, that's a really interesting study.  So what's your program?  I find that so interesting [laughter].  So what's you're program?

01:34  	01:35  	FEMALE:  Electrical Engineering.

01:36  	01:40  	MALE:  Okay, so I thought you were in education, like pretty much like education are staying. 

01:42  	01:51  	FEMALE:  Well, man, it makes me wonder I kind imagine what everyone would be -- like if you could hear what they were doing for 30 seconds to decide about them.

01:51  	01:53  	MALE:  I know, I know.  Oh my god, you must have a really good impression [unintelligible].

01:53  	01:58  	FEMALE:  So give me an impression of the beginning of our date?  And I can fill out your paper.

02:02  	02:06  	MALE:  [laughter], good.  So, how long have you been at Stanford?

02:17  	02:18  	MALE:  Oh no thanks. [Background noise - mic]

02:26  	02:30  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible], because that didn't count.

02:31  	02:32  	MALE:  [laughter].

02:32  	02:36  	FEMALE:  Otherwise you're going to have to put like ten minutes for the time.

02:37  	02:42  	MALE:  Yeah.  Well you can put that if you want, I mean if it takes you [unintelligible] put that.

02:43  	02:48  	FEMALE:  You know the first guy I met was really cool and I went back [unintelligible].

02:49  	02:54  	MALE:  That's happened to me in fact, I'm changing circles here [laughter].  You know it's funny.

02:55  	02:59  	FEMALE:  Um [horn].  Okay.  

02:59  	03:00  	MALE:  Okay.  So, what's your name?

03:00  	03:01  	FEMALE:  My name is female126.

03:01  	03:04  	MALE:  Hi, nice to meet you [laughter].  So [unintelligible] first time?

03:07  	03:09  	FEMALE:  Never before in my life.

03:09	03:10	MALE:  Oh my gosh, that's so bad.

03:10	03:10	FEMALE:  What about you?

03:11  	03:13  	MALE:  Oh me neither.

03:14  	03:17  	FEMALE:  What is that the fact that we're doing it now?

03:17  	03:17  	MALE:  No, I was just teasing you.

03:18  	03:20  	FEMALE:  Oh.

03:20  	03:22  	MALE:  Because then I [unintelligible] you know, that was a joke [laughter].

03:23  	03:23  	FEMALE:  [laughter].

03:25  	03:37  	MALE:  I think that's a very Stanford thing this speed dating thing.  I've [unintelligible], but I never done and it's a lot of fun.

03:37  	03:39  	FEMALE:  It's totally different than what I thought it was going to be.

03:39  	03:50  	MALE:  Me too.

03:40  	03:50  	FEMALE:  I sort of imagined everyone in sort of sitting at desks [unintelligible] and you know.  Hi, my name is female126.  I'm tired [unintelligible]. 

03:50  	03:51  	MALE:  Oh my god, are you tired yet?

03:51  	03:53  	FEMALE:  No, but I kind of imagined that it would be --

03:54  	04:01  	MALE:  Well I thought it would be at a very long table and we would be one next to the other and you would be listening to each other's conversations. 

04:01  	04:05  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'd be thinking person is a lot more interesting than that.

04:05  	04:12  	MALE:  [unintelligible] that's what I was thinking it as.  [unintelligible] conversation next to you was more interesting and then you can think, um --

04:12  	04:16  	FEMALE:  Yeah and listen not devoting your full attention. Kind of like --

04:17  	04:20  	MALE:  [laughter] exactly.  Yeah I had those thoughts.

04:22  	04:30  	FEMALE:  Well, ah I [unintelligible] you clearly but can't hear their conversations. 

04:30  	04:33  	MALE: Me neither.  I mean [unintelligible] [laughter].

04:34  	04:40 	FEMALE:  Well, I'll know I'm really boring if all the sudden you're leaning over and I'm like [laughter].

04:41  	04:46  	MALE:  I know.  So -- so how do you like Stanford?

04:46  	04:47  	FEMALE:  It's growing on me.

04:47  	04:48  	MALE:  Its growing on you what does that mean?

04:49	04:51	FEMALE:  I didn't used to like it but now I'm --

04:52	04:52	MALE:  Oh same for me when I came.

04:52	04:54	FEMALE:  Well it was so hard for me to met people.

04:55	04:55	MALE:  I know.

04:55	05:22	FEMALE:  So for the whole first quarter I really hated it, because I just didn't know anyone.  And then I found a small group of friends and I'm sort of through them I've met other people so I have this one core group of friends and then I know their friends.  So I sort have this large number -- or a moderate number of acquaintances now.  And so recognizing that has helped.  What was it -- what was it that you didn't like about Stanford?

05:22	05:42	MALE:  Oh, several things.  So that was one of the things.  The other thing is that I come from Spain and there -- I mean from a very lively city.  And then you come here I was [unintelligible] didn't have a car.  I knew so few people and then it was so boring.  Because I was working very hard and I just needed a break.  

05:42	05:42	FEMALE:  Yeah.

05:42	05:49	MALE:  And I mean I couldn't take a real break, you know?  I went to some girls parties, but you know I don't want to discriminate against [unintelligible].

05:49	05:52	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

05:52	05:59	MALE:  Exactly. Exactly.  Because you just get in a room they turn around they ignore and you know it's very weird

05:59	06:01	FEMALE: Yeah.  [unintelligible].

06:02	06:07	MALE:  You know but then you end up making friends and knowing the culture and I'm loving it in time.  

06:08	06:09	FEMALE:  So how long have you been here?

06:09	06:10	MALE:  Two and a half years.

06:11	06:12	FEMALE:  Okay.  And so how long -- I mean when did you start liking it?

06:13	06:22	MALE:  Actually pretty late, it took me more than one year just to start liking it.  It's growing on me [laughter] as you say.

06:22	06:23	FEMALE:  So do you have a car now?

06:24	06:24	MALE:  I do.

06:24	06:29	FEMALE:  What do you like I mean -- when you escape, where do you go when you leave? Do you leave Stanford.  Where do you go?  

06:30	06:35	MALE:  So the other day I went to Berkeley.  Have you been?

06:35	06:39	FEMALE:  No, I haven't had the Berkeley experience.

06:40	06:41	MALE:  Oh, you'd like it -- [unintelligible] needing your Berkeley experience.

06:41	06:52	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I went there to -- a professor from my undergrad who is doing a sabbatical there.  So I went and met him for dinner one night.  But, because I went after work and just drove up --

06:53	06:53	MALE:  Well at least you know how it looks like, right?

06:54	06:54	FEMALE:  Yeah.

06:55	06:55	MALE:  It's better than nothing.

06:56	07:00	FEMALE:  I plan to go back some day maybe on a weekend and spend some real time there.

07:01	07:04	MALE:  You should.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was there to a party [horn] it was very nice.

07:05	07:05	FEMALE:  Ah. 

07:07	07:07	MALE:  Well, nice to meet you.

07:07	07:08	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
