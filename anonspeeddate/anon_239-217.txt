0:43 0:44 MALE:  Oh, you're an ME.
0:44 0:49 FEMALE:  Yes, I'm an ME.  I did my background in ME, but product design is different in uh.
0:49 0:51 MALE:  Is it like art with ME?
0:50 0:55 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's like a very specific major.  It's like, it's like a, there's only like 15 of us or something.
0:55 0:59 MALE:  So it depends on the product design.  And I mean in the, on the ME department, doesn't it?
0:59 1:01 FEMALE:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, I'll get a degree from mechanical engineering.
1:00 1:01 MALE:  Okay, okay.
1:01 1:02 FEMALE:  Well, what about you?
1:02 1:03 MALE:  I'm in Aloastrom [phonetic].

1:04 1:05 MALE:  Em, Aloastrom.
1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
1:06 1:13 MALE:  Aloastrom.  But I'm really sure if people from product design because they, I took a bunch of ME classes.  I took ME through 18 classes, you know.
1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  Oh, well yeah, that's by  product design.
1:14 1:15 MALE: Are you taking that one, or?
1:15 1:18 FEMALE:  It's not really my, my uh...
1:17 1:22 MALE:  Required? Oh, you don't want to do roads or [unintelligible] crawling spiders or animals?
1:23 1:32 FEMALE:  No, I'm uh, kind of more of a fun products, like not so, not so techy [phonetic].  But, I think it's interesting I just don't know if I have the time to take that class.
1:32 1:33 MALE:  Uh-huh.
1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  Like, if I take it, it will be next year.  Are you graduating?
1:34 1:42 MALE:  Okay.  No, well, in five year, I'm finishing soon.  So, the thing is that class takes a lot of your life [laughter].
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  I know.
1:42 1:45 MALE:  You got, the years that we spend, you know, in the lab.
1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:46 2:04 MALE:  So, anyway, it's a lot of fun.  But you said you like, like robotics and electronics and making and constructing gadgets.  Some of the, probably same people take it because they use it later on to build things.  You know, and I know this girl who ended up working like in a, in a museum building dinosaurs.
2:04 2:05 FEMALE:  [laughter]
2:05 2:08 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that's pretty cool, you know.  So you never know, right?
2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's true.
2:09 2:11 MALE:  So, so what kind of product design you want to do?
2:11 2:20 FEMALE:  Um, well, I'm kind of more into the smaller consumer products like fun stuff that make people, uh, that, that are amusing.
2:20 2:21 MALE:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
2:21 2:25 FEMALE:  Like, um, like, well, or useful, you know.  I'm kind of not the biotech kind of girl.
2:26 2:28 MALE:  Like gadgets?  Like, like uh...
2:28 2:30 FEMALE:  Uh, yeah, like right now I'm doing like wet weather bicycle gear.
2:31 2:32 MALE:  Oh, really?
2:31 2:34 FEMALE:  So I'm focusing on the needs of people who ride in the rain.
2:35 2:36 MALE:  Okay, okay.
2:35 2:44 FEMALE:  And there's so many needs and like, so I'm just making a whole bunch of products for that.  And uh, whether it's like helping with your hands or your feet or your seat and so...
2:42 2:46 MALE:  Okay, like practical stuff that nobody thought about before.
2:45 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, but it's not like, not high tech really, but it's useful, so, um, just a lot of other fun little things.
2:51 2:53 MALE:  Yeah, well and those little things that's where the beauty is.
2:53 2:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, I like that.  I don't want to make things that could hurt somebody or.
2:58 3:01 MALE:  You know the other day I went to this; do you know about the Coop Brothers' expo?
3:01 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, I didn't get to go to there.
3:03 3:28 MALE:  Oh it, you, if you are here next year you have to go.  So I, I saw this product, which is like, they call it the Fair Cylinder.  So it's this thing which is like a, it's like a cylinder mixed with a, with a sphere so they use it for um, for this sphere here in the middle.  So they use this for, you know when, when you take something apart they turn out products that it seems like it never fits when you try to put it back you know?
3:28 3:29 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:29 3:40 MALE:  So, so some part, let's say your hot plate you know, and they had like three like little, like a dots or knots, you know and the other side has like three screws or something.  So it fits perfectly right?
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
3:41 3:55 MALE:  And usually they use like a spheres or like some sort of circular shape to make this sphere.  And they come up with this because they think it'll hold more or stretch or something.  The thing is that, this is not new.  I mean, they could have designed this like 100 years ago, right?
3:55 3:56 FEMALE:  Right.
3:55 3:58 MALE: But they just came up with it like, like one year ago, right.
3:57 3:59 FEMALE: Alright exactly, that's what I like, that kind of stuff.
3:59 4:02 MALE:  You see.  Nobody thought about it before.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  That's so funny.
4:03 4:07 MALE:  Yeah.  So I'm sure you're going to come up with something new that nobody else is hoping for.
4:06 4:09 FEMALE:  Exactly, look for me next year in, in the Product Design Expo.
4:09 4:11 MALE:  Absolutely, are you going to do your PhD or?
4:11 4:13 FEMALE:  Uh, no just masters for now, but.
4:13 4:14 MALE: And then go for the big bucks huh?
4:14 4:17 FEMALE:  Who knows?  Yeah.  It was good meeting you male217 Esquire.
