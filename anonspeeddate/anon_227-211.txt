1:40 2:01 FEMALE:  I'm in the non-profit management program so I'm gonna find something in that arena but I haven't really narrowed down what I want to do.  So I basically want to travel over the summer and you know, make the most of my two years off from you know, work before I have to go back.
2:01 2:05 MALE:  [unintelligible] and then go back to [unintelligible].
2:05 2:17 FEMALE:  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all -- you get -- you go to business school, and I guess you write your applications, you sound like you really know what you want to do and then you realize by your second year you have no idea what you want to do and -

2:42 2:53 FEMALE:  I was in Richmond for one year and then I was in D.C. for the rest of the time, right outside of D.C., so.  Richmond was a little too small for me.  I like a bigger city, so.
2:54 2:59 MALE:  [unintelligible] it didn't seem like there was much there.
2:59 3:05 FEMALE:  Well, the whole town is Capital One basically so, you can't get away from that pretty much.
