2:07 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:08 2:16 MALE:  Like improv, [unintelligible] in a gym and I sadly don't really do music anymore, but that used to be like something I did all the time.

2:18 2:21 MALE:  Um, I'm just, you know, normal stuff like hang out with friends and traveling and stuff like that.

2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:22 2:23 MALE:  What about you?

2:23 2:30 FEMALE:  Um, I'm really into cooking [unintelligible] food and wine.  I mean, I love to cook I love to eat [unintelligible] pretty much any type of food especially Thanksgiving.

2:30 2:30 MALE:  Yeah.

2:30 2:32 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] big roasts and things like that.

2:32 2:33 MALE:  Pig roasts?

2:33 2:33 FEMALE:  Huh?

2:34 2:34 MALE:  Pig roasts?

2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  No, big roasts.

2:35 2:35 MALE:  Oh, big roasts.

2:36 2:51 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  I love to travel.  I really don't [unintelligible] I'm a big Raider and 49er fan and I love baseball.  I went to [unintelligible] UCLA as an under grad and I really enjoyed UCLA.

2:51 2:51 MALE:  [unintelligible] yeah.

2:52 2:55 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] so it's just [unintelligible] can be really good.  [laughter].

2:56 3:00 MALE:  Yeah, see I don't watch much sports so I don't know.  Do you play much sports as well?

3:01 3:24 FEMALE:  Uh, I try.  I do play a little [unintelligible] I think [unintelligible] an under grad anymore, um, so I run, I run about 15 miles a week and I try to work out as much as I can to the extent that [unintelligible] that the business school [unintelligible] has been having [unintelligible] and stuff like that I'll play.  And then I think when I get back to--I played soccer for 15 years when I was growing up, so I'm going to try and get on [unintelligible] soccer team when I move back to San Francisco.  [unintelligible].

3:24 3:28 MALE:  Nice.  How do you have time?  I guess--well, you'll have more time whenever you're--

3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Yeah, it sounds like [unintelligible].

3:29 3:29 MALE:  --working.

3:30 3:43 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] time consuming [unintelligible].  So, yeah [unintelligible].  I don't know, it--I enjoyed that relationship [unintelligible] so it's just a priority for me.  I'm sacrificing my grades [unintelligible].

3:43 3:43 MALE:  Um-hum.

3:44 3:45 FEMALE:  So, I'm getting--

3:45 3:51 MALE:  Well, that's a good way to do it because it's kind of like these are some of the important years of your life.  Like, well, really every years of your life is important, but, I mean--

3:52 4:01 FEMALE:  My goal is to get a degree in [unintelligible].  And I think--[unintelligible] to get my masters, so [unintelligible].  And I think [unintelligible].

4:01 4:02 MALE:  I can understand that.

4:02 4:05 FEMALE:  --[unintelligible] and I think of the [unintelligible] school and the business school they are [unintelligible], so all of us hang out.  [laughter].

4:06 4:10 MALE:  Well, I mean, like, business--like, I never heard of business school being the kind of place where you're supposed to like try to be top of your class.

4:11 4:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, you know, there's very little incentive they have a grade non-disclosure policy, so you're not allowed to tell recruiters [unintelligible] what your grades are.

4:17 4:17 MALE:  Well, that's really nice.

4:18 4:18 FEMALE:  So--

4:19 4:21 MALE:  Wait, you're not allowed to tell recruiters if you want to?

4:22 4:26 FEMALE:  I mean, I guess you could if you wanted to, but it's sort of--it's a--it's a school norm that people don't.

4:26 4:31 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Huh.  I always thought it was going to be like they're not allowed to ask you or something like that.

4:31 4:32 FEMALE:  They are not allowed to ask you.

4:32 4:33 MALE:  Okay.  Interesting.

4:33 4:36 FEMALE:  And you're not--in theory I [unintelligible].

4:36 4:39 MALE:  Yeah.  Well, nice meeting you.

4:39 4:40 FEMALE:  Take care.

4:40 4:40 MALE:  Thanks.
