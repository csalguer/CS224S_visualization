0:27 0:28 MALE: Only one year actually?

0:28 0:33 FEMALE: Because um, I think they know that people in education are probably not going to make a lot of money-- [laughter]

0:35 0:37 MALE: Won't be able to pay back.  [laughter] 

0:34 0:38 FEMALE: --when we get out, yeah, so most um, education programs across the country are one year.

0:40 0:41 MALE: Right, right, right.

0:40 0:41 FEMALE: It's kind of a sad statement.

0:42 0:44 MALE: Yeah, I didn't know that actually.

0:44 0:45 FEMALE: Unfortunately it's true. [laughter] 

0:46 0:47 MALE: Right, right.

0:46 0:53 FEMALE: But I hope, since I'm looking for a job right now I hope I can find something that's a little bit better than usual but we'll see.

0:54 0:56 MALE: What kind of job are you looking for?

0:56 1:06 FEMALE: I'm hoping to stay in San Francisco and it's a policy program so there are a lot of non-profits that support school districts, and schools, and--

1:08 1:08 MALE: Right.

1:07 1:12 FEMALE: --trying to make them function better, and do programs, and stuff like that.  So yeah.  So we'll see.

1:14 1:14 MALE: I see.

1:22 1:24 FEMALE: So you love this weather then, right?

1:25 1:27 MALE: Yeah, absolutely.  [laughter] 

1:26 1:30 FEMALE: So you've got lots of years ahead of you in your life. So are you ready?   

1:31 1:32 MALE: I hope so, yeah.  [laughter] 

1:32 1:33 FEMALE: [laughter] Excellent.  That's great.

1:34 1:41 MALE: It's kind of unusual not to have snow in winter, you know.  It takes me a while to kind of get used to it.

1:38 1:44 FEMALE: I'm sure.  Did you go to um, undergraduate in the States or no, you came from--you came from Russia to come here?

1:46 1:48 MALE: No actually I did my undergraduate in Moscow.

1:47 1:47 FEMALE: You did?

1:49 1:55 MALE: Yeah, and then I left for Germany.  And then I lived--well I spent almost two years in Germany.

1:54 1:54 FEMALE: Uh huh.

1:56 1:57 MALE: And then I lived a little bit in Switzerland.

1:56 1:57 FEMALE: Uh huh.

1:58 2:00 MALE: And then I stayed for three years in England.

1:59 2:00 FEMALE: Uh huh.

2:01 2:03 MALE: And then I came over.  It was a long trip.

2:02 2:06 FEMALE: Oh exactly, it is a long trip.  A well traveled man.

2:07 2:08 MALE: [laughter] 

2:06 2:16 FEMALE: That's great.  That's great.  Wow.  That's interesting.  That's interesting to come all this way.  I mean, there are so many international students here.  

2:17 2:18 MALE: Yeah, yeah.

2:16 2:22 FEMALE: It's really, real exciting.  It makes it a really interesting place to be--meet a lot of different people.

2:23 2:24 MALE: Have you traveled a lot?

2:24 2:39 FEMALE: Um, yeah my last job before I came here, I worked for a curriculum development company.  We wrote curriculum for students, younger students, and they tracked a sailboat going around the world, so I got to live on the boat.  So I sailed--

2:40 2:40 MALE: Oh really?

2:39 2:44 FEMALE: Yeah, so I sailed from Australia to New York, um, took 20 months to do it.

2:45 2:47 MALE: That's like a dream job. [laughter] 

2:45 3:00 FEMALE: So it is a dream job.  Except it was a leaky small boat.  So there were four people [laughter] so it was like, you know.  But I got to go to so many places that I would never have gotten to visit otherwise, so it was really a  good adventure.

3:02 3:04 MALE: Wow, wow.  I envious.

3:01 3:07 FEMALE: Yeah, but I've never been to Russia.  [laughter] The boat didn't quite make it there. [laughter] 

3:07 3:08 MALE: Oh yeah. [laughter] 

3:08 3:12 FEMALE: Somehow.  Exactly, exactly.  Yeah.  But I would love to go.

3:13 3:16 MALE: Yeah, I think now is the kind of-it's a good time to go visit.

3:16 3:17 FEMALE: This time of year?

3:18 3:18 MALE: Um--

3:18 3:19 FEMALE: Or this time right now?

3:20 3:25 MALE: This time right now.  And also, I mean, the summer is probably the best season to go.

3:24 3:24 FEMALE: Uh huh.

3:26 3:28 MALE: And yeah, Moscow and St. Petersburg as well.

3:28 3:28 FEMALE: Uh huh.
