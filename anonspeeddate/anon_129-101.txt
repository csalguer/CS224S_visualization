1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:07 1:08 MALE:  [unintelligible] to do more--the number one is biology.  
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  So, what do you do?
1:10 1:11 MALE:  I do magnetic materials.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE: Magnetic materials?  
1:13 1:13 MALE: Yeah.

1:43 1:49 FEMALE: Okay, so you work on computer parts or not quite yet computer parts. 
1:49 1:53 MALE:  Not quite--it's sort of--the work that I'm--okay, so the--
1:53 1:54 FEMALE:  Parts that might someday be computer parts. 
1:55 1:55 MALE:  No. 
1:56 1:58 FEMALE:  Materials that might someday be computer parts. 
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Hopefully.  
1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Got it.  
2:00 2:00 MALE:  Or devices that would hopefully.  
2:01 2:04 FEMALE:  Cool, PhD?  So, you're here for a while?
2:04 2:05 MALE:  Well, this is my fifth year.
2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  Fifth year.  Man, you're a trooper.  
2:08 2:08 MALE:  Yeah.

2:31 2:31 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] take some time.  
2:34 2:37 MALE:  Well, I mean I'm not done [unintelligible].  [laughter]  I mean I would like to.  
2:38 2:40 FEMALE: Well, September is like five months away now.

2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Does it?
2:43 2:43 MALE:  Yeah.
2:43 2:53 FEMALE:  I would think that there aren't 800 of you coming out a year that, you know, you have something special than the other engineers that came from--
2:54 3:04 MALE:  Well, yeah, but I mean I think that probably [unintelligible] take at least probably three or four months [unintelligible].

4:07 4:07 MALE:  Oh, man.  
4:08 4:16 FEMALE:  Have fun.  Run up those stairs.  There you go. Actually, that might be the women's bathroom.  I don't...
