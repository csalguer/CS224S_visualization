1:46 1:51 MALE: Berkeley. Okay. So what is San Lorenzo like?
1:45 1:56 FEMALE: It's like an urban community and they have a really interesting math program. They do all group learning so it's unique, I'm looking forward to it.
1:58 1:58 MALE: That's cool.
1:58 1:58 FEMALE: So what do you do on your free time?

2:44 2:46 FEMALE: Okay. So that's how you ended up in Massachusetts.	
2:50 2:55 MALE: That's how I was in Massachusetts and then I worked for a few years there, then I went to India and started teaching there as well.
2:53 2:54 FEMALE: Okay. Where did you go to in India?
2:57 3:00 MALE: Bangalore. Do you know where Bangalore is?
2:57 2:57 FEMALE: Nuh--uh.
3:01 3:03 MALE: Bangalore is kind of south central India.
3:02 3:25 FEMALE: Okay. My mother works for Merck, she used to go to India all the time. She went to Bombay. I actually had a chance to go with her one time and I couldn't go because I had finals in school. I really regretted it. I wish I had cancelled my finals and had gone to India. At the time you think that what you're doing is the most important thing in the world. I was like, I can't miss my finals.
3:24 3:29 MALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You would have loved it. Well that is kind of difficult, though.
3:27 3:31 FEMALE: Yeah. But right now I would have been to India. I could have taken the finals anytime.
3:35 3:37 MALE: Go again. Go some time soon.
3:34 3:53 FEMALE: I should, I really should. It was perfect because my mom was working there so she had a driver and it would have been really convenient. My mother and father actually, they went to go see the Taj and did a bunch of tours.  The pictures were just spectacular. I really an envious that I didn't get to go.
3:56 4:00 MALE: You should go, you should definitely go. I spent a lot of time there, about three years there.
3:57 3:57 FEMALE: Did you teach the whole time?
4:02 4:02 MALE: No.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE: Okay. Well it was nice to meet you.
4:07 4:07 MALE: Nice meeting you, too.
