0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  Sorry, it's taking me a little longer.
0:00 0:05 MALE:  This is my stuff.  No, not at all.  I actually mis-lettered some of my things [laughter].
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:19 0:21 MALE:  And now tea, alright.
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  Yes, I am tea.
0:23 0:32 MALE:  I think I'm taken care of.  I kept writing like my, my original number and station and.  Alright, so but anyway, I'm male212, and you are?
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  female240.
0:33 0:37 MALE:  Nice to meet you, so.  Well, what department are you in?  What sort of stuff do you do?
0:38 0:43 FEMALE:  Law school and I'm in my third year.  And I'm graduating in two weeks [laughter].
0:42 0:47 MALE:  Yay, yeah you guys have the semesters in summer, I'm so jealous about that.  I really wish I was back in summer school.
0:45 0:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, no, no.  Actually I wish we were on quarter because we're totally off sync with the rest of the university and it's kind of annoying some, but.
0:49 0:58 MALE:  Really, well yeah, that's true.  Yeah, I'd rather see the whole university conform to you guys than like you conform to the whole university.
0:58 1:07 FEMALE:  Uh, you're ready [laughter] except that I'm graduating, so.  Oh well, even if they do conform to us, I won't be able to experience it [laughter].
1:06 1:11 MALE:  Right, right, so, well what sort of law and stuff do you like focus on and everything?  Just like general stuff?
1:10 1:16 FEMALE:  I don't really have a specialty actually.  I'm going to be in litigation which is um like where you fight like other people.
1:15 1:27 MALE:  Right, right.  Well, I just had a, a lecture in um, and in, everything that you really need to know about the tort system in two hours yesterday.  So I, got, got my fill of all of all that stuff.
1:27 1:29 FEMALE:  Let me guess are you a doctorite?
1:31 1:37 MALE:  I wish I were, but no, actually just a master's student in imaginative science and engineering and that's...
1:35 1:37 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, and you had to know about torts?
1:37 1:49 MALE:  Well there, there's like um, a class in the business school called managers in a legal environment.  So like, for the whole quarter everyday we cover specific sections of law and talk about like the important things for managers and business people to know.
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.
1:50 1:59 MALE:  So, it's pretty interesting  like you know  how easy it is to, you know, do age discrimination and like all sorts of crazy stuff.  But it's nice.
1:56 2:12 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good degree actually.  One of my friends got it and um, now he's like working for a hedge fund and making bank too [laughter].  So it's like, wait, that's not fair, you were only in school for a year and now you make a ton of money [laughter].
2:11 2:20 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I thought about going to law school.  I mean, I think I would have been a little bit happier over there because, you know, you guys do a lot more writing and analytical stuff and...
2:20 2:22 FEMALE:  It's all reading and writing, so.
2:21 2:27 MALE:  Yeah, and they, they stick me with like coding and like, you know thousand [unintelligible].  I don't really want to do that.
2:26 2:28 FEMALE:  I actually miss those, I uh--
2:28 2:29 MALE:  Whoa.
2:29 2:38 FEMALE:  [laughter] because I was an econ undergrad and so like I never really wrote papers before I got to law school.  And all of the sudden I'm writing these papers and I'm just like, you know, I don't know what I'm doing [laughter].
2:38 2:46 MALE:  Yeah, I just like, give me a problem, it's like, well I guess I don't really have any problems in classes this quarter.  But had I, had I had problems, it's like, you know, like why don't  I do it for...
2:45 3:03 FEMALE:  I could help you [laughter].  No, no, no, it's really bad actually because I was a TA for econ one and like I couldn't even remember like a lot of [laughter] the things that I was supposed to be teaching.  So there's no way I could help you with your problems [laughter].  I'd be like, um, yeah I used to know this, maybe, maybe not [laughter].
3:02 3:07 MALE:  You know, it's like you, you just draw like an X and then another X and you just like demand, supply.
3:07 3:08 FEMALE:  Supply, demand [laughter].
3:09 3:12 MALE:  So jot them down so then --
3:12 3:14 FEMALE:  Are you moving along or is it shifting [laughter].
3:15 3:21 MALE:  Well it's all [unintelligible].  So did that like give you a discount on tuition and stuff or?
3:21 3:28 FEMALE:  It did, yeah.  Being a tutor is a really lucrative job actually. And being the econ [unintelligible] TA, um, if you, were you an econ undergrad?
3:28 3:30 MALE:  No, I did the psych instead, no.
3:30 3:42 FEMALE:  Oh, but yeah.  No because um, they hire outside of the econ department obviously because they hired me.  But its one of the best jobs to have, one of the best TA jobs to have because you only have to teach two out of three quarters but you get paid for the whole year.
3:42 3:43 MALE:  Oh, oh, that's good.
3:43 3:53 FEMALE:  So, yeah, but, I mean, I think it's easy for econ grad students because they remember [laughter] they're economics.  But when you're like me and you don't remember it, it's like, oh crap; I have to study [laughter].
3:53 3:55 MALE:  No, we got that all taken care of, so.
3:55 3:56 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:55 3:56 MALE:  Alright, well, thanks a lot.
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, nice meeting you.
3:58 3:59 MALE:  Good luck with, congratulations on graduation.
3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  Thanks.
