0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  [laughter] God that thing is awful. 
0:03 0:03 MALE:  This is a rough station to be stationed in. 
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  I know, I know and I'm here the whole night.  [laughter] 
0:06 0:11 MALE:  Right. I know, I know you're just on guard.  I'm like, totally every single date starts off with like the guy being like terrified out of his wits.  
0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:13 0:15 MALE:  That's nice, I'm going to pre-write on the D, because I always get [unintelligible] at the other end. 
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  Great.  Um, I'm sorry, what was your name again? 
0:18 0:18 MALE:  I'm male218. Hi.  
0:19 0:19 FEMALE:  male218.  
0:20 0:20 MALE:  Yeah, I guess I'm sort of covered. 
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  Covered, I was confused.  
0:22 0:23 MALE:  I should, I should probably move that to the other side.  Thanks for reminding me.  
0:24 0:27 FEMALE:  [laughter] These little things are kind of awkward.  I think, mine keeps slipping down, I should probably adjust it.  
0:28 0:28 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  Anyway--
0:29 0:36 MALE:  I mean, I mean [unintelligible] that I had no idea that I was, that I was like completely covered by that.  Okay.  So what is it that you do around, around here? 
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  Have fun.  Enjoy the sun. 
0:39 0:39 MALE:  Nice.  
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:40 0:40 MALE:  Are you from a place that doesn't usually have sun?  
0:41 0:43 FEMALE:  Well I came from New York so--
0:44 0:44 MALE:  New York.  
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  I'm not originally from New York--
0:46 0:46 MALE:  Okay. 
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  --but I spent the last four years in New York. 
0:47 0:48 MALE:  Okay, like the city, city? 
0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  City, city.  So um--
0:50 0:50 MALE: My best friend--
0:51 0:51 FEMALE:  --in big tall buildings.  
0:52 0:57 MALE:  Interesting, ,y best friend here also spent like four or five years in New York before coming out here.  So he was really enjoying it. 
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:58 1:05 MALE:  He thought at first that he really like sort of being in the middle of, like he felt like in the middle of nature, like hills, like sort of sun and then he moved, promptly moved to San Francisco next year so.
1:06 1:10 FEMALE:  [laughter] Well it, San Francisco's sort of the hybrid, because it's easy to get out. 
1:11 1:11 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:11 1:12 FEMALE:  But you know, you feel--
1:13 1:13 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  --like this sense of comfort with the thing you know--
1:16 1:16 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  --which is big tall buildings--
1:17 1:17 MALE:  Probably yeah. 
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  --and you know, lots of city life and cafes.  
1:19 1:19 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:20 1:22 FEMALE:  Although San Francisco is tiny, it's only like 5:00,000 people. 
1:23 1:24 MALE:  Yeah.  It's like so much smaller then San Jose for like, example.   
1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Right, right.  
1:26 1:27 MALE:  Which is really like the really weird thing for me, because you to go San Jose-- 
1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  But the thing that's weird about the cities out here is just everything's spread out.  
1:31 1:31 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:32 1:33 FEMALE:  Whereas in New York, everything's compressed--
1:34 1:34 MALE:  Right. 
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  --because you only have the islands. 
1:36 1:43 MALE:  Right, and so people had to make a lot of decisions awhile back on how to fit everything in, whereas here, you could just sort of spread as far, as far as they wanted to go. 
1:44 1:44 FEMALE:  So have you been in Palo Alto for awhile?  
1:45 1:50 MALE:  Um, this is my third year in the program.  I'm in Slavic languages and literature.  
1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  Oh really? 
1:52 1:52 MALE:  And so--yeah--third year out of--
1:52 1:53 FEMALE:  You are the first non-engineer I have met.  
1:54 1:54 MALE:  Really?  
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:55 1:55 MALE:  In like this little train here? 
1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
1:58 1:59 MALE:  I'm from Colorado, I heard there are a couple of other Coloradoans like floating around here.  
2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  There are a couple of other Coloradoans. 
2:01 2:02 MALE:  Other Coloradoans, okay. 
2:03 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, but you're different.  Which Slavic language do you do successfully? 
2:07 2:12 MALE:  I do Russian, I also do some Serbo-Croatian, although, like our department says Slavic it's really like a glorified Russian department--
2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  Okay. 
2:14 2:14 MALE:  --that sort of the occasional opportunity to do other things.  
2:15 2:18 FEMALE:  I actually spent last summer um, in, on the Dalmatian coast--
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Oh really? 
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  --which was really nice. 
2:21 2:23 MALE:  Really, I was there, I was there the summer before.  What were you there for? 
2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  Just vacation.  [laughter] 
2:25 2:25 MALE:  Oh okay. Okay. 
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  It's uh, it's a nice place to vacation.  
2:27 2:29 MALE:  Yeah.  It is a great, it is a great place.  Were you in like Dubrovnik or around there? 
2:30 2:35 FEMALE:  Uh, yeah, well we, I was only there for about, how long, like a week and a half. 
2:36 2:36 MALE:  Uh huh.  
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  So not too long.  
2:37 2:37 MALE:  Right. 
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  We spent the summer touring Eastern Europe, but--
2:39 2:39 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  --but--
2:41 2:41 MALE:  Great choice. 
2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:42 2:43 MALE:  A lot cheaper then, then Western Europe. 
2:44 2:45 FEMALE:  And it--its' like been there done that, right?  [laughter] 
2:46 2:47 MALE:  A lot less Germans too.  Just what I noticed. 
2:48 2:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.  There's--well were on a, a boat--
2:51 2:51 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:51 2:59 FEMALE:  --um, where we took uh, we took a cruise just sort of through the islands, and it was just um, it was four couples total.  
3:00 3:00 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  So it was my friend and I--
3:01 3:01 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:01 3:08 FEMALE:  --um, and then two French girls, a French couple and then an Italian couple.  So it was very diverse.  
3:09 3:11 MALE:  Wow.  Were you guys there for like a long time?  Like a few weeks all in there?  
3:12 3:12 FEMALE:  Just a week, just a week on the boat.  
3:13 3:13 MALE:  Okay. 
3:14 3:18 FEMALE:  Um, but that was, it was great.  And both my friend and I spoke a little bit of French--
3:19 3:19 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:19 3:21 FEMALE:  --and so, and then the two French girls were the same age as us--
3:22 3:22 MALE:  Right. 
3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  --so it was a lot of fun.  
3:24 3:24 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:24 3:31 FEMALE:  And that point, we'd been traveling around so much, my friend and I, that we were like we're sick of this, we can't think of anything of anything else to say to each other so, it was great to have--
3:32 3:32 MALE:  Supply some fresh blood in there.  
3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  --some, exactly, fresh blood. 
3:35 3:39 MALE:  That is the thing on traveling, it's like after, after the second day, you feel like you have a lot more to say, it gets a little bit hard.  
3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  Right. 
3:41 3:44 MALE:  Its' sort of fun thing about traveling because then you're always sort of looking for new things to actually be able to talk about. 
3:45 3:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So you're getting a PhD? 
3:46 3:47 MALE:  PhD, yeah.  It usually takes like seven years. 
3:48 3:48 FEMALE:  Oh my gosh.  
3:49 3:49 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:50 3:50 FEMALE:  That's dedication. 
3:51 3:56 MALE:  Well we spend a lot of our time, like abroad, like they really encourage us to go to Croatia or Serbia and then, for me at least, and then to Russia.
3:57 3:57 FEMALE:  Oh really?
