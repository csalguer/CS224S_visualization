00:01  00:02	MALE:  [horn] How are you?  Good.
00:02  00:03	FEMALE:  Hi male212.
00:03  00:03	MALE:  female238, nice to meet you.
00:04  00:05	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  I like your tie.
00:06  00:09	MALE:  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, it's my lucky tie from graduate school.
00:11  00:11	FEMALE:  Oh. 
00:13  00:14	MALE:  I sort of collect artsy ties.
00:15  00:17	FEMALE:  Interesting.  Are you an art person or just an art tie person?
00:18  00:32	MALE:  Sort of.  Well, I enjoy going to museums or whatever, but I took one art history class in undergrad.  But, it's always nice to go to like a museum and say like oh, you know this painting has excellent use of line or something.  It's pretty cool.
00:33  00:37	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I was just -- I went to D.C. for a couple of weeks.
00:38  00:38	MALE:  Oh really?
00:39  00:47	FEMALE:  Yeah, I lived there formally, but I hadn't been -- someone came and visited me while I was there.  So I got to be like tour guide and had an excuse to the Smithsonian and stuff again.  National Gallery, it was just so great.
00:48  00:59	MALE:  Yeah, I went there I think actually two years ago for my birthday it was pretty nice.  Yeah have you been to like the Udvar Hazy Museum like they have at Dulles like at the new air and space one.
01:00  01:01	FEMALE:  No, uh-huh.
01:02  01:03	MALE:  Yeah, I guess they built one over there.
01:04  01:10	FEMALE:  Yeah.  No, I haven't -- I haven't um, lived in the area for probably like six years now.  So I just kind of did the mall when I was just visiting.
01:11  01:25	MALE:  Yeah, it was funny I flew into like Washington like Reagan National and that was cool.  I went to my little thing and got back.  But then when I booked my flight, Reagan National, Dulles they are all about the same to me so I flew out of like Dulles.
01:26  01:26	FEMALE:  Oh.
01:26  01:27	MALE:  That was a longer drive.
01:28  01:30	FEMALE:  Yeah, that can be a pain, yeah.
01:31  01:32	MALE:  Yeah that was a longer drive.
01:32  01:33	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:33  01:37	MALE:   So what do you do now that you're not in the excitement of Washington D.C.?
01:38  01:44	FEMALE:  Oh, you know I just cry myself to sleep at night, you know.  You know, doing grad school.  I'm writing my dissertation. 
01:45  01:45	MALE:  Really?
01:46  01:47	FEMALE:  I'm half way done and I should finish this summer.
01:48  01:55	MALE:  What's the subject?
01:56  01:57	FEMALE:  Um, linguistics is my department and I'm evaluating a curriculum I wrote and tested in some classrooms.  
01:58  01:58	MALE:  Okay, cool.
01:59  02:00	FEMALE:  Um, yeah.  How about you?
02:01  02:04	MALE:  Actually, I've take some like classes in like second language acquisition and it was like linguistics and stuff.  It's all pretty interesting.
02:05  02:07	FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's fun stuff.
02:08  02:15	MALE:  Although, like my intro in linguistics class I missed the phonetics lecture and so to this day, I still can barely do the International Phonetic Alphabet. 
02:16  02:24	FEMALE:  Oh, that's a serious skill to be lacking, it's really fun. Especially if you have like kids around and you need to write things that they can't quite understand, it comes in handy.  It's like a code language.
02:25  02:27	MALE:  Yeah, the upside down R and --
02:28  02:29	FEMALE:  Exactly.  
02:30  02:31	MALE:  That's pretty cool.
02:32  02:33	FEMALE:  So what department are you in?
02:33  02:34	MALE:  I'm in management, science and engineering, so --
02:35  02:35	FEMALE:  What's that?
02:36  02:43	MALE:  It's like -- ideally it's a combination between like the business school and engineering, sort of managing technical ventures.
02:44  02:44	FEMALE:  Ah-huh.
02:45  02:58	MALE:  It's fairly -- its okay.  I mean, I really like the psychology and sort of organizational behavior working with people and stuff.  So I'm not in engineering.  But I take more engineering classes that I like too.
02:59  02:59	FEMALE:  Okay.  Did you do engineering as an undergrad or?
03:01  03:04	MALE:  No, I did like French and psychology.
03:05  03:06	FEMALE:  Wow, so you're a fuzzy becoming a techy manager.
03:07  03:10	MALE:  I know.  I like to say that were technically fuzzy or something.
03:11  03:15	FEMALE:  [laughter] or fuzzily technical.  It doesn't really work, fuzzy --
03:16  03:16	MALE:  Yeah.
03:16  03:17	FEMALE:  Yeah.
03:18  03:19	MALE:  Form that group on face book or something.  That's cool.
03:20  03:21	FEMALE:  Yeah.  That's funny.
03:22  03:27	MALE:  So what sorts of things do you do in your time when you're not doing dissertations?
03:28  03:31	FEMALE:  Well, that's a slim moment of time that I'm not.
03:32  03:33	MALE:  Takes longer than you think.
03:34  03:49	FEMALE:  Well, I really want to finish so, I'm working really hard.  But, um, you know, I cook a lot and I feed people a lot because I cook a lot and I do a lot of Yoga and skate around -- hang out with my cat, work in my garden.
03:50  03:51	MALE:  I didn't, you're allowed to keep cats in the dorm or?
03:51  03:53	FEMALE:  No, I live off campus, now.
03:54  03:54	MALE:  Oh, I see.
03:55  03:56	FEMALE:  So what about [horn] you?  Oh, well it was nice to meet you male212.
