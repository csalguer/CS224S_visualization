1:02 1:13 FEMALE:  Okay.  Yeah, so, but like -- and then I got very tired, so I slept, slept, slept, so now after I've slept I feel better.  

0:56 0:57 MALE:  You feel sore.  

1:15 1:31 FEMALE:  Yeah exactly.  Like this leg and I have to walk very slow and so I feel lots of work during the, during the camping.  Like especially the hiking.

1:50 1:51 FEMALE:  Oh really.  

1:33 1:33 MALE:  For 20 minutes.   

1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

1:35 1:45 MALE:  But it's just for health reasons because my cholesterol is high.  It's like -- my cholesterol is like maybe 20% higher than most people, so I exercise to keep it down because it's my DNA.  

2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  Really?  

1:46 1:47 MALE:  [unintelligible].  

2:05 2:09 FEMALE:  I don't know, there is such a DNA like it would bring --  

1:51 2:00 MALE:  Well it's just genetics.  That's like my dad has the problem and his mother had the problem, so I have the problem, but it's easy to fix, I just have to exercise.  

2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  Oh.  

2:01 2:05 MALE:  I used to hate it, but now I like it because I watch TV while I'm doing it, it makes it much easier.

2:28 2:28 FEMALE:  Wow.  

2:11 2:40 MALE:  And so it shines on the screen and so I can exercise.  And it's like nine feet and I can exercise to comedy usually because it's funny or movies I rent a movie and then everyday I'll watch 20 minutes and stop it and -- I watch scary movies, so this girl, Nicole Kidman, she's about to open the door and it's like the lights are on in the room, but they weren't supposed to be on because nobody was supposed to be in there and so and I stopped it right there, I just landed right on 20 minutes.  So what kind of things do you do for fun?  

3:00 3:13 FEMALE:  Well, I um, I probably just watch movies and watch movies, listen to music and things like that.  Like what do you do, nothing very special.

3:52 3:56 FEMALE:  Yeah, I would think it, but I think it's very expensive, so I haven't really --
