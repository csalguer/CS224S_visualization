@N/A	  MALE: Yeah, even the breaks are questions.
@0:03 0:05 FEMALE: [laughter]  female332.
@N/A	  MALE: [unintelligible]
0:08 0:09 FEMALE: We haven't actually started yet.
0:00 0:02 MALE: How's it been so far for you, female332?
0:12 0:12 FEMALE: Oh, it's fun.  
0:03 0:03 MALE: Yeah?
0:13 0:20 FEMALE: It's a- it's a little fast-paced.  I'm not used to uh you know, trying to meet people and, you know, with a buzzer going off.  
0:10 0:17 MALE: Exactly.  [laughter]  I know, with a timer, right, you have to time your conversations where you can tell a little bit about yourself, but your story has to have a point pretty quick, otherwise-- 
0:28 0:30 FEMALE: Yeah, definitely.  No, the- the long and rambling is not an option.
0:21 0:21 MALE: It's not.
0:32 0:32 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:22 0:24 MALE: So tell me about one something you did today, female332.
0:34 0:48 FEMALE: One something I did today.  That's a great question.  Um.  See, this is hard, 'cause I'm uh I'm defending my proposal in a week.
0:38 0:38 MALE: [laughter]
0:50 0:56 FEMALE: So [laughter] I've been writing my proposal all day.  Um.  But I slept in and that was awesome.
0:56 0:58 MALE: There you go, yeah, that's gotta be great, right.
0:58 1:01 FEMALE: And right now, like that's the most fun thing I could think of doing, so--
0:51 0:58 MALE: Right.  Works for me, you know, like sometimes those days are the best, and you're like you see your alarm and go oh wait, you just go back to bed.  You know, there's no reason for me to get up.
1:08 1:11 FEMALE: Like you know, I don't actually need to get out of this bed all the time.
1:02 1:07 MALE: So what's so interesting about your topic that you want to have a uh, you want to do a proposal and have like a doctoral thesis or whatever.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE: What's so interesting about it?
1:08 1:09 MALE: Like why is it interesting to listen to?  
1:19 1:31 FEMALE: Um.  So, so I study um the effects of, yeah I had some blank pages, too [horn] it's kind of weird.  [laughter]  I don't know.  Just threw 'em in for the--
1:22 1:22 MALE: I don't know.
1:32 1:37 FEMALE: Um.  I study the effects of global environmental change on plants.
1:27 1:27 MALE: Oooo.
1:38 1:48 FEMALE: Um, And so, really excited about that 'cause I'm really excited about science, but I also want to do something that, you know, is relevant to the condition of people in the world, and so--
1:38 1:38 MALE: Totally.
1:48 1:52 FEMALE: --you know, what's going to happen to plants, what's going to happen to the world, future.
1:43 1:45 MALE: I mean, that's a big science right now, with a lot of questions, and not a lot of answers, and--
1:55 1:56 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah exactly.
1:46 1:54 MALE: It's hard to predict that stuff.  It's hard to even, like where you can predict, you can predict anything, but it's hard to really gather the evidence and really make a solid case for your own prediction.
2:04 2:05 FEMALE: Yeah, totally.
1:55 1:59 MALE: That's really cool. I'm going to be teaching at a school next year that's uh based on envrionmental leadership.
2:09 2:09 FEMALE: Oh, cool.  
2:00 2:03 MALE: It's a kind of, kind of uh, yeah kind of up that alley.
2:13 2:14 FEMALE: You're at what school?
2:04 2:16 MALE: It's called Excel Academy, in San Francisco.  It's a, it's a charter school, so it's a public school but it, we'll be in our third year next year, and it kind of started from like a program to bring in environmental leadership to urban kids and to kind of respond into a school.  So--
2:27 2:30 FEMALE: Cool.  That's awesome.  Um, so you're in the school of education.  Or, yeah.
2:21 2:23 MALE: Yeah, I am, I'm in the teacher education program.
2:33 2:34 FEMALE: Oh, awesome.  
2:25 2:28 MALE: It's great, it's a good place.  It's fun, it's really intense, though, you know, teach in the mornings and then have class in the afternoon, and then you--
2:40 2:52 FEMALE: My god, I mean, you know, I've taught, a little bit, just from being in this program, and it, like it takes it out of you.  I don't know how- I don't know how like an elementary school teacher can teach all day long.  It's incredible.
2:41 2:44 MALE: With the same kids all day long.  It's definitely the hardest thing I've ever done.
2:54 2:59 FEMALE: I mean, you know, I teach like a couple of review session, and I'm done for the day.  [laughter]
2:50 2:50 MALE: [laughter]
3:00 3:03 FEMALE: You know, I don't, I don't have it in me to do anything more.
2:53 2:55 MALE: And you have motivated kids, you have highly motivated students, right?
3:05 3:06 FEMALE: Yeah, exactly.  [crosstalk]  
2:55 3:06 MALE: You get in there, and the kids are like, the kids don't want to, either they want to be anywhere but there, or they want to do-- like they'll be, "Oh, there come the class," and then they just want to talk to their friends, or you know, like talk on their cell phone, in class, you know, like, and you're like-- 
3:17 3:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah, so this is a high school that you're teaching at?
3:10 3:10 MALE: Yeah.
3:21 3:24 FEMALE: Yes.  Are you, what- what uh subject do you teach?  
3:15 3:15 MALE: I teach math.  
3:26 3:26 FEMALE: Cool.
3:17 3:17 MALE: I'm a math teacher.
3:27 3:28 FEMALE: Cool, I was a math major.  
3:18 3:24 MALE: Ah, there you go.  I was a math major, as well, but I didn't, I never really considered like going to another like mathematically related field.  
3:35 3:35 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:25 3:37 MALE: I thought, but I thought I might I teach and it came out to be true.  And the best thing, when I was at school, as a math major, like I have a lot of free classes, to do other things, it was great, so I only took like one math class a semester, but I took lots of education classes and history classes and science classes.  
3:48 3:49 FEMALE: Totally.  Where did you go?  
3:39 3:39 MALE: I went to Brown, in Rhode Island.
3:50 3:50 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
3:41 3:44 MALE: Out east.  I'm from Portland, Oregon, originally.
3:54 3:55 FEMALE: Oh, no way, I'm from Corvalis.
3:45 3:48 MALE: Ah, there you go.  I love Oregon, cool.
3:58 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:48 3:50 MALE: Have you, do you think you're going to go back there some day?
4:00 4:02 FEMALE: I would love to.  I love Oregon.  
3:53 4:02 MALE: That's great. I miss it a lot, yeah.  I love, I don't know, it's just laid back, like no one complain-- here it- it never rains, but people complain when it rains, as soon as- as soon as they do, right. 
4:12 4:13 FEMALE: I miss the rain so much.  [laughter]
4:04 4:05 MALE: [laughter] People become crazy.  
4:16 4:26 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, like this winter, everyone keeps talking about, "Oh my god, it's the middle of May- May and it's still raining, it started rain- raining in October," and I'm like, "How could you ask for a better winter?"  Like this is the great-- 
4:16 4:18 MALE: I know!  Everything was really green, all the sudden it got really-- 
4:28 4:28 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:19 4:21 MALE: I came here in the summertime in June, and everything was like dead and brown, right.
4:31 4:32 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
4:23 4:28 MALE: And uh, but then by like November, the season like reversed, and everything got green in like November, it was amazing.  
4:38 4:52 FEMALE: Yeah, well, I mean, that happens noramlly in the winters here, 'cause you know, the rains fall in the winter and that's the when the grass grows, but like this year, the grass is still green, but the trees have leafed out, like it's awesome.  I've-- everyone keeps awaiting for it to get sunny, what the hell.  [laughter]
4:42 4:45 MALE: What, you want to be hot?  You want to be like complaining about being sweaty all the time.
4:56 4:56 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  
4:49 4:52 MALE: Yeah, so it's good.  I mean, California's good, but it's no Oregon.  
5:02 5:03 FEMALE: Exactly, exactly.  Yeah.  
4:55 4:57 MALE: Cool.  Um.  Did you do undergrad here?
5:07 5:09 FEMALE: No, it was the University of Chicago.
4:59 5:01 MALE: Wow.  Heard that's just a pretty intense place.  
5:12 5:17 FEMALE: It is.  Although, like you were saying about the, the math major at Brown, being a math major gave me a lot of flexibility.
5:07 5:08 MALE: Really? 
5:18 5:18 FEMALE: Yeah.  
5:18 5:18 MALE: That's great.
5:19 5:29 FEMALE: I mean, it was still, it was still intense, but like I got to take a lot of classes and stuff that wasn't necessarily, you know, directly related, which was great.  Yeah.  I really miss that about that in grad school.
5:20 5:21 MALE: Yeah, all my cla-- I don't really have a lot of choices.
5:31 5:32 FEMALE: It's so scripted.  
5:22 5:42 MALE: Although it's been good this year, because they just kind of, they set you off, and then they kind of, I know exactly what I have to do when I have to do it, and they kind of let me know everything I have to do, 'cause I have so much going on, it's like, it's good that I kind of have that down.  Good to meet you, female332.
