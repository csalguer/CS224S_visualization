1:16 1:17 FEMALE: Yes.  Riding horses.
1:18 1:22 MALE: So riding horses.  And do you have a--I mean, do you have--do you own your own horses or?
1:22 1:24 FEMALE: Um, I don't.  I ride my trainer's horses.
1:25 1:25 MALE: Okay.  I see.
1:25 1:26 FEMALE: So she trains me on her horses.
1:27 1:28 MALE: That's interesting.
1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:29 1:31 MALE: Okay.  I don't think I know a lot of people who has--
1:31 1:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  I don't know a lot of people either, except for the people I meet at the barn, so.
1:35 1:35 MALE: It's kind of funny.
1:36 1:37 FEMALE: Yeah.  What about you?
1:38 1:40 MALE: I have a more mundane interest like [laughter].
1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Sorry.
1:42 1:43 MALE: No, that's fine.  That's really nice.
1:44 1:44 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:44 1:50 MALE: Like watching, uh, watching movies, a lot of reading, especially in history and politics.
1:51 1:51 FEMALE: Oh yeah.
1:51 1:53 MALE: And I don't know why, I mean, especially global issues. 
1:53 1:54 FEMALE: Well it's kind of nice to read.
1:54 1:54 MALE: Right.
1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Right.  Yeah.
1:56 2:08 MALE: So global issues, things like international politics, um, global history, why things are the way they are.  So that's what I spend a lot of time reading of.  I also enjoy music, both classical and rock music.
2:09 2:12 FEMALE: Listening or playing?  Listening to?
2:12 2:23 MALE: Listening to, yeah.  Um, this blind thing is one of my frustrations from childhood--like I would have, in another life, if I had to live my life again, that's what I have--I would have tried to play an instrument or something.
2:24 2:25 FEMALE: It's hard.  It's really, really hard.
2:25 2:28 MALE: It's hard.  I know.  But I have--I think I have--I like music very much.
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: Right, right.
2:30 2:30 MALE: So I definitely like music.
2:30 2:30 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:31 2:43 MALE: It's one of my preferred hobbies.  Like, not only classical or rock, I also like musicals, uh, music movies.  So I really, I really enjoy music. It's very nice.
2:43 2:46 FEMALE: You could start now [laughter].  You could try.
2:48 2:50 MALE: I'm going to stay here for a few years, so you never know.
2:50 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah. What would you play?
2:51 2:53 MALE: Uh, piano.
2:53 2:54 FEMALE: Piano.  Yeah.
2:55 2:55 MALE: I mean, uh--
2:56 3:00 FEMALE: My mom made me take piano lessons.  I was horrible, horrible [laughter] at it.
3:00 3:02 MALE: How many years did you, uh, do?  Like--
3:02 3:10 FEMALE: Probably like four years or something.  That's when I was younger, and as long--as soon as I got old enough to realize I don't want to do this anymore, I kind of stopped, 'cause--
3:11 3:11 MALE: [laughter] That's really funny.
3:11 3:12 FEMALE: I was really bad at it [laughter].
3:14 3:17 MALE: In my case, it's not a question of being good or bad.
3:17 3:17 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:18 3:20 MALE: It's really--I really love music, so.
3:19 3:21 FEMALE: Right.  I mean, I guess I didn't enjoy it either.
3:21 3:29 MALE: So one of the things I do, like the most, is when I get home, I put my preferred music, volume [unintelligible].  I relax.
3:29 3:29 FEMALE: Nice.
3:32 3:33 MALE: [laughter] If I bother the neighbors, that's fine [laughter].
3:33 3:34 FEMALE: Yeah.  I was going to say, I hope your neighbors don't mind [laughter].
3:36 3:44 MALE: So I really like that.  And um, watching movies, and that's pretty much it.  I, uh, I don't have--at some point, I'd really loved traveling a lot.
3:45 3:45 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.
3:46 3:48 MALE: But then I got one of those traveling jobs, when I was in the industry.
3:49 3:49 FEMALE: Oh yeah.
3:50 3:50 MALE: And then, I began to hate it.
3:50 3:50 FEMALE: Not so cool.
3:51 3:55 MALE: Not so cool.  So right now, I like to live in the--I don't want to move much.
3:56 3:56 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:56 3:57 MALE: And that's basically it.
3:58 3:58 FEMALE: Where were you before you came here?
3:59 4:03 MALE: Here?  I was [unintelligible].  Nice to meet you.
4:03 4:04 FEMALE: Yes, you too [laughter].
