0:07 0:12 MALE: I have been marking acquaintance for never met until I actually ran into an acquaintance.

0:09 0:10 FEMALE: And then you were like-

0:13 0:15 MALE: And then I was like, oops.

0:15 0:17 FEMALE: I'm sure it will be okay.

0:22 0:24 MALE: They'll figure out I can't know everyone here.

0:20 0:25 FEMALE: That's right.  Well I've been like filling them out so fast I feel badly.

0:28 0:28 MALE: Uh huh.

0:27 0:35 FEMALE: Okay, this will be fast.  Okay.  Hi.

0:40 0:40 MALE: female121.

0:36 0:37 FEMALE: female121, sorry.

0:41 0:42 MALE: I think I have seen you before.

0:42 0:43 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:44 0:46 MALE: I have a friend named Ivec [phonetic] who is in the ed school.

0:44 0:47 FEMALE: At the Nuthouse.  Were you at the Nuthouse for his birthday one time?

0:50 0:51 MALE: Yes.  Uh huh.

0:48 0:48 FEMALE: Excellent.

0:52 0:55 MALE: And I stopped by the--the beer party the other day.

0:51 0:55 FEMALE: Oh goodness.  And you saw me in [laughter] 

0:59 1:03 MALE: [laughter] You're not always like that?

1:00 1:00 FEMALE: No.

1:05 1:08 MALE: [unintelligible] I don't remember you doing anything too embarrassing.

1:03 1:03 FEMALE: It was--

1:09 1:10 MALE: If that makes you feel better.

1:06 1:09 FEMALE: Thank you.  A lot of flip cup.

1:11 1:11 MALE: Uh huh.

1:10 1:13 FEMALE: [laughter] A lot of flip cup.  It was really fun.  We had--

1:16 1:17 MALE: And beer pong.

1:14 1:23 FEMALE: Yeah, I didn't--um, I played one game of Beirut and I was terrible.  But that was way at the end of the evening so things were sort of [laughter] on their way down.

1:26 1:26 MALE: You're already-

1:24 1:24 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:27 1:28 MALE: It's pretty hard by then.

1:25 1:27 FEMALE: Yeah, it was fun.  I'm glad you come.

1:31 1:31 MALE: [unintelligible] 

1:27 1:29 FEMALE: Are you in the ed school or no?

1:32 1:33 MALE: No, I'm not. 

1:29 1:30 FEMALE: Which school are you in?

1:33 1:34 MALE: I'm in computer science.

1:32 1:32 FEMALE: Okay.

1:35 1:37 MALE: I know him from playing Frisbee.

1:34 1:34 FEMALE: Oh okay.

1:38 1:39 MALE: --the computer science people.

1:36 1:38 FEMALE: Oh good.  So Zack really gets out and he knows a lot of--

1:41 1:43 MALE: Yeah he really does.

1:40 1:46 FEMALE: And maybe because he was here-I mean, I know as an undergrad it was a little while ago but I mean, I think there is still some overlap so he--

1:50 1:53 MALE: Yeah.  So, well he knows quite a few people here.

1:50 1:52 FEMALE: He's really good about that stuff.

1:56 1:56 MALE: Yeah.

1:53 1:57 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's nice.  It's good because theirs actually is one of the more social programs.

2:01 2:03 MALE: Okay, you're not in the same program?

1:59 2:02 FEMALE: No, I'm in a policy and leadership program.

2:06 2:06 MALE: Uh huh.

2:03 2:05 FEMALE: So it's also a one year masters but--

2:08 2:08 MALE: Okay.

2:05 2:18 FEMALE: --it's sort of a different side of the education scene so um, but it's interesting because they--and they're lucky because they have the summer.  They're here for one whole year instead of nine months, so they were here for the summer before we arrived, so they got to really get together--

2:22 2:22 MALE: Yeah.

2:19 2:20 FEMALE: --they have a pretty tight group.

2:24 2:24 MALE: Yeah, uh huh.

2:20 2:26 FEMALE: It's fun.  So I'm just starting to get into that [unintelligible] get into hanging out with them, which has been really fun.

2:30 2:31 MALE: That's more fun than your group?

2:27 2:34 FEMALE: No, my group's really fun but they're like this--for me they're like a second fun group to hang out with.  It's nice to get out of my group every now--

2:35 2:39 MALE: Okay, kind of like the cool ed school people.

2:35 2:36 FEMALE: They're pretty cool.

2:41 2:41 MALE: Uh huh.

2:37 2:43 FEMALE: They're pretty cool.  Yeah, it's a pretty social program.  The whole thing is pretty social.

2:47 2:47 MALE: Yeah.

2:44 2:49 FEMALE: How's yours?  How's  [laughter] You play Frisbee.

2:52 2:53 MALE: Yeah. That's true.

2:50 2:50 FEMALE: That's a good sign.  

2:54 2:58 MALE: Yeah, that's probably on the more social aspect.  It's big and I think probably--

2:54 2:56 FEMALE: How big?  What does that mean?  How big is big?

3:00 3:05 MALE: Um, about like 30 Phd students here and probably 100 to 150 new masters students.

3:02 3:03 FEMALE: Holy mackerel.  

3:07 3:15 MALE: Yeah, so--and it's so big and like the masters and the PhD students kind of invited somewhat.

3:11 3:11 FEMALE: Really?

3:16 3:16 MALE: Yeah.

3:13 3:16 FEMALE: You don't even take classes like in the beginning of your Ph--  

3:19 3:20 MALE: Well yeah.  You--

3:17 3:18 FEMALE: I mean, I would think there'd be some overlap.

3:21 3:23 MALE: Yeah, uh huh.  Very.

3:19 3:21 FEMALE: Uh huh.  Uh huh.  But still.

3:25 3:29 MALE: Yeah so well there's maybe not as much other, but maybe it bigger than the ed school.

3:27 3:27 FEMALE: Uh huh.

3:30 3:32 MALE: But--and also obviously--

3:28 3:29 FEMALE: It sounds bigger.

3:32 3:37 MALE: --people in the CS school are not quite as social in general as other--

3:34 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah, you're here doing this.  That's a good sign.

3:39 3:40 MALE: Yeah.  Uh huh.

3:37 3:38 FEMALE: [laughter] 

3:41 3:41 MALE: That's true.

3:38 3:39 FEMALE: You're getting out and about.

3:42 3:42 MALE: Yeah.

3:39 3:40 FEMALE: That's great.

3:44 3:46 MALE: And yeah.  I'm being social here.

3:42 3:46 FEMALE: You are.  You are.  Yeah it's um--have you ever done anything like this before?

3:50 3:51 MALE: No, have you?

3:47 3:54 FEMALE: No.  It's interesting because I have Professor nameX for a class this quarter so he like handed the form out in class and was like, okay who's coming?

3:59 3:59 MALE: Yeah.

3:55 3:58 FEMALE: It was like, all right [laughter] 

4:02 4:02 MALE: Uh huh.

3:59 4:03 FEMALE: And it seemed like a reasonably safe-safe to do it in.

4:07 4:07 MALE: Uh huh.

4:04 4:14 FEMALE: You know, I mean, in terms of like instead of doing it [horn] in San Fran--  Like I think they have them in the city, which would be kind of--  At least you sort of have a sense of where folks are coming from.

4:17 4:18 MALE: That's true, yeah you don't know.

4:15 4:17 FEMALE: Here?  You were born in the city.

4:21 4:22 MALE: Somewhere here.

4:19 4:20 FEMALE: Yeah, nice to see you.
