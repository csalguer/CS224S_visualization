0:00:05.4  0:00:06.0  MALE:  So female322.  My name is male317.
0:00:06.5  0:00:07.5  FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male317.
0:00:07.0  0:00:09.2  MALE:  [unintelligible] so hat do you do?  What are you doing? 
0:00:09.7  0:00:14.9  FEMALE:  Um, I am in the school of education here I am learning to be a math teacher.
0:00:14.4  0:00:15.2  MALE:  Oh, okay. 
0:00:15.7  0:00:17.2  FEMALE:  That is what I am working on how about you?
0:00:16.7  0:00:24.6  MALE:  Um, I am in the school of electrical engineering.  I'm getting my doctorate.  And um, I have been here for a very long time [laughter]. 
0:00:25.1  0:00:25.8  FEMALE:  How long have you been here? 
0:00:25.3  0:00:26.7  MALE:  N years. 
0:00:27.2  0:00:28.7  FEMALE:  Ten years really?
0:00:28.2  0:00:28.8  MALE:  N years.
0:00:29.3  0:00:30.7  FEMALE:  Oh, N.  Oh, I got you.
0:00:30.2  0:00:42.7  MALE:  N is greater than should be told [laughter]. Yeah, I've been here for a very long time.  Yeah, a little while.  I do a bunch of other things too.
0:00:43.2  0:00:47.8  FEMALE: In electrical engineering what do you do?  What are you working on?
0:00:47.3  0:00:51.2  MALE:  On computers. I design computers to be--
0:00:51.7  0:00:52.9  FEMALE:  [interposing] oh, designing computers. 
0:00:52.4  0:00:53.9  MALE:  Yeah, to be faster and better.
0:00:54.4  0:00:55.2  FEMALE:  Ah hah! 
0:00:54.7  0:00:56.7  MALE:  You know, the next generation computers? 
0:00:57.2  0:01:00.5  FEMALE:  You're on the cusp of the, of the next generation then? 
0:01:00.0  0:01:00.4  MALE:  You have to be [unintelligible]. 
0:01:00.9  0:01:06.6  FEMALE:  Yeah.   Because it is such a fast paced deal.
0:01:06.1  0:01:06.8  MALE:  Absolutely.
0:01:07.3  0:01:20.9  FEMALE:  Right? This is going to seem so juvenile to you but like when I was in college I took a C++ program and I understand that is fully way out of date now, right?
0:01:20.9  0:01:27.6  MALE:  Not really, no, no, no.  Actually C++ is still pretty good.  I'm actually impressed with the [unintelligible] because you're not a programmer right?
0:01:28.1  0:01:31.8  FEMALE:  No.  I mean I programmed in C++ and it was really a pain in the ass.
0:01:31.4  0:01:35.0  MALE:  Okay [unintelligible].  You just take math type courses?	
0:01:35.5  0:01:35.5  FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:35.0  0:01:36.4  MALE:  [unintelligible] background courses. 
0:01:36.9  0:01:44.2  FEMALE:  Yeah.  We had to--at my school we had to take a couple of computer science classes, typical to math requirement.
0:01:43.7  0:01:44.8  MALE:  Huh.  Okay. [unintelligible]. 
0:01:45.3  0:01:51.9  FEMALE:  [unintelligible]. That's hard work I mean it is really frustrating even more so that math I thought--
0:01:51.4  0:01:54.1  MALE:  Yeah, I like math [unintelligible].
0:01:54.6  0:02:04.9  FEMALE:  [crosstalk] because something like a semi colon can throw you off in programming whereas in math if you got the concepts, like you got the concepts but programming you got the concepts but you have to have all the impact as well.
0:02:04.4  0:02:07.7  MALE:  [unintelligible] not just pure math, but math education.
0:02:08.2  0:02:08.7  FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:02:08.2  0:02:10.8  MALE:  Are you planning on teaching at the high school level?
0:02:11.3  0:02:20.9  FEMALE:  I want to teach at the high school level.  I'm really interested in, in um, I'm interested in political aspects of math education. 
0:02:20.4  0:02:21.1  MALE:  Okay. 
0:02:21.6  0:02:32.1  FEMALE: Critical and social aspects of it.  So in changing who has access to learning math because it determines who has becomes successful later on.
0:02:31.6  0:02:32.9  MALE:  That's right.  That's right. 
0:02:33.4  0:02:39.3  FEMALE:  And I think it is going to be a great equalizer in helping in making it successful for more students.
0:02:38.8  0:02:42.3  MALE:  That's really interesting, I think.  So where are you planning on teaching after you get out of here? 
0:02:42.8  0:02:46.2  FEMALE:  I am planning on teaching at Berkeley High School. 
0:02:45.7  0:02:46.0  MALE: Okay.
0:02:46.5  0:02:48.1  FEMALE:  So I will be there next year.
0:02:47.6  0:02:49.4  MALE:  Cool.  What is Berkeley High School like?  Is it very...? 
0:02:49.9  0:03:08.2  FEMALE:  Well it's in Berkeley so it sort of like runs the whole gamut of student population so it is super diverse and it has politically active student body and a really wonderful principal who is interested in social change.  It is pretty exciting.
0:03:07.7  0:03:10.5  MALE:  I got a lot of students interested in teaching.  I've actually--
0:03:11.0  0:03:11.1  FEMALE:  [interposing] oh, really. 
0:03:10.6  0:03:18.1  MALE: Yeah,  I tutor a lot of students [unintelligible] been here for awhile. 
0:03:18.6  0:03:23.9  FEMALE:  Where in India actually I am horrible with geography so you are going to have to help me out. 
0:03:23.4  0:03:28.3  MALE:  Bangelore [unintelligible] India is like uni--it's right about the center of India.  
0:03:28.8  0:03:29.2  FEMALE: Okay.
0:03:28.7  0:03:33.3  MALE:  South Center.  Bangelore is actually the computer capital of India.	
0:03:33.8  0:03:36.0  FEMALE:  Oh ok, right, right, right.
0:03:35.5  0:03:43.8  MALE:  [unintelligible].  But these kids are from a poor school they don't have any access to computers at all. The fun thing to do was to show them a calculator because they really dug that, you know. 
0:03:44.3  0:03:44.5  FEMALE:  [unintelligible]. 
0:03:45.0  0:04:01.2  MALE:  [unintelligible] it's funny I was [unintelligible] with one of the students and so I [unintelligible] it was still working.  [unintelligible] like, this thing works, you know [laughter].  [unintelligible] you have more calculators for us, uni? 
0:04:00.7  0:04:03.8  FEMALE:  So when did you go back into tutoring?
0:04:04.3  0:04:07.9  MALE: That was after I worked for about three years.  After [unintelligible].
0:04:08.4  0:04:10.8  FEMALE:  It's nice to meet you. 
0:04:09.3  0:04:11.3  MALE: You too.  See you.
