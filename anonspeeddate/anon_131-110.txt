0:04 0:08 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].  Good to meet you.  So, how are things going?  
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Good.  Good.  What department are you from?  
0:11 0:12 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].  
0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  Good.  Are you?  What year are you?  
0:15 0:15 MALE:  I'm second year.  How about you?  
0:24 0:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, okay.  I'm actually a first-year law student.  
0:19 0:20 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  And I'm in the JD/MBA program.  
0:21 0:22 MALE:  Oh, really?  
0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:22 0:24 MALE:  So, when are you going to do your MBA?  
0:32 0:34 FEMALE:  I start at the law school.  
0:26 0:32 MALE:  Oh, okay.  So you basically are doing first year in law school and then you're going to switch over to the MBA.  And like eventually finish with MBA, right?  
0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I do it.  
0:34 0:34 MALE:  Cool.  
0:42 0:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, so you basically do like five years in four.  
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:49 0:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  I think it might be a little more intense than I bargained for.  
0:46 0:47 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  But I hear you guys have a good time over there.  
0:49 0:58 MALE:  No, it's lots of parties.  It's usually [unintelligible], but I don't know if you're considering that or not.  It's very social, the people.  You know, there are always lots of parties.  
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Are you leaving?  
0:58 1:19 MALE:  Yeah, last year.  I see most of the people like about 200 people out of a class size of 370 you end up getting a small group.  It's really lots of fun, a lot of good parties, good barbecues, but it can get kind of intense, like occasionally socially [unintelligible] finale [unintelligible] spending time [unintelligible] campus.  
1:27 1:31 FEMALE:  Were you pretty involved with the [unintelligible] scene?  
1:23 1:24 MALE:  Yeah, I'm drawn.  
1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:26 1:32 MALE:  Around--yeah, [unintelligible] started spending more time with your friends and really getting to know people.  
1:40 1:42 FEMALE:  Yeah, it gets a little older.  
1:35 1:48 MALE:  Yeah, exactly. Are there things to do at the law school?  Like, do you spend a lot of time with your classmates, or do you put together, you know, outside of campus and just kind of go out?  
1:56 2:00 FEMALE:  I mean it's just [unintelligible] law school for one semester.  
1:52 1:52 MALE:  Right.  
2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  You're actually [unintelligible] on quarters.  
1:54 1:54 MALE:  Right.  
2:03 2:05 FEMALE:  You definitely are kind of awkward [unintelligible].  '
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
2:06 2:10 FEMALE:  Especially the first year of law school is really an academically demanding year.  
2:02 2:02 MALE: Yeah.  
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  So, we would basically just kind of [unintelligible] and like never meet students [unintelligible].  
2:06 2:06 MALE:  Right.  
2:14 2:22 FEMALE:  We would like never meet students from [unintelligible]. Wondering like we were the best of friends.  Like one thing that we are just really intimidated is like getting to meet people who aren't law students.  
2:14 2:15 MALE:  Right.  
2:23 2:26 FEMALE:  I mean, gosh, [unintelligible] to admit law students are so boring.  
2:18 2:23 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, like me I can't say that, but I can say the same thing.  I can say that MBA students--
2:31 2:33 FEMALE:  [interposing]  You would get bored of me if you were me.  
2:25 2:34 MALE:  Oh, no, no, I don't think so.  Uhm, MBA students are not like generally they're not boring people.  But you get--we grew tired of them.  
2:43 2:48 FEMALE:  I like--I think this is so much more diverse especially for [unintelligible].  
2:41 2:43 MALE:  Yeah, just [unintelligible] about 35, you know, [unintelligible].  
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  Are you from the abroad?  
2:45 2:54 MALE:  Yeah, I'm from [unintelligible] originally, lived in Europe for about 20, 22 years or something like that.  Then lived in California, on the East Coast, then came back to California.  So...
3:03 3:05 FEMALE:  So, you've really been all over.  
2:58 3:01 MALE:  Yeah, how about you?  Have you ever lived abroad?  
3:10 3:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, actually I--actually I thought that I wanted to work internationally [unintelligible], and I grew up actually in [unintelligible] Bay, but [unintelligible].  
3:11 3:12 MALE:  Oh, really?  
3:20 3:21 FEMALE:  Went to school in Boston.  I lived in Colorado.  
3:14 3:14 MALE:  Right.  
3:23 3:29 FEMALE:  I've lived in Mexico, China.  I mean lived for like a few months.  Not for more than a year.  
3:21 3:22 MALE:  Right.  
3:30 3:38 FEMALE:  I mean I'm really interested in other parts of the world.  You know, I think at some point maybe I would be interested in doing that with some kind of interaction at some level.  
3:31 3:41 MALE:  Yeah, there's a lot of that like--there's a lot of like, well, I think I'm certainly going to be enjoying the--like really from the MBA program that people normally tend to travel over their breaks, over the summer in particular.  
3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  Did you go to [unintelligible]?  
3:43 3:43 MALE:  Not this time.  
3:52 3:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, but it was for the first-year students. 
3:46 3:48 MALE:  No, it was actually the second-years as well.  
3:56 3:56 FEMALE:  Really?  
3:50 4:07 MALE:  Like it was a group of single women and then a group of single, Black guys.  And so--yeah, and like--yeah, it was like those two groups basically didn't make much contact with each other.  It was still lots of fun like being around and looking at what the other group was doing and all that kind of stuff.  Yeah. 
4:16 4:20 FEMALE: That's interesting.  Yeah, no--I'd love to go with a bunch of people who were headed down there.
