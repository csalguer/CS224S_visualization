0:01 0:02 MALE:  Sorry.  This is really...
0:09 0:12 FEMALE:  It's kind of hard to rate a person in a minute.
0:08 0:11 MALE:  On--based on random conversation.
0:15 0:19 FEMALE:  Yeah [laughter].  [unintelligible].
0:19 0:22 MALE:  All right.  I'll finish it later.  I'm male102.
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  Hi.  I'm female124.
0:24 0:25 MALE:  female124?  Nice to meet you.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.
0:27 0:29 MALE:  So what program are you in?
0:33 0:35 FEMALE:  I'm in the [unintelligible].  
0:31 0:32 MALE:  Oh yeah.  How do you like it?
0:37 0:39 FEMALE:  I love it.  It's been a really great year.
0:35 0:35 MALE:  It's an energetic group.
0:40 0:48 FEMALE:  Yes.  We are a very energetic group.  And actually, they're the reason that I'm here [unintelligible].  
0:42 0:42 MALE:  Yeah.
0:48 0:49 FEMALE:  And what about you?
0:45 0:48 MALE:  Uh, I'm also the ED school.  I do, uh, philosophy there.
0:53 0:55 FEMALE:  Oh, nice.  Very good.
0:50 0:55 MALE:  So, yeah.  I sent out all the flurry of emails about the student research conference that's going on.
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  Oh okay.
0:56 0:56 MALE:  So.
1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  Great.
0:57 0:58 MALE:  What is [unintelligible]?
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  How did that turn out?
0:59 1:13 MALE:  It turned out well, in the sense that the people who attended seemed to have a really good experience, and that's good.  I was very ambitious in terms--I thought we'd get like 20 or 30 people at every session, and it ended up being more 10 to 20.
1:18 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But sometimes it's nicer to have like smaller [unintelligible].
1:17 1:24 MALE:  Right.  And I think that was good for the speakers in the sense that it made things a little bit more comfortable, it was a more intimate environment.
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:25 1:26 MALE:  So they got some good [unintelligible] time.
1:30 1:37  FEMALE:  Yeah.  And probably, also, people weren't quite prepared [unintelligible]. 
1:32 1:34 MALE:  Very much so.  Very much so.  But.
1:39 1:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So what type of theme have you been doing research on?  What are you working on [unintelligible]?
1:39 2:03 MALE:  Uh, well it's through philosophy, that it's kind of strange.  It's, uh, basically taking a lot of philosophy classes, and then, sort of thinking philosophically about education issues.  So I'm interested in issues in education research and looking at how people set up research designs, and what the issues are in terms of how values and politics and things like that shape, uh, the way we--
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  Wow.  Yeah.
2:04 2:10 MALE:  --uh, researchers study education.  And it's a big issue right now, for a lot of different reasons.  But you know, it's undefined.
2:15 2:17 FEMALE:  I don't think I've seen a lot of research based on that [unintelligible].
2:13 2:14 MALE:  No, it hasn't--
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] good for you.
2:16 2:26 MALE:  It is good.  I hope it's good.  I hope people say, yeah it's really interesting.  That's the sort of thing we want, so.  But, uh, I'm a second year, so I have probably another two or three years before I'm [unintelligible].
2:30 2:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:27 2:29 MALE:  What'd you do before you came into [unintelligible]?
2:34 2:37 FEMALE:  Um, I was an undergraduate here.  So--
2:32 2:34 MALE:  Oh yeah.  So did you come straight in to--
2:38 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I did.  So it's been a long [unintelligible] for me.  But I really like the Bay Area.  I love the [unintelligible]. 
2:43 2:43 MALE:  Yeah.
2:46 2:49 FEMALE:  So it hasn't really [unintelligible] probably too much to be there that long.
2:45 2:49 MALE:  No, it's a beautiful place.  Before I came here, I was at the University of Illinois for seven years.
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?

2:49 2:57 MALE:  So I was very--in fact, I was thinking I was probably going to stay there for a doctoral program.  And then, at the last minute, I ended up coming out here.  But it's, uh--
3:01 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Did you come to visit in the spring?
2:58 3:00 MALE:  I did.  Yeah.  It was gorgeous.
3:04 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm sure that persuaded you [unintelligible]. 
3:01 3:11 MALE:  It was beautiful. Beautiful.  And what kind of sucked was, I feel like I haven't been able to enjoy as much of it as, uh, I would like to, just because you're so busy with classes and everything.
3:15 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Well you have several more years, so.
3:13 3:13 MALE:  Exactly.  
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  Hopefully you can--
3:13 3:14 MALE:  That's my hope.
3:19 3:23 FEMALE:  What type of things would you like to do that you don't think you're able to do now? 
3:19 3:23 MALE:  I really want to go into some of the national parks out here, and be able to--
3:27 3:27 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:24 3:30 MALE:  I'm just now going and shopping for a bike to go commute.  I'm living in [unintelligible] park now, so--
3:34 3:35 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:30 3:32 MALE:  --to be able to just--there's so many great bike trails.
3:37 3:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Definitely.
3:34 3:47 MALE:  Uh, to get out here, so to do that.  I spent a summer in the city, up in San Francisco, and ended up still working from home most days, and not going out as much as I wanted to do.  But I'd like to be able to spend more time in the city and see things, so.
3:52 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It's just hard for me to maneuver things [unintelligible] some times.
3:53 3:56 MALE:  It requires a lot of planning.
4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:57 3:59 MALE:  [unintelligible].
4:04 4:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I think so.  It was really nice meeting you.
4:01 4:02 MALE:  It was nice meeting you too.
4:08 4:08 FEMALE:  Take care.
4:03 4:04 MALE:  Have fun.
