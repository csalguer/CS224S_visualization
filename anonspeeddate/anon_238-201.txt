00:56  01:01	MALE:  Except especially the end of the questions like courteous.
01:01  01:12	FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  For some people I think the things sort of leap out at you.  You know, it just depends.  But most people I've found courteous is hard to answer, but a couple of people I've had a strong opinion of whether they were courteous you know.  So, who knows.

03:09  03:17	MALE:  Oh, good.  Tell me a movie you like.  Because we are watching movies maybe twice a week and so we never know what to choose.  We have some things, but  --
03:18  03:18	FEMALE:  Right.
03:19  03:21	MALE:  All the time we are arguing about what we should see.  
03:22  03:22	FEMALE:  Yeah you know --

03:52  03:52	MALE:  Yes.
03:53  03:54	FEMALE:  Yeah, I refuse.
03:57  03:59	MALE:  But that would be so bad for you.  I thought I didn't like this guy, but the movie is so much better than everything.
04:00  04:00	FEMALE:  Really.
04:01  04:02	MALE:  I mean you can not just --
04:02  04:02	FEMALE:  I hate him [horn].
04:03  04:08	MALE:  I don't want to say it's a good movie, otherwise you'll be disappointed.  But if you like love stories like my mother you would like
04:09  04:10	FEMALE:  Ah-huh, okay.
04:11  04:11	MALE:  Be really happy. 
04:12  04:16	FEMALE:  Ahh.
04:17  04:18	MALE:  But tell me a movie, no, you don't have any.  I will put you a good mark for intelligent if you know a good movie.
04:18  04:22	FEMALE:  If I have a good movie?  Too much pressure.
04:23  04:25	MALE:  That's okay.  I understand.  Have fun.
