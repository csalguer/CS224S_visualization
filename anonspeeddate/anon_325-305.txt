But those also, this kind of rock, it's not like-- I don't like Keen or those guys or AC/DC. I do one of two sounds and not much, so this is the kind of rock music I refer to.
2:07 2:08 FEMALE: That's awesome.
2:54 2:59 MALE: Of course, I'm originally from Spain so I have similar interests in Spanish music.
2:12 2:15 FEMALE: That's cool. Do you play? I know a lot of people like the guitar and stuff.

3:25 3:38 FEMALE: I like the fact that I'm doing something useful, sort of. Like the day to day is kind of the same, right? Whatever. It's quite as much creativity probably as say a PhD program.
