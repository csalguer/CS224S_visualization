I guess there's a change in thinking in the [unintelligible] as well.  Just, you know, a sneezing theme--I normally get this way, and the feeling changes.  
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  Hay fever, or?  
0:41 0:56 MALE:  Yeah, it seemed for a while I didn't really have a cold after--since I did regular exercise.  However, I guess recently I've been [unintelligible] doing exercises, you know.  
0:48 0:52 FEMALE:  Our dean always says to us, are you exercising?  She says that like to our class--

1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:30 1:31 MALE:  With PhD's.  
1:21 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, there are many Master's students.  There are many here tonight.  
1:34 1:36 MALE:  Oh, I see.  How many do you have?  
1:28 1:33 FEMALE:  Well, like I think there are over 100 a year.  
1:42 1:42 MALE: I see.  
1:35 1:38 FEMALE:  In different maybe more.  I'm not sure because they're different programs.  
1:48 1:51 MALE: Oh, I see so that's almost separate, separate. 
1:43 1:43 FEMALE: Yeah.  
1:52 1:55 MALE: I see.  So, you don't become the principal or something?  
1:47 1:47 FEMALE:  No.  No.  
1:57 1:57 MALE:  I see.  
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  No, I want to be a researcher.  
2:00 2:03 MALE: Uh-huh.  So, you are doing research on which area?  
1:54 1:58 FEMALE:  On higher education.  On under like teaching undergraduates.  
2:07 2:09 MALE: Uh-huh.  I see.  
2:01 2:03 FEMALE: I'm interested in, yeah, college teaching.  What about you?  
2:13 2:16 MALE:  I'm in the business school, also in the PhD program.  
2:07 2:10 FEMALE:  Oh, that's unusual too.  You always meet MBA people.  
2:19 2:20 MALE:  That's right, exactly.  
2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  What's your area of?  
2:23 2:45 MALE: I'm doing finance--finance and [unintelligible].  It's interesting for one economist wrote a paper about the [unintelligible] of education.  So, what he basically said was education has no effect at all for adding to human capital.  
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  Right.  
2:46 2:51 MALE:  It just signals that that person was intellectual from the first.  
2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  Right.  
2:52 3:05 MALE:  So, higher education just separates people.  It just, you know, evidence that he is smart.  It's not like education adds any value, and he got the Nobel Prize by doing that, yeah. 
2:57 3:03 FEMALE:  People who didn't--who gave him the Nobel Prize didn't enjoy their college years maybe.  They didn't think they learned anything.  
3:14 3:14 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:05 3:17 FEMALE:  You know what I think that's very truth.  Like, there is a lot of truth to that--that, you know, people--how much do you remember from college?  You know, like so I think--I think it has a lot to do with social virtues.  
3:27 3:30 MALE:  Oh, I didn't study hard.  I didn't make a difference.  
3:21 3:28 FEMALE:  Right.  That's right.  And so what year are you?  
3:38 3:39 MALE:  I'm in my third year.  
3:31 3:31 FEMALE: Third year?  
3:40 3:45 MALE: The end of third year.  So, I'm getting worried that maybe I shouldn't be here, you know.
