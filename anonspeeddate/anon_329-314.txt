0:00 0:00 MALE:  Test of endurance.
0:11 0:14 FEMALE:  It really is.  This is almost painful.  Well, it is pretty painful actually.

0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  Okay.  Where you from?  What do you do?
0:11 0:14 MALE:  Uh [laughter] I'm from Long Island.  Uh I'm an electrical engineer.  You?
1:01 1:04 FEMALE:  Uh female329.  I am from LA, and I'm in product design.
0:19 0:23 MALE:  Okay.  Great.  Uh and uh you're um masters student--
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  [interposing] Sorry.  I keep covering this.  
0:23 0:23 MALE:  --or a PhD?
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  I'm a masters student.
0:24 0:25 MALE:  Okay.  Great.
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  You?
0:25 0:26 MALE:  Uh I'm a PhD student.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  PhD.  What year?
0:28 0:28 MALE:  Uh about to graduate.
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Oh, you are?
0:29 0:30 MALE:  Fifth year, I guess, so.
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  And what are you going to do?
0:31 0:34 MALE:  Uh I'm interviewing for [unintelligible] position.  So we'll see. 
1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  Oh really?  
0:35 0:35 MALE:  Yeah, we'll see.
1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  Oh exciting.
0:37 0:37 MALE:  [unintelligible] right?
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, good luck.  That's really cool.
0:39 0:42 MALE:  So are you going to do the uh--I mean have you gotten an advisor?  Are you going to--
1:28 1:29 FEMALE:  [interposing] Am I going to do what?
0:43 0:45 MALE:  Are you going to go through the PhD or are you going to--
1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  [interposing] No.  We don't have PhD's in product design.
0:46 0:46 MALE:  Oh, okay.
1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  Product design is kind of weird.
0:47 0:50 MALE:  Mechanical engineers is allied, right?  So you might--
1:36 1:41 FEMALE:  [interposing] So, I mean, I could do ME, but I'm really not into ME.  I'm actually sewing skirts for my thesis.  So as you can tell--
0:55 0:55 MALE:  [interposing] Really?
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  --I'm not very engineering oriented.
0:57 0:59 MALE:  So how are you sewing skirts, automatedly [phonetic]?
1:46 1:51 FEMALE:  Uh I have a machine, sewing machine namely.  I have become a glorified seamstress, and I just sit there and make skirts all day.
1:06 1:06 MALE:  Really?
1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:07 1:08 MALE:  That's sexy skirts?  No?
1:54 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Actually, one of them--well, yeah actually 'cause um I'm being ridiculous.  So the first skirt was a very conservative business skirt except it has a huge fouh [phonetic] red fur.
1:18 1:18 MALE:  Okay.
2:05 2:07 FEMALE:  It's a little weird.  The second one, the one I was working on was for--
1:21 1:26 MALE:  [interposing] That's like uh hmm--it would be appropriate at let's say a dominatrix convention or something like that I guess.
2:12 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, something like that.  So that one was that.  And the second one that I'm doing right now, I just finished, was for salsa dancing.  It didn't work well, but the concept was that if you turn one way, the skirt turns one color.  If you turn one way, it will turn the other color.  It didn't work at all.  There was like--
1:37 1:37 MALE:  [interposing] So--
2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  --a contention.  It didn't work.
1:39 1:39 MALE:  Okay.
2:26 2:27 FEMALE:  I'm very sad.  So I have to rebound.
1:40 1:43 MALE:  How is that supposed to be, like a reflection-type thing?
2:29 2:32 FEMALE:  No.  It's basically um bad material--
1:45 1:46 MALE:  [interposing] Mood sense in the skirt?
2:33 2:33 FEMALE:  No.  
1:47 1:47 MALE:  Okay.
2:33 2:39 FEMALE:  But basically um I put in folds, like I put in pieces that were black that some go this way, some go this way, right?
1:53 1:53 MALE:  Uh-huh.
2:40 2:51 FEMALE:  So depending on their flaps.  So basically depending on which way you turn.  Theoretically, the drag should have pulled them out.  The problem was, as I talked to my aeroaster [phonetic] friends, the drag is not going to compensate for the centrifugal force of--
2:05 2:06 MALE:  [interposing] So what actually happened?
2:52 2:55 FEMALE:  So basically they all flared open.  So you just see all of them.
2:09 2:09 MALE:  Yeah, I see.
2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  It sucks.  So I--
2:10 2:11 MALE:  [interposing] So there--was there skin underneath?
2:58 2:59 FEMALE:  No, no, no.  It's--
2:13 2:14 MALE:  [interposing] Okay, 'cause that would be really funny.
3:00 3:06 FEMALE:  --it's colored.  Yeah, that would be really interesting.  But it's um different colors.  So it's supposed to be different colors depending on which flaps--
2:19 2:19 MALE:  [interposing] I see.
3:06 3:06 FEMALE:  --pulled out.
2:20 2:21 MALE:  So a third attempt was more--
3:08 3:15 FEMALE:  [interposing] So third attempt I haven't done yet, but um I'm going to try to find that one.  But I'm probably going to make the third one to be a [unintelligible] skirt between business and work.
2:29 2:29 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:16 3:20 FEMALE:  So ways in which you can make a skirt be conservative in one position and change it--
2:34 2:35 MALE:  [interposing] So like zipper off the last two inches.
3:21 3:21 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
2:35 2:36 MALE:  There you go.
3:22 3:27 FEMALE:  Something like that.  Actually zippers are a big thing.  I'm actually going to work with zippers a lot for like two or three of my skirts.
2:41 2:44 MALE:  You need to have good sound effects for the zippers, you know.  There needs to be a vocative--yeah, exactly.
3:31 3:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
2:46 2:46 MALE:  Excellent.
3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  That would be fun.  That's what I do.
2:48 2:48 MALE:  Awesome.
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's pretty much it, so.
2:50 2:53 MALE:  So I mean um are you going to get a job with that or--I mean--
3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  [interposing] No, I'm going to starve.
2:55 2:56 MALE:  --commercialize?  Okay.  Okay.  Great.
3:42 3:44 FEMALE:  [laughter].
2:57 2:58 MALE:  That sounds--it's a plan.
3:44 3:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is a plan.  Um I'm going to try to work for--I'm working at Pottery Barn this summer.
3:03 3:03 MALE:  I'm sorry, who?
3:50 3:50 FEMALE:  Pottery Barn.
3:04 3:05 MALE:  Okay.  Oh, okay.
3:51 3:57 FEMALE:  So I'm going to be doing like lighting and stuff like that, and then we'll see how I like it.  If I like it, I might stick around and do more stuff with them.  If I don't like it--
3:10 3:11 MALE:  [interposing] Otherwise back to school?
3:58 4:02 FEMALE:  --move on.  No.  Well, I'm going to do part time school next year anyways, like classes still.
3:16 3:19 MALE:  Oh, so you--you don't complete your masters at the end of this year, the middle of--
4:05 4:10 FEMALE:  [interposing] No.  Yeah, I mean I finished all my requirements, but I'm going to stick around 'cause I'm lazy.  I like school.
3:24 3:24 MALE:  Okay.
4:12 4:12 FEMALE:  One of those things.
3:26 3:26 MALE:  Great.
4:13 4:13 FEMALE:  I--
3:27 3:28 MALE:  [interposing] Hey.  Nice meeting you.
4:14 4:15 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
