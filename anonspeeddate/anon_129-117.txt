0:43 0:46 MALE:  I guess there's no guys in the school of ed.  Is that the way it is?
0:50 1:01 FEMALE:  There are like six of them, and four of them are married, and two are gay.  And that's it.  [laughter]  No one is in there [unintelligible].  No, I shouldn't say that.  There are very few men.  
0:57 0:59 MALE:  Yeah, I was in education actually.  
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  Oh really?  
1:00 1:03 MALE:  And when I was in my program, it was all women.  
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  Okay, do you teach?
1:05 1:08 MALE: I did teach.  I taught elementary school.  Now, I'm in law school, but--
1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  But you did teach.  Where did you teach?  
1:11 1:13 MALE:  I taught in Chicago and in Florida actually.  
1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Cool.  What grade?
1:16 1:18 MALE:  Third grade was my main, but--
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I taught second for a few years.  
1:19 1:23 MALE:  Did you?  So you taught and now you're coming back for ed policy?
1:27 1:29 FEMALE: Policy and organization.  
1:26 1:27 MALE: So, what are you going to do?  Are you going to be a principal?  
1:33 1:34 FEMALE: No way.  Who wants to be a principal?
1:30 1:33 MALE: I actually got a degree to be a principal while I was teaching.
1:37 1:37 FEMALE: And then you were like--
1:34 1:54 MALE: [interposing]  And I wanted to be a principal.  Well, I kind of wanted to do it though, but then I thought--I just, cause I worked like in the city and saw how just how inequalities really bothered me.  So, I was like, well, I'm going to go to law school and see what I can do about it that way. And I might come back and be a principal down the line, but so.  
1:59 1:59 FEMALE: The world needs that.  
1:56 1:57 MALE: So, what are you going to do?  
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  I don't want to do it.  
1:58 1:58 MALE: What are you going to do?  
2:04 2:15 FEMALE:  I'm actually looking at non-profit work actually, sort of urban school reform from alternative [unintelligible], which is really nice.  [unintelligible] it just didn't come out right.  
2:11 2:15 MALE:  Yeah, well it's funny.  I almost took a job at a school reform organization.

2:44 2:47 MALE:  Really?  Uh, I should have taken it.  I wish I would have.  
2:51 3:01 FEMALE:  It's his first year here.  The dean of the ed school actually told me last week that [unintelligible] from Chicago, he said there was nobody he wanted [unintelligible].  He said you better be good.  Tony laughed.  
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Oh really?

3:47 3:47 FEMALE:  A big one?  
3:44 3:55 MALE:  Yeah, it's a big one, but it's actually just opening up an office in Chicago so I think I'm going to have a lot of say in--like the managing partner said I could bring any pro bono project I wanted.  He would just rubber stamp it.  
3:59 4:02 FEMALE: Okay, I could go offer you my dad's [unintelligible].
