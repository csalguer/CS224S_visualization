0:00 0:03 MALE:  Oh, my god, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
0:02 0:07 FEMALE:  No, no, no, no, no, no problem [laughter].  How you doing?
0:07 0:14 MALE:  Um, I feel relieved. [laughter] we're going to get this out of the uh, business end of this out of the conversation.
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  No, no.
0:16 0:17 MALE:  No.
0:17 0:20 FEMALE:  It's really exciting, you should have done a nice laugh flash [laughter].
0:19 0:28 MALE:  Yeah, um, yeah, so how are you doing?   Are you feeling more like energized and ready to head off into the rest of the night?
0:29 0:31 FEMALE:  Yeah, [laughter].
0:31 0:32 MALE: Yeah, me too.   I'm just asking, I knew that.
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  I have a ton of work tomorrow.
0:34 0:36  MALE:  Yeah, right, yeah.
0:36 0:38 FEMALE:  Going straight to the library afterward.
0:38 0:45 MALE:  Like, a normal date, like, you can sort of leave early, if you know, things aren't going well.  But here you have to stay until the very end you know.
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  I feel bad sitting here [unintelligible].
0:47 0:48 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:48 0:55 FEMALE:  Because there's [unintelligible].  [laughter] like make stuff up when you're writing these things.
0:55 1:02 MALE:  You know I don't, I don't even understand half the questions to be honest, like, assertive? What is, what is that, that mean?   I don't know.
1:03 1:07 FEMALE: [unintelligible].  It's like I'm going to push that out after like four minutes.
1:06 1:32 MALE:  I don't understand ambitious either.  I didn't know like, like, a lot of these it's like, if someone just like really, really not ambitious, you know, like they don't do anything, that would be kind of, you know, not a very appealing quality.  But like, in general, who cares?  And everyoneat Stanford is going to be ambitious enough.  I guess if you had to like someone who is really ambitious, that's kind of crazy, but, um, so.  And then intelligent, like...
1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  By default shouldn't we all be intelligent [laughter]?
1:34 1:52 MALE:  Yes, exactly.  And the thing about sincere is like; I'm not good, you know everyone's being sincere and no one is being sincere.  You know what I mean, like.  Like, I don't know, I'm, I'm, I've given everyone a high rating for sincerity, but like, I feel like I'm getting,  I'm getting dubbed you know. But I don't care, you know.  It's like...
1:54 2:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, now, I mean I think, I can actually see sincerity because I've met people mostly from business school, not here, but just like in the class.
2:00 2:01 MALE:  Yeah.
2:02 2:04 FEMALE:  And they're pretty slick when they get that, like...
2:04 2:05 MALE:  They're pretty what?
2:05 2:13 FEMALE:  Slick, like, I mean they're easy to talk to, but you also kind of get the feeling that they're looking at you as a resume or like as a business contact and not, well, really a person.
2:14 2:15 MALE:  I see, oh.
2:16 2:21 FEMALE:  I think that I would probably rate them kind of low on sincere if they were here [laughter].  But they're not [laughter].
2:21 2:22 MALE:  How do you, how do you think I'm going to do?
2:22 2:37 FEMALE:  Hmm, I think that you're really sincere actually.  I mean the fact that we're like dissecting this, like totally, like, [laughter].  I think like, I don't understand any of these questions [laughter].  I probably should just [unintelligible] keep it down [laughter].  [Inaudible].
2:36 2:44 MALE:  No, no, no, no, I'm sure they want to hear like; most of my conversations tonight have been about the, the project.  You know, because like...
2:45 2:46 FEMALE:  That's what we have in common?
2:46 2:48 MALE:  That's something that we can bond over, you know?
2:49 2:51 FEMALE:  [laughter] oh...
2:51 2:54 MALE:  But um, but...

3:07 3:11 MALE:  My parents', my parents' are Jewish, so they just, they gave me a Hebrew name.
3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  Are you Jewish?
3:12 3:13 MALE:  Um, yeah, I guess so
3:14 3:15 FEMALE:  [laughter] is it by default?
