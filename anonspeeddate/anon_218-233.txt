0:27 0:31 MALE:  There is no zero here that is a good one.  I think the room has gotten like twice as loud ever since everyone took a break it's like people have like--they come back with like all of this strength all of a sudden.

0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

0:34 0:34 MALE:  It's like--it's like people have like relaxed out.  Hi, I'm male218.

0:45 0:51 FEMALE:  female233.

0:51 0:52 MALE:  Was that okay pronunciation?

0:52 0:53 FEMALE:  That's perfect.

0:54 0:58 MALE:  female233.  Okay.  Um, uh, I--I--yeah, I speak a little bit of Spanish, so I've go the little bit of the R flip.  That helps a little bit.  I actually speak a little bit of Russian, so the Arian [unintelligible] I could do a little bit of it, yeah.

0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:59 1:02 MALE:  Yeah.  A little--where are you originally from?

1:02 1:10 FEMALE:  From Mexico.

1:10 1:23 MALE:  Nice.  Nice.  I'm originally from Colorado.  Yeah.  Yeah, so what are you up to here, female233?

1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Um, I am doing my Ph.D. in law school.

1:24 1:34 MALE:  In which school?

1:35 1:36 FEMALE:  Law school.

1:37 1:37 MALE:  Law school, wow.  Um, so how long does the Ph.D. program take?

1:37 1:53 FEMALE:  Four.

1:53 1:53 MALE:  Four years.  And what year are you in right now?

1:54 1:57 FEMALE:  Second.

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Second year.  That's cool.  I'm in my third year right now and usually it takes us about seven or eight, so we're--I'm in the Russian language and literature program [unintelligible].  So, it--so, it usually takes us, you know, like the Russians are usually like a little behind everybody else.  And so we try to imitate that into like our--our academic program by being a lot slower as far as graduating.  We have had, like, you know, ninth and tenth years still sitting around in my department.

1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Really?

2:00 2:01 MALE:  Um, no seriously, seriously, ninth and tenth years.  So, third year like it feels like I'm just like in the very beginning right now seriously.  So, where--where in Mexico are you from?

2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  I am from Durango.

2:02 2:03 MALE:  Okay.  

2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  That is [unintelligible].

2:04 2:04 MALE:  Okay.  I have been to the Durango in Colorado, which was named after that Durango.

2:04 2:05 FEMALE:  Oh, yes.

2:05 2:06 MALE:  Yeah.  It's a--it's probably not as cool as the actual like Mexican Durango.

2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, I mean, Durango is [unintelligible] everything was [unintelligible], but you actually [unintelligible].  My family is there and [unintelligible] we have a ranch.  And [unintelligible] go there [unintelligible].

2:07 2:08 MALE:  Oh, nice.  I mean, if you've got a ranch.

2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:09 2:11 MALE:  I mean, so why would you come to California, I mean, if you've got a ranch down there?

2:11 2:12 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] because I don't got [unintelligible].

2:12 2:14 MALE:  So, which--I--I better question it because people often times complain that like Stanford, you know, it's like there isn't anything you're [unintelligible], which feels to you more isolated from like--like--like--like--like civilization Stanford or [unintelligible]?

2:15 2:23 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  

2:23 2:24 MALE:  Because it almost feels like we're pretty far away.

2:24 2:28 FEMALE:  But--but the thing at Stanford is that it's a--you know, [unintelligible] everything within.  But you don't actually meet people [unintelligible].

2:29 2:30 MALE:  I guess so, yeah.

2:30 2:33 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] isolated because [unintelligible].

2:34 2:35 MALE:  I guess because it's so self-sufficient.

2:35 2:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:39 2:40 MALE:  But it seems like a little bit like--like sort of deceptively so, right?  Because it's sort of one [unintelligible] division, but I think if you never leave like the area you might--I think people actually go crazy.

2:40 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah, and [unintelligible].

2:42 2:43 MALE:  I think there is actually a clinical condition if you don't leave for like three months like there is no--there is like no chance of like keeping it together.

2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  I [unintelligible].

2:44 2:46 MALE:  So, how do you like California?  Have you been--have you been here for long?

2:47 2:51 FEMALE:  Only from the past two years.

2:51 2:51 MALE:  Oh, really.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  

2:52 2:55 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

2:55 2:59 MALE:  Yeah, it must be good to get a chance to practice your Spanish every once in a while. 

2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

2:59 3:00 MALE:  Yeah, that's cool.  I--I studied two years of Spanish.  My Spanish is just so bad it's embarrassing.

3:00 3:03 FEMALE:  [laughter].

3:04 3:06 MALE:  Like way back in like seventh and eighth grade.

3:06 3:15 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] oh, well, at least you [unintelligible].

3:15 3:16 MALE:  Yeah, well, what are you--what are you going to do?

3:17 3:22 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] Colorado.

3:23 3:23 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  Where were you in Colorado?

3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  Vail.

3:24 3:24 MALE:  Where?

3:25 3:27 FEMALE:  Vail.

3:27 3:30 MALE:  Vail, yeah.  My, uh, my aunt lives up there.  Yeah, it's a really nice area, isn't it?

3:30 3:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible].

3:33 3:33 MALE:  [unintelligible] you liked it.  You--you seem a little bit reserved about it, yeah. 

3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Yeah [unintelligible] I broke my knee [unintelligible].

3:35 3:38 MALE:  You broke your knee?

3:39 3:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:41 3:49 MALE:  How long have you been [unintelligible]?

3:50 3:51 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

3:51 3:52 MALE:  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, you--oh, you didn't--you're not serious.  Because I totally--you're not serious?

3:52 3:59 FEMALE:  No, I'm very serious.

4:00 4:10 MALE:  Oh, you are serious.

4:11 4:11 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

4:11 4:12 MALE:  That is awful.

4:12 4:13 FEMALE:  No, but I loved the place.
