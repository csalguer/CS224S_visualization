0:01:05.6  0:01:07.8  MALE:  That's right.   What I went to Wesleyan actually. 
0:01:05.9  0:01:07.1  FEMALE:  You did? 
0:01:08.9  0:01:11.5  MALE:  Yeah.  I went here in undergraduate but on our college tour we went to Wesleyan. 
0:01:10.7  0:01:11.7  FEMALE:  You went to Wesleyan. 
0:01:13.0  0:01:13.5  MALE:  Yep. 
0:01:11.9  0:01:14.0  FEMALE:  You were an undergrad at Wesleyan
0:01:14.7  0:01:15.7  MALE:  No, no. 
0:01:13.9  0:01:14.5  FEMALE:  Oh. 
0:01:16.5  0:01:17.7  MALE:  No, when I was looking for colleges--
0:01:16.1  0:01:16.5  FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh.
0:01:17.9  0:01:19.3  MALE:  --I went to Wesleyan.  I was undergrad here.
0:01:18.0  0:01:18.6  FEMALE:  Oh, you were undergrad here.
0:01:20.3  0:01:20.9  MALE:  Yeah, in '99. 
0:01:19.1  0:01:20.7  FEMALE:  I'm just tired. 
0:01:22.7  0:01:25.0  MALE:  I'ts okay.  [laughter]  you got a long ways to go.
0:01:23.2  0:01:25.2  FEMALE:  Oh, shit [laughter]. 
0:01:26.9  0:01:45.5  MALE:  So ah, we all do though.  So we're in the same boat.  Um, well I'm male315 and I was ah, except for '99, I went to New York and worked in a bank.  And I was transfered to Paris.  I had to work in Paris the last four years.  And now I'm back at the business school where I know this character.  So that's about it.  And I'm originally from San Diego.
0:01:43.9  0:01:44.4  FEMALE:  Um-hmm. 
0:01:46.3  0:01:48.8  MALE:  And ah, yeah.  I'm just here to have a good time. 
0:01:47.2  0:01:51.1  FEMALE:  Cool.  So like what is your specialty in business?  Like what are you interested in? 
0:01:52.5  0:02:06.6  MALE:  Ah, well, I, I've always enjoyed work in finance.  But um, I choice Stanford just because of the general managment focus actually.  So it's more just strategic managment rather than [unintelligible] finance focus, which is fine for me. 
0:02:05.4  0:02:34.2  FEMALE:  Um, what--I've never been to France before. And I, I'm one of those people who doesn't want to put a place on a pedestal just because the media tells me it is.  I would, I would--let's just say, if I were in France, if I went to Paris, I could have the best time with um, like a ten dollar budget.  I know they francs; I'm just saying.  I don't know what the conversion is.  But like on a ten dollar budget I could have a great time.  I could go get a piece of bread.  I could go into shops and just have fun looking at stuff.  I wouldn't need to buy stuff. 
0:02:35.8  0:02:41.7  MALE:  That's a great way to live. I figured if you have that attitude about life you're ahead of the game, aren't you, so.
0:02:40.6  0:02:42.3  FEMALE:  Maybe, I don't know.  I mean, my best friend's the opposite, super diva, [unintelligible]. 
0:02:47.6  0:02:53.2  MALE:  And did you have--when did you graduate from Wesleyan? 
0:02:47.6  0:02:53.9  FEMALE:  Um, 2001. 
0:02:55.2  0:03:01.7  MALE:  2001, so then--and you're just--if you're doing your MA that means you started this year at that or last year at this school?
0:02:59.5  0:03:06.4  FEMALE:  Um, I [unintelligible] first I earned [unintelligible] 2002 and then this one. 
0:03:07.9  0:03:09.1  MALE:  So did you go to school ever since or...?
0:03:08.6  0:03:09.3  FEMALE:  Kind of.  Yeah. 
0:03:10.9  0:03:13.5  MALE:  Wow.  Really.  Where did you do your first master's?
0:03:11.5  0:03:13.1  FEMALE:  Um, Harvard School of Education. 
0:03:15.1  0:03:16.8  MALE:  You're getting two master's of education. Wow. 
0:03:15.3  0:03:32.6  FEMALE:  Yes.  I don't know why.  Things just happen the way they do sometimes.  That one was individualized so I dabbled in many differnt departments of art and education. Um, human development and psychology, administration policy, you know, blah, blah, blah, history, da, da, da.  But now I have a focus and I want to do student affairs work. 
0:03:33.9  0:03:35.6  MALE:  Okay.  Yeah. 
0:03:33.6  0:03:40.5  FEMALE:  So um, I'm scrambling right now trying to still get a job, you know, as a student affairs officer, specifically in multi-cultural affairs. 
0:03:42.6  0:03:43.3  MALE:  Here at Stanford or...? 
0:03:42.3  0:03:43.8  FEMALE:  It's pretty hard to get a job at Stanford. 
0:03:45.5  0:03:46.1  MALE:  Is it? 
0:03:44.4  0:03:51.5  FEMALE:  I will try and continue to try.  But maybe it'd be nice to be at a less, a more laid-back, less pressured environment. 
0:03:53.2  0:03:57.3  MALE:  Yeah.  Would you like to stay in California or are you willing to travel anywhere? 
0:03:55.7  0:03:56.4  FEMALE:  I'm willing to travel. 
0:03:57.7  0:03:58.7  MALE:  yeah. 
0:03:57.3  0:03:57.5  FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:03:58.7  0:04:00.2  MALE:  It was a pleasure meeting you.
0:03:58.9  0:03:59.7  FEMALE:  Nice to meet you, too.
