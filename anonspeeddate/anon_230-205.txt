1:44 1:46 FEMALE: Uh sheet music actually, 'cause I like to sing and play piano.

1:48 1:49 MALE: Okay.  

1:47 1:49 FEMALE: Piano would be out in the desert island, though, I doubt it.

1:51 1:52 MALE: Why not?  You have three things.

1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Uh--

1:54 1:56 MALE: I'll even throw in the sheet music on the piano as a [unintelligible] bonus.

2:07 2:08 MALE: Your TiVo.

2:06 2:18 FEMALE: We--she--it was, it was nameX who brought the TiVo into our house, and now we all can't do without it.  Watching copious series like Law and Order.  Don't tell her I told you this.  Don't--do not--you are not allowed to repeat conversations.

2:19 2:20 MALE: Oh I can't, okay.

2:18 2:20 FEMALE: But I--but you're not allowed to.  [unintelligible].

2:21 2:23 MALE: Of course, it's all confidential.  Yes.

2:22 2:29 FEMALE: But now we're all watching uh Law and Order, like, that kind of thing.  We have like seven episodes straight in our TiVo.  

2:30 2:31 MALE: Where are you from?

2:29 2:30 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore.  

2:32 2:33 MALE: Oh Singapore.

2:31 2:32 FEMALE: Where are you from?

2:34 2:35 MALE: New York.

2:33 2:34 FEMALE: One my favorite cities [unintelligible].

2:36 2:37 MALE: Really?

2:35 2:36 FEMALE: I've worked there two summers.

2:38 2:39 MALE: Okay.  

2:37 2:43 FEMALE: In a row.  Uh I went to Yale, so we were in New York all the time.  What I like best is the food is good, firstly, and second--

2:44 2:46 MALE: Mm-hmm.  Best of everything.

2:44 2:57 FEMALE: There's a restaurant under every--I swear every building is a restaurant.  Like, the bottom floor.  It looks that way.  And secondly there's so much to do that you never get tired of it.  Every part is a different thing to do, a different thing to see, and then the different areas are so different?  Which, which part did you live in?

3:00 3:02 MALE: Uh well my folks were on the Upper East Side.

2:59 3:00 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.  

3:02 3:03 MALE: And I lived in the Village.

3:00 3:01 FEMALE: Oh one of those, huh?

3:03 3:04 MALE: Yes.

3:01 3:02 FEMALE: Ah.

3:04 3:05 MALE: I lived in the Village

3:03 3:07 FEMALE: Hence your--hence your general tendency to laugh at everything, want to make jokes with everything.

3:08 3:10 MALE: Pretty much, and be very cynical.

3:08 3:09 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:10 3:11 MALE: And yes.

3:09 3:10 FEMALE: [unintelligible].

3:11 3:14 MALE: It's a real problem on the West Coast.  Not everybody gets it.

3:13 3:16 FEMALE: [unintelligible] people like, [unintelligible] maybe they don't have that so much, you think?

3:20 3:21 MALE: No I think we're all, I think we're all angry.

3:18 3:20 FEMALE: Oh you wouldn't know [unintelligible] really?  [laughter] 

3:24 3:26 MALE: We're all angry and bitter.  Uh all [unintelligible].  No I like it here though.

3:24 3:28 FEMALE: What made you come all the way here?  Were your folks mad?  I say--I left one of my friends--

3:30 3:31 MALE: Were my folks mad?

3:28 3:48 FEMALE: No, one of my friends, nameX, at Yale--I went to Yale, and uh, I went to stay with his family over a summer once for two weeks because I was out of a dorm at the time.  His mom was railing at people in California in general and how they are soft and, like, you know, they chose the easy way out, whereas her in New York we actually, like, know how to live life, like, to the core, you know.

3:50 3:52 MALE: See that's a problem though 'cause I'm falling for the Bay Area already and I want to stay.

3:51 3:55 FEMALE: [laughter] I think it's--I mean, New York's great, but the weather is much better--people are happier here.

3:56 3:57 MALE: Exactly.

3:55 3:56 FEMALE: People really are happier.

3:58 4:01 MALE: I don't care about the happiness thing, but the weather's really good, and, like--

3:58 3:59 FEMALE: Yeah.  

4:02 4:03 MALE: I just like the vibe.  [horn] 

4:01 4:05 FEMALE: You are [unintelligible] [horn] that just cling to your [unintelligible] chains, aren't you.  [laughter] 

4:07 4:08 MALE: We've been cut off.

4:07 4:08 FEMALE: It happens for everyone.  Nice to meet you.

4:11 4:12 MALE: It was very nice to meet you too, female230.

4:09 4:12 FEMALE: Do not repeat to--I'll kill you.  Do not repeat to [unintelligible].

4:14 4:16 MALE: No, no problem.  Hey nameX--no, I'm sorry, just kidding.  All right.

4:13 4:15 FEMALE: [laughter]
