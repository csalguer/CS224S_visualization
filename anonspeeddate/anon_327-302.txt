0:01 0:03 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
0:03 0:08 FEMALE: Oh G, yes [laughter].  It's a good thing to write that down in the very beginning.

0:11 0:14 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, male302 [laughter].  How's everything going with you?
0:11 0:12 MALE: Hey, what does assertive mean?
0:17 0:24 FEMALE: Um, I guess someone who's kind of forward, or, you know, like really kind of directs the conversation in a way.
0:21 0:21 MALE: Oh okay.
0:26 0:26 FEMALE: Like--
0:22 0:22 MALE: Like--
0:27 0:28 FEMALE: Not pushy.  Not aggressive.

0:30 0:32 FEMALE: Yeah.  Like, um--
0:29 0:29 MALE: Okay.
0:34 0:37 FEMALE: It's kind of like a lesser person of aggressive.  You know what I mean?
0:34 0:43 MALE: Okay.  Yes.  So I have to be careful 'cause I [laughter] didn't, I didn't think at all that--I thought it means someone who say, uh, this is how it is and that's it.  Like--
0:48 0:50 FEMALE:  Well that's part of it. It could be that too.
0:46 0:48 MALE: Because that is [unintelligible] assertion?

0:56 0:56 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:52 0:53 MALE: --[unintelligible] assertion.
0:57 1:03 FEMALE: Well I mean, I think that's like part of it.  But it's more the, you know, kind of forward and--
0:59 0:59 MALE: Okay.
1:03 1:03 FEMALE: You know.
1:00 1:02 MALE: It's less the [unintelligible].
1:06 1:12 FEMALE: Yeah.  I think so.  It's definitely a toned down version of aggressive, so.  Yeah.
1:09 1:16 MALE: That's kind of funny, because the three--I know you, and the next person, and then the [unintelligible] next person--
1:16 1:20 FEMALE: You do.  How funny that is.  So yeah.
1:19 1:19 MALE: So what's up?
