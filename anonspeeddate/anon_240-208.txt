1:14 1:15 FEMALE:  Awesome, wow.
1:15 1:23 MALE:  But I have to get a visa to work here.  So I can't actually work before October.  So I have to think of something to do for those three or four months after I graduate.
1:23 1:25 FEMALE:  Do nothing [laughter].
1:25 1:26 MALE:  What would you do?
1:26 1:27 FEMALE:  You should just enjoy yourself.

1:35 1:37 MALE:  Have you done a lot of traveling before?
1:37 1:49 FEMALE:  I have, I have, I've traveled around China before.  Um, but I've never been to Mexico.  I have a friend in Mexico who I was like, I really want to go and visit.  That's what I'd do like straight off the bat, like, I'm going to Mexico [laughter].
1:49 1:54 MALE:  I love, yeah I love traveling so, that's probably what I will do.  I'm thinking of going to Africa though.
1:54 1:55 FEMALE:  Oh, that would be amazing.
1:56 2:02 MALE:  Yeah.  And uh, so what do you do outside of school?  Like what are you passionate about?
2:03 2:13 FEMALE:  I guess, I don't know, the things that I do are pretty mundane [laughter].  Like, I like to read and hang out with friends and throw dinner parties.  I actually just threw a dinner party on Sunday.  And I cooked [laughter].
2:13 2:13 MALE:  Oh, wow.
2:13 2:16 FEMALE:  So I was pretty happy with the [unintelligible] that I [unintelligible] [laughter].
2:17 2:18 MALE:  How many people were there for your dinner party?
2:19 2:30 FEMALE:  There was only like 10, actually it was really casual.  Like if I had messed up all the food, like everyone would just be like, no big deal.  We'll just eat hors d'oeurves, like [laughter].  But um, I made a white sauce for the pasta that I'm really proud of [laughter].
2:30 2:34 MALE:  Nice, that's about all I can do I think.  I don't cook a lot [laughter].
2:32 2:34 FEMALE:  That's about all I can do too [laughter].
2:35 2:37 MALE:  [unintelligible] nameX's is my favorite place.
2:37 2:42 FEMALE:  That's the right place to shop too, so.  But, if you want a recipe for white sauce, I now know how to make it.
2:42 2:45 MALE:  So what's the best question that you've heard tonight that you want to ask me?
2:46 2:58 FEMALE:  I really don't have a best question I've heard today, but, actually there was this one guy who um.  [laughter] he said to me, he's like, you shouldn't be here.  And like kind of just like insulted me here, and I just like--
2:58 2:59 MALE:  Oh, that could have been a compliment.
2:59 3:05 FEMALE:  No, it was definitely kind of insulting because afterwards he was like, oh I shouldn't have said that.  And I just like...
3:05 3:05 MALE:  Oh.
3:06 3:10 FEMALE:  [laughter] like, he kind of apologized afterwards, but I don't know.
3:09 3:12 MALE:  I would have probably taken that as a compliment, but.
3:12 3:24 FEMALE:  Um, well, it really wasn't.  Like I know that saying it out of context, like it sounds like it could be a compliment.  But like if you had been there, listening in on, you'd see [unintelligible] [laughter], like it was just like, oh, that kind guy was kind of [unintelligible].
3:24 3:26 MALE:  Sure it's his problem; it's definitely not your problem.
3:25 3:34 FEMALE:  [laughter] oh, thanks [laughter].  So that my ego's not crushed after this speed dating event and I'm like never again, never again [laughter].
3:31 3:40 MALE:  [laughter] wow, I don't know.  This is definitely my first time.  And I actually find it real interesting.  It's quite an art.
3:39 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah [laughter] it's like, kind of an interesting experience, like that's what [unintelligible] so.
3:45 3:51 MALE:  If you don't meet people in bars, it's like, which I don't do very well.  So, it's like  definitely good practice [laughter].
3:49 3:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't, yeah, totally.
3:52 3:55 MALE:  But here, I guess you can at least hear someone.  Really nice to meet you.
3:53 3:56 FEMALE:  [laughter] nice meeting you.
