0:00:32.5  0:00:30.0  FEMALE:  Ah, you're the first person who offered food.  You're the first person who offered food.  Okay.  So my name's female321. 
0:00:30.6  0:00:32.7  MALE: Hey, why don't you start?  Tell me a little bit about yoursel. 
0:00:32.5  0:01:49.5  FEMALE: [laughter].  I'm sorry.  I'm just used to the like, you know, at this point, like this is good for [unintelligible] research.  I'm used to, I'm used to like, you know, by this point there's like ten things that you've like been asked to say so many times.  And you just get in the mode.  You just start doing it like a motor.  Okay.  I'll try to be quick because I want to hear about other people too and not take up too much time.  Okay. I'm from around here, six miles north of here.  Ah, went to [unintelligible] School as a high school student, in Palmetto.  Major is--I mean in college--was culture anthropology.  Doing my second masters in education.  My first is um, back in the east coast.  Um, my focus right now is higher education issues women of color are facing when they're applying to prestigious graduate schools, such as the ones here.  Um, I'm, I'm an artist.  I'm a dancer, poet, um, writer, comedian.  Not that like I say those in big letters.  I just do it for fun.  I think that's, that's, that's the true, the true pleasure of art is not, not to get all obsessed with, you know, um, just, I don't know.  Just like all this formality and like, like, I don't know.  I like to do it just to do it.  Just to live art.  Anyway... 
0:01:49.8  0:01:50.6  MALE: What's your favorite museum in New York? 
0:01:51.3  0:02:43.5  FEMALE:  I don't know.  See, I'm not like one of those like, high--I'm not a high art person.  [laughter].  I'm on the corner.  No.  Um, I had fun at the Metropolitian Museum of Art.  I don't know.  Honestly I don't have very much experience in museums and stuff.  But I beleive that you can philosophise that--you can make a place a museum.  You can make your room a museum.  I want to like, do weird art.  Like just get my foot print and just do it in weird ways all over my room.  Not literally like on my walls.  But like on peices of paper.  And like make a state--you can just make a statement out of, out of anything.  I love to paint with nailpolish.  Like, I trace pictures of my friends, um, um, pictures of my friends onto another peice of paper and then like paint those in with nailpolish.  And the way it dries, beautiful and weird.  Kind of like melts my brain cells.  The, the, the, you know, the--
0:02:43.8  0:02:44.2  MALE:  Oh, yeah. 
0:02:44.2  0:02:46.3  FEMALE:  The nailpolish smell.  Whatever. It's okay.
0:02:46.3  0:02:47.5  MALE:  Just open the windows and do it. 
0:02:48.3  0:02:52.0  FEMALE:  Yeah.  It still burns my head off.  But it's okay.  Anyway. 
0:02:52.2  0:02:53.1  MALE:  What kind of music do you like? 
0:02:53.3  0:03:06.2  FEMALE:  Um, all kinds of music except I'm ignorant about country and I'm ignorant about--that's what I'd rather--I think it's appropriate to say I'm ignorant about country.  I'm ignorant about orchestra or whatever, like classical music, orchestra.  You know what I'm saying.
0:03:06.2  0:03:07.0  MALE:  [unintelligible] singer. 
0:03:07.3  0:03:30.1  FEMALE:  I used to be.  When I was a kid I was obsessed with Pearl Jam.  Now I um, um, I don't really have anybody I'm obsessed with.  But I think Missy Elliot is pretty adorable and funny and crazy.  I like hip-hop.  I love to dance to hip-hop.  And so--I um, I um, I'm friends with a womens band in San Francisco that's really cool.  They're called Bon Iva [phonetic].  And they have like this Sly and Family Stone/Tina Turner sound. 
0:03:30.5  0:03:31.1  MALE:  Really? 
0:03:31.3  0:04:26.5  FEMALE:  And the lead singer, any guy would like do anything for her.  She's so hot.  And she's, she's, she's so sexy.  And it's so fun to see them.  They're such nice people.  And they have no image complex.  And so I feel really blessed to know them.  And I hope to meet more people like that.  Um, music, I kind of like U2.  Um, I like the kind of like--see, I don't want to get way too random artsy.  But I like--there's some songs--you know how like there's those random top ten on VH1 or something that like nobody really remembers but they vaugely remember.  Those are the kind of songs that sometimes really get me.  And I have an iPod and I'd love to put like, 50 more songs on there that are just from random--cool stuff from when I was in third grade or whatever.  But I can't think of it at the moment.  That's the thing.  That's what's so great about art.  They, they, they bring up some [unintelligible] memory in you but you can't remember.  And I didn't let you say anything, dude.  Sucks.  [laughter].  okay. 
0:04:27.4  0:04:28.4  MALE:  It's kind of nice getting to know you.
0:04:29.0  0:04:29.6  FEMALE:  Thanks.
0:04:29.7  0:04:30.9  MALE:  But you really didn't get to learn much about me.
0:04:31.1  0:04:34.6  FEMALE:  This is something that uni.  Where'd you go to school?  No, where--
0:04:34.5  0:04:34.7  MALE:  Right here.
0:04:34.8  0:04:40.8  FEMALE:  Cool.  I mean, why'd I say that because it doesn't matter [laughter].  But...
