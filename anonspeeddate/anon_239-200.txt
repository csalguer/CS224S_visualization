0:12 0:14 MALE:  So would you like to go first or?
0:14 0:20 FEMALE:  Sure, okay.  Quick, let's see.  I'm a master's student in product design.  It's a small division in the mechanical engineering department.
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Oh, very nice.
0:21 0:23 FEMALE:  First year and I'll um, two year program.
0:23 0:23 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:23 0:25 FEMALE:  Did my undergrad in mechan [phonetic] engineering as well.
0:25 0:26 MALE:  Yeah.
0:26 0:32 FEMALE:  MIT.  I'm from St Louis Missouri and uh, I don't know.  Yeah, that's about it.
0:33 0:34 MALE:  Good job, excellent.  Fellow engineer.
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, what about you?
0:35 0:36 MALE:  Aeronautics [unintelligible]
0:36 0:37 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:37 0:44 MALE:  And so uh, actually in the experimental physics department, enhancing a big long accelerator right uh...your in like tournament right?
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  Yep.
0:45 0:50 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, just uh, the big long accelerator, the end stations are those big dome buildings they look like big lodges.
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, I've never been in those.
0:51 0:55 MALE:  Oh, it's okay.  Engineering satellite in the ship.
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:57 1:01 MALE:  And uh, grew up in the plains of Colorado on a small farm, pretty much in the middle of nowhere.
1:01 1:02 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:02 1:12 MALE:  Nearest neighbor was a mile or two away kind of a deal.  Undergraduate uh, University of Colorado.  [unintelligible] chance to come out here and try to work with satellites.
1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  Oh, good, how long you been out here?
1:15 1:16 MALE:  Four years.
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  PhD program?
1:17 1:20 MALE:  Well, originally but I ended up doing the engineers degree instead.
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:21 1:29 MALE:  Uh, got my thesis signed in December this winter quarter, spring quarter has been just working in the lab, doing research, it's been nice, nice [unintelligible].
1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  Oh, so I don't get it, are you graduating then?
1:31 1:32 MALE:  Yeah, I graduate in January, well in June.
1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
1:34 1:38 MALE:  So, basically everything is completed so I just got to walk across the [unintelligible].
1:37 1:39 FEMALE:  Great, what are you uh, what are you doing afterward?
1:40 1:46 MALE:  Well, I'm hoping to stick around for a while and do some more research in the lab.  If I get a chance maybe work for NASA, JPL or something like that.
1:47 1:50 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, okay, lot of good stuff around here, you know, this is the area.
1:50 1:53 MALE:  Well, yeah, it's a very nice area.  When the projects interesting, that's really what I want.
1:54 1:55 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:55 2:03 MALE:  So, that's a little bit about myself.  Since you're an engineering student, I'm probably mind mention this, but what does an engineering, what do you get to do for fun on weekends?
2:04 2:17 FEMALE:  Oh, [laughter], um, I play a lot of sports.  I do a lot of, uh, my, my classes are actually project oriented classes, I don't do much, um, problems sets or tests or anything.  So I actually work in a shop a lot. 
2:17 2:17 MALE:  Yeah.
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  I make a lot random things.  I...
2:21 2:22 MALE:  Well a lot of your classes tend to be pretty intense it seems like.
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Oh, they're fun though.
2:23 2:27 MALE:  Difficult, oh, absolutely, the megatronics [phonetic] classes, the all those are great.
2:28 2:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, my program, it, I'm actually doing a lot of technical products, mine is more like a, right now I'm focusing on users who ride their bikes, bike commuters who ride in the rain.
2:39 2:39 MALE:  Okay.
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  So I'm designing products that will help them.
2:42 2:47 MALE:  Right on, so you have to do some of the stuff that you, what is it, uh, something PL, the uh...?
2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  PRL?
2:48 2:50 MALE:  Yeah, PRL, yeah the [unintelligible] prototype.
2:49 2:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, yep, my office is right across from there, so.
2:52 2:53 MALE:  Very nice, that's where they make all the cool stuff.
2:54 2:56 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly [laughter] so...
2:55 2:56 MALE:  I'm almost envious of that.
2:57 2:58 FEMALE:  It's a fun program.
2:58 3:06 MALE:  Yeah.  So let's see, uh, how about a little, because you, you are MIT, St Louis, so what was it like coming up in St Louis, I've never been in the area.
3:05 3:22 FEMALE:  Oh, gosh, not much there.  I'm not sure it's, it's not far off from your upbringing I'm sure.  I didn't live on a farm but there wasn't, I don't know.  I guess I really wanted to get out and see the big city, you know.  I mean I lived in the suburb out of St Louis so, just very Midwestern, conservative.
3:22 3:23 MALE:  Kind of relaxed, yeah.
3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, small town.
3:24 3:25 MALE:  Life moves slow.
3:25 3:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, seriously.
3:27 3:28 MALE:  You know [unintelligible] is a pretty good shock.
3:29 3:31 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, very big shock, but I loved it.  I really love it.
3:32 3:40 MALE:  That's good.  [unintelligible] hanging out.  It's so much better when you can enjoy what you're doing.  So what are you, uh, after you get done here what are your aspirations?
3:41 3:46 FEMALE:  Well, I want either publish a book, a comic book on um--
3:46 3:47 MALE: [interposing] Excellent.
3:47 4:05 FEMALE:  Uh, I do a lot of comics.  Or start my own business with some of the products I'm designing.  Or work for a design consulting company.  I've already worked for a lot of large companies like um, that do consumer products and it's just, I don't like work, I don't like implementing someone else's ideas.  I want to do that on my own, so.
4:04 4:06 MALE:  Some of your own, yeah.  Well, very nice.  Well, you're really nice female239.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, you too.
4:07 4:09 MALE:  If you're ever in the [unintelligible] area stop by.
4:09 4:11 FEMALE:  Well, thank you male200.  It's good meeting you.
4:11 4:13 MALE:  Show you [unintelligible] that's up there.
4:12 4:13 FEMALE:  [laughter]
