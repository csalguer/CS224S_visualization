0:01:27.6 0:01:39.2 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  So- well I- I don't have projection skills, so I'm thinking, I'm like oh do you need research or some kind of communications or like writing, I can do that for you, I can do- I'm your person. [laughter]   
0:01:38.7 0:01:41.7 MALE:  Right.  But you don't want to be on TV?  
0:01:39.8 0:01:46.4 FEMALE:  Well, as long as- I've done like a news broadcast, like internships before, it's not that I don't want to, but I think-

0:01:57.6 0:01:59.6 FEMALE:  I think they have a lot of guest stars, so-  
0:02:00.8 0:02:04.0 MALE:  They don't just become famous as they are, uh, Sesame Street-  
0:02:01.3 0:02:04.0 FEMALE:  We'll see, ah, maybe that's a new idea, maybe I'll try that.
