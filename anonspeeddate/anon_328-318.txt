2:03 2:03 MALE:  Uh-huh.
1:57 2:04 FEMALE:  But my Mandarin is terrible, and much to the disappointment of my father.  He spoke fluent Mandarin despite being an American.
2:11 2:11 MALE:  Okay.
2:05 2:05 FEMALE:  So--
2:12 2:16 MALE:  [interposing] So when--but he speaks to you in Mandarin, you would speak English back?

2:37 2:41 FEMALE:  But he--he ended up not being able to meet me for various reasons.
2:48 2:48 MALE:  Okay.
2:42 2:44 FEMALE:  And so I had to get from Beijing down to [unintelligible]--
2:50 2:50 MALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
2:45 2:47 FEMALE:  --uh so that I could then take a bus into Macau.
2:54 2:54 MALE:  Uh-huh.

3:01 3:03 MALE:  [interposing] Were people nice and helpful?
2:56 3:08 FEMALE:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Um people were great.  I had a super time.  Um but it was very useful to be able to say no, no, no.  I don't want a taxi.  Tell me where the bus station is.  I'm a student.  I'm poor.  And at the time I could say that in Mandarin.
3:14 3:16 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Can you say that now?
3:10 3:10 FEMALE:  No.  [laughter].  
3:17 3:17 MALE:  Okay.

3:23 3:25 MALE:  [interposing] You must be--have been entertained by you.
3:21 3:23 FEMALE:  Maybe.  See this was my father's idea of a joke.
3:30 3:30 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  And in French, which he also spoke, he taught me--
3:33 3:33 MALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
3:28 3:32 FEMALE:  --the first thing he taught me how to say was I speak French like a Spanish cow.
3:38 3:38 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:32 3:39 FEMALE:  [Second language].  And then in--in Mandarin [second language].
3:46 3:46 MALE:  [laughter].
3:41 3:42 FEMALE:  Yeah, he thought that was a riot.
