@0:00 0:02 FEMALE: Ah.  Oh my god.
@N/A MALE: [unintelligible]
@0:02 0:03 FEMALE: I know, exactly.  
@N/A MALE: [unintelligible]
(pause) [horn]
0:05 0:05 MALE: Okay.
0:12 0:13 FEMALE: Wow.  Hi.
0:08 0:09 MALE: So, hi, nice meeting you.  nameX.
0:14 0:15 FEMALE: female333. Great to meet you.
0:10 0:13 MALE: female333, oh, it says, uh-- Oh, I see, I thought it said-- 
0:17 0:19 FEMALE: It's contrary intuitive. 
0:14 0:14 MALE: I see.
0:20 0:20 FEMALE: Spelling, but yeah.
0:15 0:16 MALE: Are you uh Spanish or-- ?
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: Croatian.
0:17 0:18 MALE: Croatian, I see.
0:23 0:24 FEMALE: So, hence, an evil spelling.
0:20 0:24 MALE: So did you come after um, the, I guess the Berlin Wall fell right--
0:29 0:29 FEMALE: [laughter]
0:25 0:27 MALE: And I think what I know about Croatia.  You guys have a lot of good basketball players.
0:32 0:32 FEMALE: We do.
0:28 0:28 MALE: Um.
0:34 0:34 FEMALE: We do.
0:29 0:32 MALE: See, I just recently visited the area, I'm not sure if we hit Croatia.
0:37 0:40 FEMALE: I'm, I doubt that you did, actually I was not paying any attention, so I don't know.
0:35 0:37 MALE: I know we went to Latvia, anyway, uh--
0:42 0:43 FEMALE: [laughter]
0:38 0:39 MALE: Let's see, what else do I know about Croatia.
0:44 0:44 FEMALE: Beautiful beaches.  
0:40 0:41 MALE: Yes, that's true.  Uh--
0:46 0:47 FEMALE: Very beautiful beaches.
0:42 0:44 MALE: And you guys also had that like civil war thing.
0:49 0:51 FEMALE: It was beautiful, yeah, yeah.  
0:46 0:47 MALE: Did you come here after that, or-- ?
0:52 0:55 FEMALE: Yeah, so I came here in '99.  So, I was there.
0:50 0:54 MALE: Oh, that was during the height of the- the bombings and whatnot, right, I mean-- 
0:58 1:04 FEMALE: So I mean like the, you know, like I got here in '99, '99, sorry, I don't know what's happening with my-- 
0:58 0:59 MALE: It's alright.  
1:04 1:08 FEMALE: --getting tired.  So '99, height of the war was like '91-'92, so I was there during the time.  
1:03 1:13 MALE: Oh, okay, well I was thinking uh-- Serbo-Croatian, that's what I always heard, there's, was that like, you know, was the uh, remember Clinton in '99 did a, there as the bombing campaign.
1:17 1:19 FEMALE: There was the bombing, but that was mostly in Serbia.
1:14 1:15 MALE: Serbia, okay, I see, I see.
1:20 1:23 FEMALE: Not in Croatia, so we didn't have much to do with it, except being fairly close by.
1:18 1:19 MALE: I see, okay, yeah.
1:24 1:25 FEMALE: Territorial.  Anyway.
1:20 1:22 MALE: Um, so what are you studying?
1:27 1:29 FEMALE: I am an M.D./Ph.D. student, so medicine and-- 
1:24 1:25 MALE: Oh, are you MSTP?
1:30 1:31 FEMALE: Yes, I am. 
1:26 1:27 MALE: Do you know a Sui Chen [phonetic]?
1:33 1:38 FEMALE: Actually, I don't, and the reason for this is I was actually doing only M.D., and then like I just joined the MSTP program recently.
1:33 1:33 MALE: I see.
1:38 1:39 FEMALE: So I don't really know--
1:33 1:34 MALE: He graduated last year from MSTP--
1:40 1:46 FEMALE: Okay, there's no way I would know them, because I didn't really know all that many MSTPs.  I mean, I still don't know all- all that many of them, and-- 
1:40 1:41 MALE: Right, and you definitely woulnd't know--
1:46 1:48 FEMALE: And I definitely, yeah, yeah, so, that sometimes--
1:43 1:46 MALE: So, are you going to be in research or-- ?
1:51 1:58 FEMALE: Probably, although, I mean, honestly, I could make vast sweeping claims about what I'm going to do, but I really don't know, I mean, like six years from now, like--
1:53 1:54 MALE: You're just, you just started, right?  
2:00 2:02 FEMALE: So I, I'm just finishing now my second year as an M.D.
1:58 1:58 MALE: Okay.
2:02 2:06 FEMALE: Second year M.D., and then I'll be doing Ph.D. now, I'm just starting my Ph.D. this summer.  
2:01 2:03 MALE: I see, so in neuroscience, I see.
2:08 2:11 FEMALE: So, and then, it will be over-- I'm sorry?
2:05 2:07 MALE: Who's lab are you thinking?  I- I work in Beckman, so I know some of the people.
2:12 2:18 FEMALE: Okay, yeah I'm um, so I'll be working in [unintelligible] who is in Perrin, so not really.  
2:14 2:15 MALE: Okay, yeah, so-- 
2:19 2:21 FEMALE: It's really more biological sciences.
2:15 2:17 MALE: Yeah, I don't know them as well over there.  It's kind of like--
2:22 2:22 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:18 2:19 MALE: It's too far to walk.  [laughter]
2:25 2:29 FEMALE: Gosh, you know, I'm sure you have to walk [unintelligible] occasionally, and then you pass by, right?  
2:23 2:24 MALE: That's true, that's true.
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: [laughter]
2:25 2:30 MALE: That's true, I should drop by then.  Um, so you, you're based out of Perrin, I mean, that's, you have an office over there?  I mean, I-- 
2:35 2:38 FEMALE: I mean, not-- like at this point I have a bench [laughter]
2:33 2:34 MALE: Okay, well that's good.  
2:39 2:47 FEMALE: So, but I mean, I probably will be there, but I haven't really like, I was doing like um, some stuff there over the summer, and fall, but then like med school was really taking slow, so I'm just really not doing much.
2:42 2:44 MALE: So you're going to be doing neuroscience?
2:49 2:49 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:44 2:45 MALE: So--
2:50 2:52 FEMALE: Molecular, cellular stuff.
2:47 2:52 MALE: In, I mean, so is that like a joint thing where you also do, you know, looking at neurology patients in medicine, and-- ?
2:57 3:10 FEMALE: Not really.  So my Ph.D. will really be much more basic science, and then presumably eventually it will kind of wrap itself in some way that like it ends up being clinically relevant, but the Ph.D. itself will be pretty basic science, so, yeah.  What do you do?  Something in Beckman, obviously.
3:05 3:08 MALE: Uh, well, I mean Beck- Beckman, half in Beckman, and I'm actually moving to [unintelligible]
3:14 3:14 FEMALE: How nice.
3:09 3:12 MALE: Uh, so yeah, I've worked, you know, Seraphim [phonetic] [unintelligible].
3:18 3:18 FEMALE: Sounds familiar, but-- 
3:13 3:16 MALE: Yeah, it's, I do like genomics, basically, so--
3:20 3:21 FEMALE: Okay.  Awesome.
3:16 3:18 MALE: I'm technically in electrical engineering, but-- 
3:23 3:27 FEMALE: Okay.  Oh, you're one of the electrical engineers who kind of sweitched over and does biological stuff.  
3:22 3:23 MALE: Exactly, exactly, right.
3:27 3:28 FEMALE: Cool, that's awesome.
3:23 3:28 MALE: It's not as, not as, you know, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit because biomimetics is, you know, [unintelligible]
3:32 3:39 FEMALE: Exactly.  And if you like can do plenty of stuff, like you're a god, like three people are like, "Oh my god, he can do math, let me [unintelligible]."  
3:35 3:39 MALE: Exactly, right, right, right, exactly, so that's basically, you know, I'm enjoying it, you know, I'm enjoying it while it lasts.
3:44 3:44 FEMALE: That's awesome.  
3:40 3:41 MALE: But uh, so-- 
3:46 3:48 FEMALE: Do you know nameX [phonetic] by any chance?
3:43 3:44 MALE: Yeah, he's in our, was in our group, yeah.
3:48 3:59 FEMALE: Cool, that's awesome, that's funny.  He's a- he's a friend.  So like, he's really good friends with my friend nameX, so like he and nameX went to Duke together, and she and I are good friends in med school, so-- 
3:54 4:01 MALE: Okay, yeah, yeah, nameX, uh, he was in uh, basically my exact group, uh, and he comes to our bio research lab to steal our beer.  [laughter]
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: [laughter]
4:02 4:03 MALE: But he's a good guy, he's a good guy.
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: Yeah, he's a nice guy.  
4:04 4:04 MALE: Um.
4:10 4:12 FEMALE: He can do logarithms in his head, I don't know whether you know this. 
4:11 4:12 MALE: Yes, yeah, well--
4:13 4:15 FEMALE: I'm sure everyone who met him knows this, but-- 
4:15 4:17 MALE: Right, right, uh, he's a, do you know, do you know that whole group of guys like Pat McGrant and uh, Lucy [unintelligible]?
4:23 4:25 FEMALE: I, no, Pat?  
4:20 4:21 MALE: nameX. [horn]
4:27 4:29 FEMALE: I think [horn] I think I met nameX, but I don't know him well.
4:24 4:27 MALE: Okay.  Great, anyway, okay.  Nice to meet you.
4:31 4:31 FEMALE: Nice meeting you.
