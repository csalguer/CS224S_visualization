0:00 0:00 MALE:  Hi.
0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:01 0:02 MALE:  My name's male118.
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  female123.  Nice meeting you too.
0:06 0:09 MALE:  So, uh, what, uh, what discipline are you in?
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  Law.
0:10 0:10 MALE:  Law?
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  How about you?
0:12 0:14 MALE:  I am in the engineering school, the aeronautics and astronautics department.
0:21 0:23 FEMALE:  So you're actually a rocket scientist.
0:17 0:23 MALE:  Well you could say that.  Uh, I guess that's a general term for aerospace engineers, but.
0:30 0:33 FEMALE:  So what kind of stuff do you do?  Do you design rockets or am I completely--
0:27 0:48 MALE:  Uh, there is a course that you can like take, like a series of courses where you actually do design a rocket and fly it out in like the desert somewhere.  But I'm not taking that series of courses.  Uh, there's a whole bunch of disciplines in it, like aerodynamics and dynamics and control.  Uh, rockets in general are just one--
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  Sort of on the fringe?
0:50 0:55 MALE:  Well not necessarily the fringe, just like one area it.  It's not a--it's not all on the rocket science [unintelligible].
1:02 1:04 FEMALE:  So what--a part--what [unintelligible] do you do?
0:59 1:05 MALE:  Uh, well, my major is in dynamics and control, more on like the control side.
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:06 1:23 MALE:  Uh, basically like any system that you have an aircraft, space craft, or whatever, it needs to, uh, basically if you pointed it in a certain direction or perform certain maneuvers or whatever.  And basically, you need some type of control system that will be able to perform that.
1:29 1:39 FEMALE:  But do you find it intimidating to be doing something that just is so important and if you make a mistake, you know, thousands of people could die?  Or does that not really--do you not really think about that?
1:34 1:56 MALE:  Well uh, I have never really thought that, no.  Uh, I don't know.  Just, you just become engrained in the culture of where you are.  Like, I mean, there's hundreds of other engineers doing the same stuff.  And just like, I don't know, this is what we do, just like forget about really what impact is has, or don't even really take time to think about it, I guess.
2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:57 1:59 MALE:  I don't know, is the law school kind of like isolated from everyone else?  Or do you--
2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Oh absolutely.
2:01 2:04 MALE:  Do you have any contact with like anyone outside?
2:10 2:39 FEMALE:  No.  I mean, we are our own little zip code.  We have our own soap opera.  I mean, because, as law schools go, it's fairly small.  Um, I mean, it's nothing as small as the engineering school, I'm sure.  But you know, I mean, we always beat each other all the time.  And we never get out.  I really don't know the entire campus.  Like people will talk about, you know, Cooper Tower or some bell or some church or something on campus, and they like literally only know the law school [laughter] in [unintelligible] and the post office and the book store.  Like that is all that I know.  I feel so isolated from the rest of the campus.
2:33 2:42 MALE:  Yeah.  I think that's true, though, for like all the graduate programs.  I was talking to someone else about it though, too, 'cause I mean, the only places I ever go are like engineering buildings.  
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?
2:43 2:48 MALE:  I only have--I never need to like go to the law school like building or like do anything.
2:54 2:58 FEMALE:  There aren't very many social events either to sort of grab all the graduates together.
2:52 2:52 MALE:  Yeah.  Yes, there aren't, so.
2:59 3:03 FEMALE:  I mean, I take that back.  I know there's been a few, like there was like a Halloween party and stuff like that.  But I mean--
2:57 2:57 MALE:  There was?
3:03 3:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Uh--
2:59 3:00 MALE:  I didn't hear about the Halloween party.
3:06 3:11 FEMALE:  Oh it was like a grad student.  I know there have been a couple, like two or three grad student mixers.  But, um, I haven't gone.
3:05 3:07 MALE:  Yeah.  I know about those.  I went to one of them.
3:13 3:13 FEMALE:  Oh how was it?
3:08 3:13 MALE:  It was all right, you know.  It wasn't that exciting, though.
3:20 3:22 FEMALE:  Um, let me guess.  Engineering is like 80% women? 
3:18 3:18 MALE:  Of course.
3:27 3:35 FEMALE:  That's too bad.  That's too bad [laughter].  So those like five women must always be the [unintelligible].
3:29 3:33 MALE:  Oh I know.  I know. That's the terrible part.  It's like not even worth it anymore.
3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  Really?
3:34 3:34 MALE:  At that point.
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  How many people in your specific program?
3:36 3:40 MALE:  Uh, well like the first year master's program is like--
3:46 3:47 FEMALE:  Are you in the master's program?
3:41 3:41 MALE:  Yeah.
3:48 3:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, how many people are in there?
3:43 3:45 MALE:  Uh, in aero, there's probably like 40.
3:52 3:53 FEMALE:  Oh, that's a lot of students.
3:47 3:50 MALE:  Uh, I don't know.  It's one of the smaller engineering ones.
3:56 3:56 FEMALE:  Is it?
3:51 3:54 MALE:  EE is like 250 or something.
4:00 4:04 FEMALE:  Are you kidding?  [laughter] Wow.  I am really surprised to hear that.
3:58 3:59 MALE:  Really?
4:05 4:05 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:00 4:04 MALE:  Well that's what I heard.  So have to go on that.  All right.  It was nice talking to you.
4:11 4:12 FEMALE:  It was great talking to you.
