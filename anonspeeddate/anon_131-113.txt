0:02 0:10 MALE:  Oh.  I'm impressed.  I mean you just put BS answers.  You're like [unintelligible].  
0:07 0:09 FEMALE:  Well, like so many things that are said it's probably not a caricature.  
0:15 0:17 MALE:  At the end it's just all random for me.  
0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  male113?  
0:18 0:18 MALE:  Yes.  
0:14 0:14 FEMALE:  I'm female131.

0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Do you go by Pat or male113? 
0:23 0:26 MALE:  Uh, either is fine, but Pat's easier.  You know--
0:23 0:25 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I don't know.  Like with guy's names I like the full name better.  
0:30 0:32 MALE:  Oh, really.  It's distinguished.  
0:29 0:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] maybe I like distinguished men.  But I go by female131.  
0:38 0:39 MALE:  Oh, you go by female131?  
0:35 0:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't like Jennifer, and I hate nameX. 
0:42 0:45 MALE:  Oh, really.  But why so particular.  What's the difference?

0:52 0:52 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:49 0:51 FEMALE:  Among friends it makes sense.  
0:55 1:01 MALE:  Okay.  Like I call myself male113 a lot, but then people just end up calling me Pat.  
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  How does it make you feel?  
1:04 1:06 MALE:  I'm fine with it because it's been that way my whole life.

1:10 1:20 MALE:  Yeah, that's what people say.  People always say, yeah, I'm easy going, and I'm good with anything.  And not much bothers me.  That's fine too if they're my friend, you know.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  You're very easy going.  
1:23 1:30 MALE:  So people do do it as a joke, and then [unintelligible] Pat or something.  I've heard that before.  
1:26 1:27 FEMALE:  You've heard it all, huh?
