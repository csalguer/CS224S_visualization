00:27 00:27 MALE: Speed dating?  
00:57 00:57 FEMALE: Yeah.  
00:29 00:30 MALE: It's not shocking to me.  
01:00 01:00 FEMALE: Why?  
00:32 00:36 MALE: Um, because there's many more men than women in the MBA program.  
01:06 01:06 FEMALE: Okay.  
00:37 00:40 MALE: So there's, you know, a lot of single guys.    
01:09 01:09 FEMALE: What year are you?  
00:41 00:42 MALE: I'm in second year.  
01:11 01:13 FEMALE: Okay.  So I know [unintelligible].  
00:45 00:46 MALE: Oh, I know [unintelligible] as well. 
01:14 01:18 FEMALE: Pretty well.  nameX, um, Harvey.  
00:49 00:50 MALE: Uh-huh.  
01:19 01:20 FEMALE: Jacob, Carol [unintelligible].  
00:52 00:54 MALE: Yeah, sure.  How do you know them?  
01:24 01:34 FEMALE: Uh, yeah.  They're, uh, from my program.  Like, Jacob was doing IPER, which is an environmental program that a lot of these people go join to master, [unintelligible], stuff like that.  
01:06 01:07 MALE: So that's what you're doing?  Environmental--
01:37 01:43 FEMALE: Um, yes.  I'm doing something with water resources and water quality in developing countries.  
01:15 01:17 MALE: It's a pretty big deal, I understand.  
01:45 01:47 FEMALE: Yeah.  What about you?  
01:18 01:26 MALE: Isn't that cited as, like, the number one issue facing the world in, like, the next ten years, the quality of water access for the developing world?    
01:56 02:13 FEMALE: Yeah, that's right.  Um, [unintelligible], you know.  It's just with water, but I think there's a lot of, you know, um, it's a trend factor too, that's everybody is talking about water now so it's a good thing to work in water.  But I don't know [unintelligible].  
01:44 01:48 MALE: How do fix the problem?  Is it too expensive or what's--
02:16 02:17 FEMALE: You mean water development?  
01:48 01:52 MALE: You're trying to find cost effective ways to provide clean water?  
02:21 02:54 FEMALE: Well, there are many issues.  There's, um, there's quality, there's not enough supply with water, uh, fresh water, in many countries.  There's quality.  Um, in developing countries especially you don't have a centralized system so piping, given by the government.  So you basically have to, um, go for filters or, you know, household treatment systems that could be quite expensive for, you know, families who earn less than $200 a year.  So that is a big issue.  But what is your training?  Or what is your background?  
02:26 02:33 MALE: Uh, my background is in finance.  But I am looking to do something more entrepreneurial in the next coming years.  
03:02 03:03 FEMALE: What--do you know what?  
02:36 03:00 MALE: Um, I'm working right now on a health and wellness related business to try to help, uh, basic preventive health care.  To try to, um, help people to maintain their health rather then get sick and then try to treat it.  Um, so try getting right now with companies, outfits, with their employees.  Um, so it's interesting.  It's exciting.  And if we can really help people it'd be great.    
03:28 03:29 FEMALE: That's great.  
03:02 03:10 MALE: But it's, you know.  There's a lot people who have tried to do it and just have failed for a number of reasons so we're just trying to figure out exactly what we can do differently.  
03:38 03:39 FEMALE: Well, you have to--do you have a team?    
03:12 03:14 MALE: Yeah.  As a team we've been working on it.    
03:42 03:47 FEMALE: Okay.  That's cool because I, I am one of the organizers for the Social E competitions.  
03:20 03:20 MALE: The what?  
03:48 03:50 FEMALE: For the Social E-Challenge competitions.
03:22 03:23 MALE: Ah, yeah, yeah.

03:26 03:27 MALE: Yeah.  
03:54 04:00 FEMALE: And it was really inspiring to talk to just, you know, each team who are doing very interesting stuff.  
03:32 03:33 MALE: That's really cool.  Wow.  
04:01 04:03 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  It was actually--that's why I'm kind of, like, I don't have a voice today--
03:36 03:36 MALE: Yeah.  
04:04 04:05 FEMALE: Because I was talking all day.
03:37 03:38 MALE: You been talking all day long?
