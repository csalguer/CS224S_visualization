3:08 3:08 FEMALE:  When are you going?
3:10 3:13 MALE:  Most probably August or September for three or four weeks.  Let's see how long.  So, I'm kind of-
3:16 3:17 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I have never been to Japan.
3:20 3:23 MALE:  I haven't been there either.  So, I'm kind of-I'm trying to learn Japanese.  
3:21 3:21 FEMALE:  Really?
3:25 3:25 MALE:  Yeah, yeah. 
3:22 3:24 FEMALE:  Oh, my gosh.  I imagine that's a really hard language.

3:27 3:27 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:31 3:33 MALE:  So, it's like another script to learn and all the characters.
3:30 3:33 FEMALE:  What are the other three?
3:37 3:43 MALE:  English, which is Roman script, and Hindi, which is my mother tongue, and Urdu [phonetic] which is another language.  
3:40 3:44 FEMALE:  I always-I don't know why I always thought Urdu and Hindi were the same script. 
3:47 3:50 MALE:  They don't have the same script.  A lot of the words are the same.  
3:47 3:47 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:51 3:59 MALE:  The grammar is the same.  Their script is like Arabic and Urdu [phonetic].  So, it's drawn like from the left, and the [unintelligible] is the other way.  
3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  It's from right to left and [unintelligible]. 
4:02 4:03 MALE:  The other way, yeah.  
3:58 3:59 FEMALE:  Huh, okay.  
4:05 4:05 MALE:  Like this, yeah. 
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4:06 4:06 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  Like kind.
4:08 4:08 MALE:  Yeah, that's actually it, yeah.  
4:05 4:14 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] Japanese [unintelligible].  I think the reason that I thought that Urdu and Hindi were the same is because Mandarin is actually [unintelligible].  
4:17 4:26 MALE:  Right.  Yeah, Urdu [unintelligible].  Oh, we have to move and then do it. Hey.
