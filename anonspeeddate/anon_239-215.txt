1:40 1:41 MALE:  Oh, wow, okay.
1:41 1:50 FEMALE:  It's very me because I've always loved both art and engineering.  And I'm making, making aesthetically pleasing, utilitarian products for people.
1:50 1:52 MALE:  Okay, okay.
1:52 1:55 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a two year program so I'll be graduating next June, 2006.
1:55 1:57 MALE:  Okay, do you know what you're going to do afterwards?
1:57 2:02 FEMALE:  I don't know, but I swear this whole place is like entrepreneurship, their like really pushing it on us.
2:01 2:02 MALE:  Right.
2:02 2:16 FEMALE:  I never really thought about it very, like, given it much time, but I'm considering it.  Because I've been making all these different things now and dealing with the patent attorney, and just, just learning about the whole process on how to start something, but it's a little, a little daunting, so I'm not sure yet.
2:15 2:16 MALE:  Yeah.
2:18 2:21 FEMALE:  I'm might just stick around like a, a product design consulting firm.
2:21 2:22 MALE:  Okay.
2:22 2:24 FEMALE:  For a little bit and see, see how it is.
2:24 2:27 MALE:  Do you have a nice set of products that you'd like to design or?
2:27 2:48 FEMALE:  Oh, well, I'm more into like sports stuff, or like, um, fun, amusing things.  Like, just, I think, products that make people laugh or smile, like.  I'm not really into like biotech; I don't really want to like make the next stint in the heart.  I'm more like, um, I want to make a stapler that looks like an alligator head because I think it would sell.
2:47 2:48 MALE:  Okay [laughter].
2:50 2:59 FEMALE:  [laughter] okay, maybe not, maybe.  No, okay, maybe not.  I'm also working on like, I was just telling, like wet weather biking gear.  Like focusing on those needs and I'm designing stuff like that.
2:59 3:02 MALE:  Okay.  So where are you from?
3:02 3:04 FEMALE:  Um, St Louis Missouri, in the west.

3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  Uh, went to uh, MIT undergrad.
3:07 3:08 MALE:  Wow.
3:09 3:16 FEMALE:  And um, worked in a couple of industries like uh, Motorola and Apple, just, just different consumer product companies.
3:15 3:21 MALE:  Alright, okay.  Apple's a good one to work for.  I just got myself an Apple laptop so.  
3:18 3:28 FEMALE:  Yeah it was fun, it was very, it's, it's um, and it's different than you think though.  It's not like its fun and like, whew, it's exciting.  It's a lot of pressure.
3:28 3:29 MALE:  Right.
3:29 3:42 FEMALE:  Um, when I was there, I mean, it wasn't like I designed it, it was more like I was doing something with manufacturing.  So, uh, it was like we had these deadlines and then it was like, I don't know.  It was really uh, grueling.  A lot of people work there very, very [unintelligible].
3:42 3:43 MALE:  Right.
3:43 3:45 FEMALE:  But whatever, it was fun, it's a good company.
3:45 3:46 MALE:  Yeah.
3:46 3:55 FEMALE:  I don't know.  But who knows.  I kind of want to work on a more diverse variety of things, maybe, so that's why a consultant company.
3:54 3:57 MALE:  Okay, so maybe entrepreneurship would be a good [unintelligible] then.
3:58 4:04 FEMALE:  Maybe, I don't know.  I just need to uh, meet, I don't know.  I know nothing; I have no idea about business and stuff like that, so.
4:04 4:10 MALE:  Yeah, well. There are courses in, well, entrepreneurship is like [unintelligible], yeah.
