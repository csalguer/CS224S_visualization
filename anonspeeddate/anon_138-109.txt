0:00:45.2 0:00:46.7 FEMALE:  Is that master's or PhD?
0:00:43.0 0:00:45.8 MALE:  Like I'm undecided between master's and PhD actually.
0:00:49.3 0:00:50.3 FEMALE:  Just like me.
0:00:46.6 0:00:49.7 MALE:  Yeah.  So what do you think about Stanford?
0:00:54.9 0:00:55.7 FEMALE:  It's different.
0:00:51.9 0:00:53.0 MALE:  So you came last fall.  
0:00:56.8 0:01:01.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Actually I'm not quite, you know, used to this whole culture thing yet.

0:01:03.7 0:01:04.3 FEMALE:  Where are you from?
0:01:00.9 0:01:03.0 MALE:  Um, before this I was in Indiana. 
0:01:06.9 0:01:07.4 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
0:01:03.6 0:01:04.6 MALE:  How about you?
0:01:08.1 0:01:09.9 FEMALE:  The state or like the college or-
0:01:05.8 0:01:07.6 MALE:  Oh I- I- I went to Purdue.
0:01:11.4 0:01:12.0 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
0:01:07.7 0:01:10.2 MALE:  So, yeah.  What about you?
0:01:14.1 0:01:19.6 FEMALE:  I'm from Berkeley.  I know [unintelligible] [laughter] [unintelligible]  
0:01:14.8 0:01:16.9 MALE:  You know, uh, my brother went to Berkeley as well.  
0:01:21.1 0:01:21.6 FEMALE:  Who?
0:01:16.7 0:01:19.3 MALE:  And Berkeley and Stanford always hate each other but-
0:01:23.0 0:01:23.5 FEMALE:  Oh okay.
0:01:19.3 0:01:24.2 MALE:  -but the fact there's so many Berkeley people go to Stanford and Stanford people go to Berkeley. 
0:01:26.9 0:01:41.9 FEMALE:  Because it's Silicon Valley.  Come on, you know?  Two of my professors from Berkeley came down here [laughter] permanently.  So that's kind of like- I don't know if I've been following them or like just felt like okay, if they're moving this way I'll- I'll just kind of follow them. 
0:01:38.9 0:01:39.8 MALE:  Oh they moved here? 
0:01:44.0 0:01:44.5 FEMALE:  Yes.
0:01:40.8 0:01:41.3 MALE:  To work-
0:01:44.9 0:01:45.9 FEMALE:  Basically like- 
0:01:41.8 0:01:42.9 MALE:  To work in Stanford now?
0:01:47.6 0:01:51.3 FEMALE:  Got hired by Stanford and left to come down here.  So like- 
0:01:46.9 0:01:47.3 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:01:51.8 0:01:52.4 FEMALE:  Huh?
0:01:48.3 0:01:49.3 MALE:  Is it [unintelligible] 
0:01:53.4 0:02:03.1 FEMALE:  Um, that was a CS person, so I-- like the other two is like nameX and nameX and nameX and nameX wrote my recommendation letter.  [laughter]  So I was like, okay, I'll come down here too. 
0:01:58.7 0:01:59.8 MALE:  Oh really so-
0:02:03.5 0:02:04.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:00.2 0:02:02.0 MALE:  Are they like tenured already or are they- 
0:02:05.9 0:02:10.7 FEMALE:  They are tenured because they were tenured up there so like of course they have to get tenure down here otherwise they wouldn't switch, you know.
0:02:06.7 0:02:11.9 MALE:  Oh.  So- so they're not new professors, they are like old time professors, so they just moved to Stanford.
0:02:15.9 0:02:17.2 FEMALE:  Well they were-
0:02:12.9 0:02:14.6 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:02:17.0 0:02:19.7 FEMALE:  -well established professors let's say that. 
0:02:16.8 0:02:20.1 MALE:  But the weather is so much better and the area is so much better right?
0:02:24.4 0:02:24.9 FEMALE:  Than?
0:02:21.2 0:02:21.9 MALE:  Berkeley.
0:02:25.7 0:02:27.5 FEMALE:  Oh Berkeley weather is better.  It was cooler.
0:02:23.3 0:02:23.9 MALE:  Oh really?
0:02:27.3 0:02:30.3 FEMALE:  It was a lot more foggy and cloudy.  I'm into that. 
0:02:26.4 0:02:28.1 MALE:  Oh you're into that? Oh I see.
0:02:31.1 0:02:37.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, this is like desert.  But I mean you're from Purdue, so you're probably like no snow, no nothing, I don't want to see anymore of that, right. 
0:02:33.5 0:02:39.3 MALE:  Yeah, it's a major change.  It's, uh- you know I think the area is a great place. 
0:02:44.0 0:02:46.6 FEMALE:  So what area do you [laughter] study in EE? 
0:02:44.2 0:02:46.7 MALE:  Uh software I would say, systems.
0:02:49.7 0:02:52.4 FEMALE:  Software, so architecture kind of?  
0:02:48.1 0:02:48.5 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:52.3 0:02:52.7 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:49.1 0:02:53.8 MALE:  [unintelligible] such a broad subject- so do you do [unintelligible] 
0:02:57.5 0:02:58.0 FEMALE:  Yeah I did E.
0:02:54.2 0:02:56.4 MALE:  I see.  Almost everybody I know did [unintelligible]  
0:03:00.4 0:03:03.7 FEMALE:  That's the only- I mean there is no EE.  You do [unintelligible] 
0:02:59.5 0:03:00.5 MALE:  Oh, there is no EE? 
0:03:04.0 0:03:09.4 FEMALE:  There is no EE.  You have to do [unintelligible].  It's like MIT where you have to do Core six.  You have to.
0:03:04.6 0:03:16.1 MALE:  Oh, it's like [unintelligible].  Oh interesting.  So, uh, how do you like to spend, uh, most of your time? 
0:03:21.4 0:03:31.5 FEMALE:  Well besides being a workaholic I-- I'm trying to look for like some other things to do.  I've been around here for a while.  So I was born in the Bay area.  I went to Berkeley and I'm now at Stanford.  So I'm trying to like- 
0:03:27.8 0:03:29.3 MALE:  Where were you- where did you grow up? 
0:03:33.7 0:03:34.3 FEMALE:  Fremont. 
0:03:30.4 0:03:33.4 MALE:  Oh, Fremont.  [laughter] I see.  You- you go to Mission or-
0:03:37.6 0:03:41.8 FEMALE:  Yes.  Do you know anyone from Mission? [laughter]  There's a lot of people from Mission. 
0:03:38.1 0:03:42.9 MALE:  Yeah, this- Mission is such a good high school right?  And I- I- live in Fremont. So-
0:03:46.7 0:03:47.7 FEMALE:  Oh really?  Right now? 
0:03:43.3 0:03:51.1 MALE:  So, uh- yeah, so I know Mission has a good school and what else do I know?  Yeah, I think that's all I know.  
0:03:52.2 0:03:52.9 [horn]
0:03:57.5 0:04:02.8 FEMALE:  Okay.  I'm glad to meet you.  I probably won't see you in class because I'm more like the physics device kind of- 
0:03:58.9 0:04:00.7 MALE:  So you're in [unintelligible] something like that.
0:04:05.3 0:04:09.6 FEMALE:  Sort of.  I'm deciding whether to go to optical physics or circuits-
0:04:05.8 0:04:06.4 MALE:  Oh I see.
0:04:10.3 0:04:10.9 FEMALE:  Stuff like that.
0:04:07.8 0:04:10.9 MALE:  It was nice, uh, meeting you.  [unintelligible]
