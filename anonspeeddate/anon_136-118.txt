0:00 0:02 MALE:  Hi, my name is male118.  
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female136.  
0:03 0:04 MALE:  Nice to meet you female136.  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  How is it going?  
0:06 0:07 MALE:  It's going well.  
0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:08 0:09 MALE:  Having fun.  
0:09 0:12 FEMALE:  I don't think I've ever met so many people at one function.  
0:13 0:22 MALE:  Yeah, well I definitely haven't. This like far surpasses any previous number of people.  So, what program are you in?  
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.  
0:24 0:28 MALE:  The law school.  I am in aeronautics and astronautics and the engineering school.  
0:27 0:29 FEMALE: Oh cool, very cool.  
0:29 0:29 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:31 0:34 FEMALE:  I was just telling him I've met so many people from engineering.  
0:35 0:37 MALE:  Yeah.  That's the plan.  
0:38 0:38 FEMALE:  Electrical.  
0:39 0:39 MALE:  Mechanical.  
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  Materials.  
0:41 0:43 MALE:  Oh, materials, that's a good one, yeah.  
0:44 0:46 FEMALE:  And now aeronautics.  
0:46 0:56 MALE:  Yeah, well I have met education, education, education, law school, education, law school, education, law school, etc.  
0:57 1:00 FEMALE:  That's funny.  Well, I think you said, you know, a woman shouldn't be alone in a given--
1:00 1:27 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, that's definitely true.  I've noticed that at least on the engineering side.  I haven't seen that many or talked to that many law school, or business school, or med school, or all of the other schools that like I'm oblivious too because I just walk to the engineering buildings, walk back, and [unintelligible].  Nah. It seems to be like the culture here.  I don't know.  They don't integrate everyone very well.  
1:27 1:33 FEMALE:  I think they're really are very few [unintelligible].  
1:33 1:47 MALE: Yeah, I guess it just seems like everyone is like always too busy.  Like at least that's what people say.  So, like they don't have time to fraternize with the [unintelligible] law school people, or those business school people.  
1:48 1:54 FEMALE:  I mean I think there aren't many ways for that to happen.  
1:55 1:56 MALE:  Yeah, there aren't.  
1:56 2:01 FEMALE:  I mean I don't--I mean most graduate students don't get involved in campus-wide organizations.  
2:01 2:01 MALE:  No.  
2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  And so the--I mean at least knowing myself and my friends, all of us are involved in getting the [unintelligible].  
2:06 2:06 MALE: Yeah.  
2:07 2:11 FEMALE: Do you live on campus?  
2:11 2:15 MALE:  Yeah, I live in Croman [phonetic] actually, Caruthers Memorial.  
2:13 2:18 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's [unintelligible].  
2:18 2:22 MALE:  Yeah, it's convenient for me because it's right on campus.  So, I just like walk everywhere.  
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:23 2:24 MALE:  I'm not used to this bike culture.  
2:25 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:25 2:43 MALE:  It kind of freaked me out when I'm walking and almost like die.  I don't know.  My undergrad school, Perdue in Indiana, was like thirty some thousand people.  So, there was no room for bikes on that campus.  It was all walking, and I like that a lot better.  
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  And cool.  
2:45 2:53 MALE:  Yeah, well there in the winter it's pretty cold.  But yeah I guess people don't want to ride their bikes in the cold weather.  
2:54 2:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I was wondering what kind of work are you doing in aeronautics?  
3:00 3:14 MALE:  I don't know.  I'm not doing so much work per se I'm doing just like courses and stuff.  I'm not doing like research or anything so I've got the standard homework steps and exams and stuff.  
3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Do you like it though?  
3:18 3:22 MALE:  I like it as much as you can like doing problems I guess.  
3:23 3:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, but there's a lot of--maybe like [unintelligible] and stuff?  
3:28 3:34 MALE:  I don't think so.  You'd have to search far and wide to find someone who likes doing problem [unintelligible].  
3:34 3:36 FEMALE:  Well, are you happy with your choice?  
3:37 3:48 MALE:  Yeah, I mean I'm really good at it, and I have more fun doing it than I probably would a lot of other things just because.  
3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  So, relatively.  
3:50 4:01 MALE:  Relatively it's all right.  I'll probably like what I do for a living a lot more than actual schooling.   So, we'll see how that goes.  Ah, [unintelligible] twice in a row.  
4:02 4:03 FEMALE: It was nice to meet you.
4:03 4:04 MALE:  Yeah, it was nice talking to you.
