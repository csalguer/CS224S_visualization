0:01 0:07 MALE: Trying to remember what I put in here.  Okay, who are we-- I don't even remember at this point who everybody was.
0:01 0:04 FEMALE: I know, I don't know how I'm going to remember after this, like who was who and like--
0:12 0:18 MALE: Yeah.  Well, there's this blank sheet, so I just stole it from the copy and I'm taking notes on it to keep.  [horn] I don't think we get to keep this, will we?
0:11 0:13 FEMALE: No, I don't think so, that's really useful.  [laughter]
0:20 0:22 MALE: Yeah, anyway I'm male313.
0:15 0:15 FEMALE: female332.
0:23 0:24 MALE: Nice to meet you.  How are things going?  
0:18 0:22 FEMALE: Good, I really should've thought of the- the keeping notes thing; otherwise, I'm going to have no idea.  But--
0:29 0:34 MALE: Yeah, it's going to be, I mean, even if you like, okay you get a match, it's like, okay, who was nameX?  I have no idea.  
0:27 0:27 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:34 0:35 MALE: Or whatever, you know.
0:28 0:28 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:36 0:38 MALE: And then how do you ask them out?  I have no idea what they look like.
0:32 0:36 FEMALE: I know, it's like, um, we talked about some stuff, but I don 't remember.  
0:43 0:44 MALE: And send me a picture, because I have no idea who you are.
0:38 0:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  
0:45 0:45 MALE: Yeah.
0:38 0:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  
0:46 0:47 MALE: I don't know.  So what are you studying?
0:41 0:42 FEMALE: I study biology, plant biology.  
0:50 0:51 MALE: Great. I'm CS.  
0:44 0:44 FEMALE: Okay.
0:52 0:53 MALE: Ph.D.  Is that you too?
0:46 0:47 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, Ph.D.
0:54 0:55 MALE: Excellent.  What year are you?
0:49 0:49 FEMALE: Second.
0:57 0:57 MALE: Third, so--
0:50 0:51 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
0:58 1:03 MALE: I don't know, hope to graduate in maybe three more.  How long is your program typically?
0:56 0:59 FEMALE: Like five or six years.  Yeah, about the same.  
1:06 1:09 MALE: You guys have a decen t number of guys and girls.  
1:02 1:06 FEMALE: Well, it's a more or less an even split. I don't know exactly what the numbers are.  
1:12 1:16 MALE: I'm so jealous, 'cause CS is like, I don't know if you've seen the CS t-shirt for this year.
1:10 1:10 FEMALE: No.
1:17 1:19 MALE: It's like five male symbols and one female symbol.
1:13 1:13 FEMALE: [laughter]
1:21 1:22 MALE: Says Stanford CS 2000 [unintelligible]
1:16 1:24 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  So, actually it was funny the- the class that I entered with, I was the only woman.  Um, but that's- 
1:31 1:31 MALE:  Oh, wow.
1:24 1:26 FEMALE: That's very unusual, in my department.  
1:32 1:32 MALE: That sounds unusual.
1:27 1:29 FEMALE: But I mean, I think it was just sort of a fluke.
1:36 1:37 MALE: How big was that class?
1:30 1:31 FEMALE: There's only 17, so--
1:39 1:41 MALE: So that's within sort of statistical [unintelligible]
1:34 1:36 FEMALE: Yeah, I mean, statistics of small populations, you know.
1:43 1:46 MALE: Yeah, we have 40, I think, in our year.
1:39 1:39 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
1:47 1:48 MALE: And they're do fine, you know.
1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:49 1:49 MALE: They're whatever.
1:42 1:42 FEMALE: Yeah.  
1:50 1:51 MALE: So here I am.
1:43 1:45 FEMALE: And it sounds like you're a little bit ahead of EE, though.  
1:53 2:04 MALE: I think so, yeah, and my friends in Mech E say, "Oh, you know, there are no girls, because you have to lift these heavy things in the shop," And I'm like, "Wow, is that really true?"  [laughter]  You really have to lift heavy tools?  I have no idea, maybe it is.  
1:58 2:00 FEMALE: I don't know, I have to lift heavy things, but [laughter]
2:08 2:08 MALE: What are you working on?
2:02 2:05 FEMALE: Uh, I work on the response of plants to global change, global environmental change.
2:12 2:16 MALE: Okay.  So you like looking at stuff out in the hills.  Or how does that work?
2:08 2:18 FEMALE: Yeah, I- I work up at Jasper Ridge, just- just west of here.  
2:19 2:21 MALE: Cool.  So how do plants respond to global change?
2:15 2:39 FEMALE: Well, everyone always thought that they would get bigger, because if there's more CO2 in the atomosphere, they can grow more flowers, right?  Um, but it- it is looking more and more like that's not necessarily the case, that having more carbon and various other, you know, environmental changes, make it so they don't, aren't necessarily as happy in other ways, and so they don't- they don't add as much carbon.  So.  Yeah.
2:47 2:52 MALE: Very cool.  So what, do you think you'll be a professor, or what do you see yourself doing after this?
2:45 2:50 FEMALE: Probably a professor.  I mean, it's a little up in the air at this point.  Yeah.  What about you?
2:57 2:58 MALE: I'm actually thinking industry.  I don't know.
2:51 2:51 FEMALE: Oh, yeah.
2:59 3:01 MALE: I worked in industry for a year at undergrad, and it was really awesome.
2:53 2:55 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  Who did you work for?  
3:02 3:13 MALE: Uh, AMD, in Austin, Texas, it's like a [unintelligible].  You know, they did microprocessors and I was in verification there.  Everybody had a Ph.D. in my group, so I feel like I need the Ph.D.  But I think I want to end up doing this job--
3:06 3:06 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  
3:14 3:16 MALE: --somewhere.  I don't know.
3:09 3:10 FEMALE: Not around here?  Or uh--
3:17 3:20 MALE: Well, probably not; well maybe.  I mean, it's still [unintelligible]
3:13 3:15 FEMALE: Even though it's kind of the hot spot for computers?
3:22 3:27 MALE: Yeah, but what- what I do in particular is, in Austin, and actually the this place in Iowa that's very good.  
3:20 3:20 FEMALE: Really?
3:28 3:29 MALE: Yeah, Iowa, like what the hell?
3:22 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
3:30 3:34 MALE: Cedar Rapids, Iowa, it's one of the centers of this stuff.  I actually spent last summer there.
3:26 3:28 FEMALE: And what is it that you do?
3:35 3:38 MALE: Uh, verification, proving correctness in programs and hardware.
3:32 3:32 FEMALE: Okay.  
3:39 3:46 MALE: And sort of mathematically analyzing all possible behaviors, instead of just, "Well, this is how [unintelligible] that we got time to test, and it works on those," so that's not good.
3:39 3:40 FEMALE: I see.  I see.
3:49 3:51 MALE: It's pretty cool, yeah.  I don't know, you having fun tonight?  
3:45 3:48 FEMALE: Yeah, it's fun, it's a lot of people, but--
3:55 3:58 MALE: It's a lot of people, although I guess maybe it would've been more, I think she had trouble getting women.
3:52 3:54 FEMALE: Yeah, I think she had trouble getting enough people, but this is a lot.  
4:02 4:03 MALE: I have actually friends with [unintelligible] and--
3:56 3:56 FEMALE: Oh, uh-huh.
4:03 4:11 MALE: --try and help her get, you know, more women emailing people I know and I think maybe a couple of people are here because I sent them emails.  
4:05 4:05 FEMALE: Cool.  
4:13 4:23 MALE: I don't know.  It's kind of- it's kind of awkward, though, with some of these- some of these dates.  I don't know.  I just kind of feel like, "Wow, I'm not clicking with this person at all," but you want to keep trying.
4:16 4:19 FEMALE: Well, I mean, it's you know, four minutes or whatever it is.  
4:26 4:31 MALE: Yeah, well that's- that's the upside, you know, there's an upper bound on how much awkward silence you can have with someobdy.  
4:25 4:27 FEMALE: You might want to look at it as an upside, yeah.  [horn]  But--
4:35 4:37 MALE: Anyway.  Alright, good luck, good to meet you.
4:30 4:31 FEMALE: Yeah, good to meet you.
4:39 4:42 MALE: Take it easy.  Oh, geez.
