00:01  00:14	MALE:  [horn] [unintelligible] [laughter].  Normally.  Ah, um.  So, what is your name [unintelligible]?  Is it a usual name?  No.  I never heard of it.

00:16  00:16	MALE:  Oh, it's Hebrew.  
00:16  00:19	FEMALE:  Yeah, so yeah [laughter].
00:20  00:23	MALE:  That's okay.  So your parents are Jewish and everything.  I mean you are?  Yeah.   And, but you're American.  You're --
00:24  00:26	FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm not Israeli.
00:27  00:29	MALE:  You have a good -- you have a good accent, yeah.  So.  It looks like you are American.
00:30  00:34	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm born and bred [laughter].
00:35  00:35	MALE:  Where were you born?
00:36  00:36	FEMALE:  D.C.
00:37  00:37	MALE:  Oh, okay.
00:38  00:39	FEMALE:  So, the other side of the country.
00:39  00:39	MALE:  The other side.
00:40  00:42	FEMALE:  Well, I'm going to say it's that way, although essentially I'm facing south and that would make that about --.
00:43  00:44	MALE:  So which side is the best?
00:45  00:45	FEMALE:  Which side is the best? 
00:46  00:46	MALE:  Yeah.
00:47  00:49	FEMALE:  Um, I don't know.
00:50  00:51	MALE:  If you like to choose.  
00:51  00:52	FEMALE:  Yeah. I don't know.  I like the West coast. 
00:52  00:53	MALE:  I mean you going to go back?
00:53  01:06	FEMALE:  I don't know.  I don't know if I'll go back.  I don't -- on the East coast I'm more of a Northeastern person.  So I went to school in Massachusetts and like New England.  I'm good -- I can go with New England.  The rest of the Mid Atlantic South, not really my thing.
01:07  01:07	MALE:  New England is north?
01:08  01:08	FEMALE:  Yeah.  
01:08  01:09	MALE:  North from New York?
01:09  01:11	FEMALE:  So like Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire.
01:12  01:12	MALE:  I couldn't go there.
01:13  01:14	FEMALE:  Too cold?
01:15  01:19	MALE:  No.  Too cold, exactly.  [unintelligible], I don't know.  [unintelligible] or anywhere.  I don't know.
01:20  01:22	FEMALE:  That's why you came to California?
01:22  01:23	MALE:  Yeah.
01:23  01:24	FEMALE:  [laughter].
01:24  01:25	MALE:  I try to fly to [unintelligible], but it was really like last chance.  But otherwise San Diego.
01:32  01:36	FEMALE:  [laughter] you were looking at the weather for each school before you sent in an application?
01:37  01:40	MALE:  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah, why not.
01:41  01:42	FEMALE:  That's a reasonable thing to consider.
01:43  01:47	MALE:  Yeah, I didn't how it was going to be, so I just choose the only thing I knew before.  So, yeah.
01:48  01:49	FEMALE:  So that was California?
01:49  01:59	MALE:  California did you say?  Yeah.  It's good yeah, yeah.  I don't think I'm going to leave here.  I don't know, it's America.  I like my country.  
02:00  02:00	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:01  02:02	MALE:  But maybe, maybe.
02:02  02:03	FEMALE:  Maybe.
02:04  02:12	MALE:  No, I like it.  I mean, I like San Francisco, going out.  But maybe not for my -- for one year is good but I get bored I think, you know.
02:13  02:14	FEMALE:  Okay.  Where are you from?
02:15  02:16	MALE:  From the South of France.
02:17  02:18	FEMALE:  Where?
02:19  02:20	MALE:  [unintelligible].  You know that?
02:20  02:21	FEMALE:  I know where it is [laughter].
02:21  02:23	MALE:  You know where it is.  Good.  How come you know this?
02:24  02:26	FEMALE:  I took French for a while [laughter].
02:27  02:28	MALE:  You went to France as well?
02:29  02:30	FEMALE:  In high school.  My French is terrible.  I have the worst accent ever.  So --
02:31  02:32	MALE:  Oh, don't try it please.
02:33  02:33	FEMALE:  I won't [laughter].
02:34  02:41	MALE:  Because, people are like, oh I took French for two years.  And they start speaking and so I have to smile and look and nod, but I don't understand.
02:42  03:18	FEMALE:  That's fine.  A friend of mine, her dad is like terrible with languages.  But her parents travel a lot.  Her mom is very good.  Her mom knows four or five different languages.  But her dad has learned this nonsense line in like 18 different languages.  It's something about the green horse crossing the street.  Something that like -- the point being that someone -- if someone tries to speak to him in whatever language he's going to he says this nonsense line and they clearly understand that he like has no idea what he is saying.  And so rather than having to like pretend in a really poor accent that he is like -- I speak just a little bit or whatever.  He has this nonsense line that he pulls out and it works wonders, you know.
03:18  03:19	MALE:  And you don't.  You could.
03:20  03:28	FEMALE:  I could create my own nonsense line.  I haven't done it yet.  But I'll work on the blue cat jumping over fences or something [laughter].
03:29  03:30	MALE:  Don't, don't.  Do you speak Hebrew?
03:31  03:32	FEMALE:  I do speak Hebrew.
03:34  03:36	MALE:  Oh really.  Is it hard?  Are you taking Hebrew classes?
03:37  04:03	FEMALE:  Not taking it here.  It's a language that I think that's um hard when you first start.  I mean it's a whole different alphabet and a different group structure.  But once you understand -- once you understand the mechanics of it, it's actually a very easy language in the sense that like there's um, every -- basically there are three roots -- three letter roots for every word.  And the three letter root will apply [horn] to like the noun and the verb.  You know, so once you know the structure.  
04:04  04:04	MALE:  It's tricky.
04:05  04:08	FEMALE:  Yeah, it's tricky to figure it out, but you have, like, an epiphany and you realize oh, that's how it works.
04:09  04:10	MALE:  I would like to learn Hebrew in four minutes, but I think --.
04:11  04:12	FEMALE:  That's all right.
04:13  04:15	MALE:  Thank you very much. Have fun.  Good-bye.
