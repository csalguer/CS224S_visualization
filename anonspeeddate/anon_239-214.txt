2:15 2:16 MALE:  Yes, I like it.
2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  When was that?
2:16 2:19 MALE:  Couple designs went out to market.  It was nice, it was right after school.
2:20 2:21 FEMALE:  Where, I mean where are they located?
2:21 2:22 MALE:  Cincinnati
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Oh, over at Proctor and Gamble?
2:23 2:24 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
2:24 2:27 FEMALE:  That's interesting, you worked for Crest for a couple of years and then, and then you started this?
2:27 2:29 MALE:  Yeah, and then after that I worked for Always [laughter].
2:29 2:31 FEMALE:  [laughter] no, really [laughter]?
2:30 2:39 MALE:  Yeah, I did.  I didn't, I didn't design the product, for some, you know, I don't know why not, like discrimination I guess.  But I, I worked on the machines.  I helped, um, improve the machines.
2:39 2:46 FEMALE:  That's so interesting. [laughter] so, did you leave because you didn't like what you were doing or because you wanted to get, you wanted to do some--
2:46 2:51 MALE:  I left because I wanted to get away from the city and I wanted to do aerospace.  And I, I wanted a new start.
2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.
2:52 2:53 MALE:  So I came here, and I liked it.
2:53 3:08 FEMALE:  Nice, I've worked in a couple consumer product industries like, um, like my coop at Apple and the, I just came from Motorola for about a, a little over a year after I graduated.  So I like consumer products.  In fact, then I wanted to do, I want to do my own thing.
3:08 3:09 MALE:  Right.
3:09 3:17 FEMALE:  And that's why I went to this, back to the program because, it's like I was, you know, implementing somebody else's ideas when I want to do my own, so.
3:16 3:19 MALE:  Yeah, I understand.  What do you want to do afterwards?  Do you know or is it?
3:18 3:20 FEMALE:  Good question, I have no idea.  I...
3:20 3:22 MALE:  Well, and I mean I like the fact that you said you want to implement your own ideas.
3:23 3:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, you know, it's like, they really push, I don't know if you feel it too.  But they push the entrepreneurship thing on, on you.
3:27 3:28 MALE:  Yeah.
3:28 3:36 FEMALE:  May, maybe not, but my classes are all like, take your idea to market, dah [phonetic], dah, dah, dah, dah .  They had like a patent attorney and like, go get your ideas protected.
3:36 3:37 MALE: Which class is that, that taught you how to do that?
3:37 3:55 FEMALE:  Oh, it's great, um, it's called implementation.  I'm in there right now.  I, I highly recommend it.  It's 216B, uh, it brings you through the whole process because they bring in like patent lawyers and like, like competitive analysis.  And uh, they have like a trade show.  It's really, it's a good class. Um.
3:55 3:56 MALE:  Okay, thanks, female239.
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, no problem.
