0:04 0:07 FEMALE:  [crosstalk]  
0:08 0:13 MALE:  I've actually not tried them yet.  I'm saving them.  All right.  
0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  They're good.  
0:14 0:15 MALE:  Well, I know I had them way back when. 
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  Where are you from?
0:17 0:20 MALE:  I am from outside of Chicago in Illinois.  
0:20 0:22 FEMALE:  I was going to guess somewhere around there.  
0:23 0:24 MALE:  How would you know that?  
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  The accent.  
0:25 0:28 MALE:  No, midwesterners don't have an accent.  
0:27 0:31 FEMALE:  Yes, you totally do.  You say accent [unintelligible].  
0:32 0:32 MALE:  What?  
0:32 0:34 FEMALE:  You look stunned.  [unintelligible] have heard this before.  
0:35 0:40 MALE:  No, I've heard that midwesterners don't have an accent, and everyone else does.  
0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] don't have accents.  
0:45 0:48 MALE:  Then how come all of like TV personalities all talk like this?
0:47 0:51 FEMALE:  See personalities, you're "A", midwestern "A," Chicago.  
0:52 0:55 MALE:  Then how come all the TV persons think--
0:53 0:56 FEMALE:  [interposing]  It's not a bad thing.  I have an accent too.  
0:57 0:59 MALE:  Yeah, well southern accents are clear.  
0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Clear?  
1:01 1:02 MALE:  Clear that it's an accent.  
1:01 1:05 FEMALE:  Oh, obvious.  Like, the words aren't clear.  
1:06 1:07 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:06 1:07 FEMALE: Like nobody has ever told me that before.  
1:08 1:09 MALE: Yeah.  
1:10 1:12 FEMALE: Excellent.  So you came out here for grad school?
1:14 1:15 MALE: Yes, that is correct.  
1:14 1:14 FEMALE: In?  
1:16 1:18 MALE: Aeronautics and astronautics.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE: Aeronautics, interesting.  
1:19 1:19 MALE: Yeah.  
1:19 1:19 FEMALE: Interesting. 
1:21 1:22 MALE: Haven't heard that one before?  
1:21 1:23 FEMALE: [unintelligible]?  
1:24 1:26 MALE: Well, I prefer astronautics because--
1:25 1:26 FEMALE: [interposing] What's the difference?  
1:27 1:32 MALE:  Well, aeronautics is like aircraft and like objects that are flying through the atmosphere.  
1:31 1:31 FEMALE: Okay.  
1:32 1:36 MALE: And astronautics is like spacecraft and objects that are in space.  
1:36 1:37 FEMALE: You're intersted in space stuff?  
1:38 1:40 MALE: Yeah because space is so much cool.  
1:40 1:40 FEMALE: True.  
1:42 1:45 MALE: Yeah, a lot cooler than airplanes, which have been around for--
1:44 1:45 FEMALE: [interposing] Yeah, I'm with you on that.  
1:46 1:49 MALE: Man, they're so old.  They haven't changed in like 50 years.  
1:48 1:50 FEMALE: But spacecraft does all the time?
1:51 1:52 MALE: Well, not really.  
1:51 1:53 FEMALE: Is there any money for spacecraft?
1:54 1:57 MALE: That's kind of the problem because it costs too much.  
1:57 1:57 FEMALE: Yeah.  
1:58 2:00 MALE: So then it's all like government work mostly.  
2:00 2:03 FEMALE: Right, isn't the government like not shelling out the big bucks.  
2:04 2:13 MALE: Well, they aren't, but they have a huge amount that's just like yearly that they give to NASA and other places, but--
2:12 2:16 FEMALE: [interposing] So, do you aspire to work for NASA?  
2:19 2:20 MALE: Not particularly.  
2:19 2:20 FEMALE: You could have [unintelligible] said watch out.  
2:21 2:25 MALE: Oh yeah, see where all the problems come down from the spacecraft.  
2:25 2:27 FEMALE: It's a pretty neat place, actually.  
2:28 2:33 MALE: Oh, I'm sure.  Texas has a bunch of major cities, and I'm sure there's a lot of cool stuff going on.  
2:32 2:34 FEMALE: And in fact [unintelligible] the largest of them.  
2:35 2:37 MALE: The largest of the Texas cities?  
2:37 2:38 FEMALE: The fourth largest city in the country.  
2:39 2:40 MALE: Interesting.  
2:39 2:40 FEMALE: We're not proud at all.  
2:41 2:45 MALE: Chicago is the third though.  So, I got you beat on that one.  
2:45 2:46 FEMALE: Are you from Chicago?  
2:47 2:50 MALE: Well, outside of Chicago.  
2:49 2:51 FEMALE: I got you.  You're in the burbs.  
2:53 2:57 MALE:  The northwest ones, yeah. Are you familiar with the suburbs of Chicago?  
2:56 3:01 FEMALE:  I know some of them.  I'm an ed student.  We learn the Chicago suburbs, you know.  
3:03 3:06 MALE: Because the education is so terrible in the city of Chicago?  
3:05 3:11 FEMALE: No.  Well, because there's a huge difference between people in Chicago and the schools [unintelligible].  
3:12 3:12 MALE: Oh yeah.  
3:11 3:12 FEMALE: The suburbs have some great schools.  
3:13 3:20 MALE: Oh yeah, the ones that I went to are fantastic, but the inner city is probably a much different story.  
3:21 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:24 3:26 MALE: So you are in education then?  
3:25 3:25 FEMALE: I am.
3:26 3:29 MALE: I've heard a lot of people say are in education.  
3:28 3:29 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  
3:30 3:33 MALE: It seems to be over represented, or maybe accurately represented.  
3:32 3:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] ed people.  
3:35 3:37 MALE: Ah, so it's the anti-engineering arm?  
3:37 3:41 FEMALE:  Yes, we balance all the engineers and [unintelligible].  
3:42 3:43 MALE:  It's a good thing.  We need to be--
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I've heard there are a lot of CS women in here too.  
3:44 3:46 MALE: Oh, I have not heard of one yet.  
3:45 3:45 FEMALE: Really?  
3:47 3:50 MALE: Maybe they're backloaded over there, so [unintelligible] cut them off.  
3:49 3:51 FEMALE: I don't know because everyone is moving in the same direction.  So, I thought they were--
3:52 3:55 MALE: [interposing]  Oh, they already told--people already told you this?  
3:54 3:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:56 3:58 MALE: Ah, maybe I just didn't ask the right questions.  
3:57 4:02 FEMALE: Go back to the beginning and start over.  Your dates 11 through 20 are [unintelligible].  
4:03 4:05 MALE: Ah, missing out.  
4:04 4:04 FEMALE: Are you enjoying this?  
4:06 4:07 MALE: Oh yeah, it's fun.  
4:06 4:06 FEMALE: Yeah?  
4:07 4:10 MALE: I've never done anything like this before so I'm having a good time.  
4:09 4:12 FEMALE: Good.  Enjoy.  It was nice to meet you.  Enjoy your teddy grahams.  
4:13 4:17 MALE: Oh yeah.  I will.  That first one got me geared up for some more.  
4:16 4:17 FEMALE:  You can have more on your way out.  
4:18 4:20 MALE:  I have my own whole pack.
