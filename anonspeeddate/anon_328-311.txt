0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  Station H.
0:13 0:17 MALE:  Oh, you're H.  I'd--I--you know, I haven't done the station.  There's no other female328's here so far.
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  And it should be alphabetical I'm told.
0:20 0:25 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Well that makes sense.  I could probably work--work back.  Okay.  So--
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  [interposing] Provided you're sober.  I--I--that's--
0:27 0:27 MALE:  [interposing] Yes.
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  --I hear that's one of the standard strip sobriety tests.
0:29 0:35 MALE:  Yes.  I--I am, trust me.  I couldn't have gotten him here.  Well, hypothetically.  So--so what are you studying here?
0:36 0:36 FEMALE:  I'm getting my MBA--
0:37 0:37 MALE:  [interposing] Oh, you are.  Okay.  
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  --over at the business school.
0:39 0:39 MALE:  I've done that.
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  Really.
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Now I'm on my EE degree.
0:42 0:42 FEMALE:  That's awesome.
0:42 0:44 MALE:  I did.  I got--I got an MBA.  I was--so what year are you?
0:44 0:44 FEMALE:  Second year.
0:45 0:45 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:45 0:47 FEMALE:  But going to stick around the Bay Area.  I decided I liked it.
0:48 0:48 MALE:  Really?
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:48 0:49 MALE:  What do you--what do you think about doing?
0:50 0:54 FEMALE:  Well over the summer, I'll probably keep working with this um startup that I'm helping out right now.
0:54 0:54 MALE:  Okay.
0:55 1:01 FEMALE:  Um then in--then come the fall, I promised to go back to the--to this management consulting firm that's paying--that's footing the bill, so.
1:01 1:02 MALE:  Which one?
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  Uh Boston Consulting Group.
1:04 1:05 MALE:  Okay, BCG.  Okay.
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:05 1:07 MALE:  It's not like I don't--I haven't heard all of them, so.
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  So were you here for your--for your MBA as well?
1:09 1:09 MALE:  Yes.
1:10 1:10 FEMALE:  Double dipping.
1:11 1:12 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  It is so nice around here.
1:13 1:15 MALE:  Yeah, no.  Yeah, so I did my MBA.
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:15 1:18 MALE:  And then I did like completely the opposite of any--any like reasonable person did.  
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:19 1:21 MALE:  I went to--I did uh MBA.  I'm doing EE now..
1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  So why?
1:22 1:22 MALE:  Why?
1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:23 1:24 MALE:  'Cause I'm--I'm always really fascinated--
1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
1:24 1:32 MALE:  --in engineering and you know.  I don't know.  I didn't really sort of feel like I had the opportunity to do that as an undergrad for a variety of reasons.  But--
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
1:33 1:39 MALE:  And so--and plus the program here is totally phenomenal.  So I actually work part time in a duty-free [phonetic] part time.
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:40 1:42 MALE:  I--actually I probably work full time and do EE degree, so.
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:43 1:48 MALE:  So it's a--and like everyone in--all my classmates think that I'm just insane.  It's like what do they mean--
1:49 1:49 FEMALE:  [interposing] Are you the [unintelligible]?
1:50 1:55 MALE:  Yeah, probably.  A little bit.  So--but uh it seems totally hard, too.  It's like compared to the MBA program.
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:56 2:01 MALE:  The MBA program was like whatever.  Studied like ten minutes before a test and uh--
2:01 2:03 FEMALE:  [interposing] It depends if you're working with a startup or not at the same time.
2:04 2:05 MALE:  Oh, okay.  That's true.
2:05 2:06 FEMALE:  I still haven't learned to play golf.
2:07 2:07 MALE:  Really?
2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, very bad.
2:08 2:09 MALE:  Wow.  I think though--
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh well.
2:10 2:12 MALE:  I think the thing though is the lower you score, you guys maybe would--no.
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Oh well.
2:15 2:18 MALE:  So--so you're going to work with the startup afterwards for a little bit?
2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:18 2:19 MALE:  But what--what does the startup do?
2:20 2:21 FEMALE:  Uh consumer robotics.
2:22 2:22 MALE:  Really?
2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:23 2:25 MALE:  Wow.  Do you have any robotics background or engineering background?
2:26 2:32 FEMALE:  Uh that's not my background.  I'm--I am the strategy and communications and, to some extent, I seemed to have become the recruiting person.
2:33 2:33 MALE:  Really?
2:33 2:35 FEMALE:  Heaven forbid.
2:35 2:40 MALE:  So you're like let me put you in my tickler files.  You know a recruiter actually said that to me once?
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  In her what file?
2:42 2:45 MALE:  Tickler file.  Isn't that just creepier than hell?  I shouldn't say that.
2:44 2:44 FEMALE:  That just seems--
2:45 2:50 MALE:  [interposing] It's during this like formative thing.  You're like he told me about a tickler file.  That's really perverse.  The--
2:50 2:53 FEMALE:  [interposing] [laughter].  There--no, no.  But there isn't a perverse scale.
2:53 2:53 MALE:  That's true.
2:54 3:03 FEMALE:  See.  There should be a perverted scale and then also how--like there should be both sign at like extent and how good or bad it is.
3:03 3:17 MALE:  I agree.  No, I think it's right.  Well, the thing is, interestingly in here, is that, you know, we could be like going your friendly.  I was like--I was like flirtatious and then just 'cause you're like thinking these are all like positive things you'd be like, you know [unintelligible] awkward.
3:17 3:18 FEMALE:  [laughter].
3:17 3:21 MALE:  And you just aren't really--I bet you'll like see--this is a badly designed survey.
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  [laughter].
3:23 3:28 MALE:  I need to write that.  But uh so you--so you must be like totally excited.  You're going to be done.
3:29 3:34 FEMALE:  Well, it--I've enjoyed the last two years.  So I'm not sure excited is quite the way I'd characterize it.
3:34 3:36 MALE:  Well, that sort of sucks that you can't take afternoon naps anymore.
3:37 3:39 FEMALE:  It's not that relaxed.
3:39 3:43 MALE:  I'm sorry.  That's the whole reason why I went to business school.  The afternoon naps.
3:44 3:46 FEMALE:  You were in one of the slacker classes.  You're like the current class--
3:47 3:47 MALE:  [interposing] No, no, no.  
3:47 3:47 FEMALE:  Slacker.
3:47 3:53 MALE:  No, actually yeah, yeah.  No.  I was doing--it was pretty--I don't think I--see, I actually went out with the philosophy of not like working my tail off--
3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  [interposing] Uh-huh.
3:54 3:57 MALE:  --which is sort of weird 'cause, you know, the engineering degree is like that's all you do.
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:58 4:01 MALE:  It's so uh--but I was like there's so many awesome people here--
4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
4:02 4:04 MALE:  --that I'm meeting in this program, especially the foreigners.
4:05 4:05 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
4:05 4:12 MALE:  Like when--the first year I started like I--I came to [unintelligible] a week early so I could meet all the foreigners and somebody like local guy, right.
4:12 4:12 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
4:13 4:16 MALE:  And now I have like all these vacation destinations.  Anywhere like I want, I can stay with someone.  
4:16 4:16 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Very sensible.
4:17 4:17 MALE:  It's very cool.
4:17 4:17 FEMALE:  That's right.
4:18 4:18 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
4:18 4:19 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you male311.
