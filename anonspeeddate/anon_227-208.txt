0:00 0:04 FEMALE: Oh, Jesus.  It's too much pressure, can't deal. 
0:05 0:08 MALE: You're also in business school.  You're also first year.  
0:08 0:14 FEMALE: [laughter] he's figured out the pattern.  So, what's up with you?
0:14 0:15 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:15 0:19 FEMALE:  I'm just trying to be friendly.  Okay, what questions do you have for me?
0:21 0:23 MALE:  Body, brains, personality, rank them in order of importance.
0:23 0:31 FEMALE: This actually isn't that hard, 'cause I'm sure I've done it before.  Um -
0:32 0:32 MALE:  Let me ask you [unintelligible] sincerity?
0:32 0:40 FEMALE:    I'd have to say personality, body and then brains.  
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Same for me, actually.
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  Really?
0:41 0:42 MALE:  Yeah.
0:43 0:49 FEMALE:  I surprised myself that I say brains last, but I think I actually don't have a high bar for that. 
0:49 0:52 MALE:  So what was the last relationship you were in?
0:53 1:00 FEMALE:  Um, I was dating somebody this summer in San Francisco and that was a disaster.  What about you?
1:00 1:07 MALE:  I've been dating -- I had been dating someone on and off for probably eight months -
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.
1:07 1:08 MALE:  Long distance -
1:08 1:08 FEMALE: Uh-oh.
1:08 1:10 MALE:  Horrible [unintelligible].
1:11 1:11 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:11 1:12 MALE: Recently terminated. 
1:12 1:19 FEMALE:  Well, long distance makes it more of a disaster, just -
1:19 1:22 MALE:  It was a bad relationship.  It started with her in another relationship -
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  That's never good.  
1:23 1:26 MALE:  [unintelligible] I learned a lot through this.
1:26 1:29 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.  Well, that's good, learning is definitely good.
1:29 1:30 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:30 1:32 FEMALE:  Hmm?
1:32 1:33 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:34 1:41 FEMALE:  Oh, my.  I wouldn't -- it depends on how you define dated.  
1:41 1:43 MALE:  Did it feel like a date?
1:43 1:55 FEMALE:  No, but I don't think anything at the GSB really feels like a date, you know what I mean?  It's never like a date.  It's either like undercover or you know, what I mean, it's kind of a secret.  I guess there are some people who go on dates. 
1:55 1:58 MALE:  Ask me a racy question?
1:58 2:00 FEMALE:  What about you?  Have you dated at the GSB?
2:00 2:00 MALE:  Yes.
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:02 2:09 MALE:  I dated a girl [unintelligible], I dated a girl in art class for -
2:09 2:11 FEMALE:  You're very undercover, 'cause I have no idea who these people are.
2:12 2:17 MALE:  [unintelligible] people in class would ask but nothing ever really came of it.
2:18 2:21 FEMALE:  You guys -- I thought you guys were all over the first year.
2:21 2:23 MALE:  See, I'll answer any question honestly.  
2:23 2:27 FEMALE:  Okay, so what do you think of the women in the first year class?
2:27 2:32 MALE:  I think on average they're not better or worse then [unintelligible] class [unintelligible].
2:32 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:32 2:38 MALE:  Um, but I'm kind of over dating GSB people generally.
2:39 2:48 FEMALE:  I can understand that.  Do you think, like, you're just not meant to be with a bu -- someone else who's got their MBA?
2:48 2:51 MALE:  That's an interesting question.  I think I'm attracted to people that are very smart -
2:51 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:51 2:56 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.
2:56 3:00 MALE:  But I acknowledge the fact that those relationships are so much harder to make work.
3:00 3:13 FEMALE:  Really?  Oh, that's a good way.  I mean, Camille's serious, she likes people who are really intelligent, but in a different way from her.  So she likes when, you know, that's why she likes the engineers, 'cause their smart but in some other way.
3:13 3:16 MALE:  That's why this is a good thing, get to meet someone outside of business school.
3:17 3:22 FEMALE:  Exactly.  So are -- who have you met here?  At school mostly?
3:22 3:23 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:23 3:25 FEMALE:  Cool.  That's very cool.  You seem very open to it. 
3:25 3:31 MALE:  I've had kind of a low bar in terms of giving [unintelligible].
3:31 3:31 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.
3:31 3:36 MALE:  [unintelligible]?
3:36 3:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But you're going back to -- aren't you going back to Australia after this?
3:41 3:42 MALE:  I'm staying in San Francisco.
3:42 3:45 FEMALE:  Oh, you are?  I didn't know that.  Where -- with um, Mackenzie, right?
3:46 3:46 MALE:  Right.
3:47 3:49 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Cool.  So, are you excited about that?
3:49 3:51 MALE:  No, [unintelligible] -
3:51 3:51 FEMALE:  No?
3:51 3:53 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:53 4:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, I would definitely be very excited about being in San Francisco.  That's very cool.  So, are you planning to just do your two years and be done with it?
4:01 4:04 MALE:  Stay here for at least [unintelligible].
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  Okay.
4:04 4:05 MALE:  [unintelligible].
4:06 4:10 FEMALE:  Just Mackenzie and then you're done?  That's a good way to get your MBA paid for, right?  
4:10 4:13 MALE:  [unintelligible].
4:13 4:13 FEMALE:  Yep.
4:13 4:17 MALE:  We could have gone [unintelligible] but we didn't -
4:17 4:18 FEMALE:  I know some things, speculation now.  I get to speculate.
