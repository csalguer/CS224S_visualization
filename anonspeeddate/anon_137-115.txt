0:03 0:04 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:05 0:14 FEMALE:  I feel like I'm at like a soccer game or something [laughter] like that with that air horn.  Like I feel like we should be doing something other than like rotating on dates or [laughter].

0:14 0:18 MALE:  You know I mean that's what makes it so funny, right.  [laughter]

0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Have you ever done anything like this before?

0:19 0:21 MALE:  No.  No.  [unintelligible] 

0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  No.

0:22 0:22 MALE:  No.

0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  No.  And--

0:23 0:26 MALE:  [unintelligible] pretty popular [unintelligible] 

0:26 0:34 FEMALE:  Yeah, I had a friend who tried convincing me to do it a couple of years ago and I was just like it sounds too bizarre and everything like that.

0:33 0:33 MALE:  I know.

0:34 0:44 FEMALE:  But I'm [unintelligible] school of education and I--I know the people who are doing it and they're like, oh, it's very interesting.  We found all these interesting things and like--it's for research.  [laughter]

0:44 0:49 MALE:  [unintelligible] when I [unintelligible] 

0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

0:49 1:01 MALE:  And then later when I was about to come here [unintelligible] I misunderstood that they're going to do like [unintelligible] 

1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  Right.

1:02 1:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  [laughter]

1:02 1:09 MALE:  [unintelligible] I'm thinking that it would be cool to know, like to get [unintelligible] about me [unintelligible] 

1:09 1:09 FEMALE:  Oh [laughter]

1:09 1:10 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:10 1:10 FEMALE:  [laughter]

1:10 1:11 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:12 1:12 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  You don't get a survey.

1:14 1:14 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:14 1:15 FEMALE:  [laughter]

1:15 1:17 MALE:  [unintelligible] that is reality like--

1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:18 1:21 MALE:  [unintelligible] and then whenever we stop like--

1:22 1:29 FEMALE:  I don't know [laughter].  I'm not sure [unintelligible] that's always a mystery.  Like on one hand you want to know but on the other hand like--

1:28 1:30 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:30 1:31 FEMALE:  Exactly.  Exactly.

1:31 1:35 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:35 1:36 FEMALE:  It'll be constructive feedback.

1:37 1:37 MALE:  Exactly.

1:37 1:38 FEMALE:  [laughter]

1:38 1:44 MALE:  [unintelligible] four minutes like [unintelligible] 

1:44 1:44 FEMALE:  Right.

1:44 1:45 MALE:  [unintelligible] that's wrong.

1:45 2:05 FEMALE:  I--I can't imagine though--I mean just with the population of students that they drew from it's--it's almost like--the one thing I think is very cool about this is the graduate community here doesn't interact at all.  And there's all these like bright, amazing, attractive people all around campus and we have no way to interact.  So now at least we're all getting to interact for four minutes.

2:06 2:06 MALE:  Right.

2:06 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah [laughter].

2:08 2:12 MALE:  [unintelligible] whatever [unintelligible]

2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:13 2:14 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:14 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's the same thing like are we really going to do work on a Thursday night?  I'm not gonna--I'm gonna go home and watch like Law and Order reruns or something [laughter].

2:21 2:22 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:22 2:24 FEMALE:  So which program are you in?

2:23 2:24 MALE:  [unintelligible]

2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  Very cool.

2:25 2:26 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  Very cool.  Uh, here at the school of education so--

2:28 2:29 MALE:  Oh yeah, I'm sorry--

2:29 2:33 FEMALE:  No, no, no, that's totally fine.  That's totally fine.  I had said it in another context so--

2:33 2:34 MALE:  So you [unintelligible] 

2:35 2:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I--well you know I regret not doing more in the sciences when I was in college.

2:40 2:40 MALE:  Really?

2:41 2:53 FEMALE:  I had horrible science teachers in high school and was so afraid to go into the sciences.  My physics teacher was just horrible.  Like the only thing I really remember from that class is physics is fun spelled P-H-U-N.  

2:54 2:55 MALE:  Oh my God.  

2:56 2:59 FEMALE:  But and I also remember playing with a slinky.  And that was a lot of fun like [unintelligible] things.

2:59 3:00 MALE:  Oh really?

3:00 3:05 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So it was very cool.  I mean there were some very cool things that we did, but that was a long time ago.  [laughter]

3:05 3:05 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  So what kind of physics are you--what are you--

3:08 3:08 MALE:  I do biophysics.

3:10 3:10 FEMALE:  Okay.

3:10 3:13 MALE:  [unintelligible] [laughter].

3:13 3:15 FEMALE:  It's incredible.  Are you--

3:14 3:15 MALE:  Oh you think so. 

3:16 3:40  FEMALE:  Well because people need to--I--I have a--I went to a liberal arts college and I think one of the things that they--that you really get from that experience is just being fascinated by knowledge, especially things you don't know or don't understand.  And so it's just always really exciting to talk to people who are doing things completely unrelated to what I do but so interesting and purposeful and everything like that so--

3:40 3:40 MALE:  So what do you?

3:41 3:50 FEMALE:  I am in a policy and administration program here.  Uh, before coming I worked in higher education and I'm interested in getting back into education and health policy research actually, so--

3:50 3:51 MALE:  Uh-huh.

3:51 3:55 FEMALE:  So that's kind of what I hope to do in the next eight weeks is find a job.  [laughter]

3:55 3:56 MALE:  Oh that's pretty soon.

3:56 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's kind of one of those nine month in and out programs, so--

4:00 4:01 MALE:  Wow [unintelligible] 

4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Anyway--

4:03 4:03 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

4:03 4:05 FEMALE:  Oh, good luck to you too.  It was fun meeting you.

4:05 4:06 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  [laughter]

4:08 4:09 MALE:  Okay, let's go around.

4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  [laughter]

4:10 4:11 MALE:  Yeah, very nice to meet you.

4:11 4:12 FEMALE:  It was really nice to meet you too.
