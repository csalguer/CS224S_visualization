0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:07 0:07 MALE:  Hey.
0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  female123.
0:08 0:08 MALE:  I'm male104.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Nice to me you.
0:09 0:09 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  How's your night been going?
0:11 0:16 MALE:  Um, I'm getting pretty tired.  I'm glad it's going to be over soon.  How about you?
0:12 0:20 FEMALE:  Um, I [unintelligible] not that bad.  It's been exhausting.  It's exhausting to continually meet new people and like find topics of conversation.
0:24 0:25 MALE:  Is this how you usually spend your Thursdays?
0:21 0:27 FEMALE:  Oh absolutely.  In fact, every single night of the week, I go to different speed datings around the city.
0:31 0:31 MALE:  Really?
0:27 0:27 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.
0:32 0:32 MALE:  Travel around?
0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  It's my occupation.
0:34 0:34 MALE:  That's cool.
0:31 0:31 FEMALE:  How about you?
0:36 0:42 MALE:  Pretty good job.  Oh yeah, I was thinking about taking up that occupation [laughter].  [unintelligible] studying every night.  But we have a curfew.
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  [laughter] What do you study?
0:43 0:44 MALE:  Uh, computer science.
0:41 0:43 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?  You're the first computer science person I've met this evening.
0:47 0:47 MALE:  Really?
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:48 0:51 MALE:  I would think the bulk [unintelligible] was computer science [unintelligible].
0:48 0:51 FEMALE:  Uh uh.  Is it a big program?  How many people?
0:55 0:57 MALE:  Yeah.  Like 300 master's students.
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  God, that's huge.
0:59 1:01 MALE:  And there's probably like 200 PhD students.
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  That's huge.
1:03 1:03 MALE:  Yeah, it's really big.
1:00 1:03 FEMALE:  And it must be heavily male [unintelligible].  
1:07 1:07 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:03 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, I would guess.  Yeah, you wouldn't think that'd be.  I've done up quite a few engineering students.
1:11 1:14 MALE:  There's a couple of girls [unintelligible], not very many. 
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  So how far are you in the program?
1:16 1:16 MALE:  My first year.
1:13 1:13 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?
1:17 1:18 MALE:  What program are you in?
1:14 1:17 FEMALE:  Law school, first year.  Yeah.
1:21 1:22 MALE:  How's it going?
1:18 1:30 FEMALE:  Um, it's fine.  It's going well.  I mean, I say that--I mean, the final's in two weeks, so I can't be that happy about law school when I, you know, should be in the library studying [unintelligible].
1:34 1:34 MALE:  Yeah.
1:31 1:34 FEMALE:  So.  I don't know.  We'll see.  We'll see.
1:39 1:39 MALE:  Yeah.
1:36 1:40 FEMALE:  So I don't know.  So what do you do for fun around here?
1:45 1:52 MALE:  Uh, lately,this semester, not much, 'cause my classes are horrible.  But last semester I was going to San Francisco a lot.
1:49 1:51 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?  Up in the city?  What part?
1:56 1:58 MALE:  All the rich just like, bars and stuff.
1:55 1:56 FEMALE:  I really like the city.
2:00 2:01 MALE:  Yeah, me too.  It's just awesome.
1:58 2:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  For some reason, I had the mistaken impression that I'd be close to the city, and I'd be going out more often than I, you know--
2:07 2:07 MALE:  Right.
2:03 2:07 FEMALE:  --actually do.  I only make it up to the city like once a week.  [unintelligible].
2:11 2:12 MALE:  Yeah, but once a week's pretty good.
2:09 2:12 FEMALE:  Yes.  It's not bad.  But I thought I'd be going up to the city quite more--quite like more often.
2:16 2:17 MALE:  Yeah.  I [unintelligible] did too.
2:13 2:17 FEMALE:  Now I'm like, oh, I'm basically in San Francisco.  I'm going to be up there all the time.
2:21 2:22 MALE:  That's why I moved to here, to be near San Francisco.
2:19 2:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, me too.  I think a lot of people end up going to Stanford thinking they're going to be able to get up to the city all the time.  But really, you end up going to fricking Palo Alto.
2:32 2:32 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:30 2:30 FEMALE:  Palo Alto sucks.
2:35 2:37 MALE:  That city is [unintelligible] I've ever been to.  It's awful.
2:33 2:35 FEMALE:  I mean, it is--it--
2:40 2:41 MALE:  There's nothing good about it.
2:38 2:42 FEMALE:  You know, there are a couple good--I mean, there are a couple good--really good restaurants.  But in terms of like an [unintelligible]--
2:46 2:46 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:43 2:43 FEMALE:  That's expensive.
2:48 2:49 MALE:  Yeah, I'm sure it has really good food, though.
2:46 2:48 FEMALE:  No, there is really good food.  Every once in a while, whatever.  That's what loans are for.
2:53 2:53 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
2:50 2:51 FEMALE:  You know, just enjoy yourself.
2:55 2:55 MALE:  Yeah.
2:51 2:55 FEMALE:  But um, it's good.  Uh, have you ever been to Rudy's?
3:01 3:02 MALE:  Is that downtown?
2:59 3:07 FEMALE:  Downtown P.A.  This was the scariest place I've ever been to.  My friend really likes to dance, [unintelligible] at Rudy's.  It's like in the first block of University, when you come under the bridge.
3:12 3:16 MALE:  Oh, there's like, there's like two clubs across from each other when you go downtown.
3:12 3:13 FEMALE:  What are you thinking of?
3:18 3:24 MALE:  'Cause there's like a, um, there's like an Asian club, and there's like a Irish [unintelligible]--
3:20 3:22 FEMALE:  I've never been to either of those places, actually.
3:26 3:27 MALE:  They're like the first two places you see downtown.
3:24 3:28 FEMALE:  Oh. Oh no, so, Rudy's is the Irish place.  I've never been to the Asian place.
3:32 3:32 MALE:  Okay.
3:29 3:47 FEMALE:  Okay.  And it was like the--she really likes to dance, and she wanted to go to Rudy's.  So apparently, they have hip hop dancing.  It's the sketchiest place I've ever been to.  It's like 45 year-old divorcee women, and like 60 year-old men.  Everyone was, you know--it's not your stereotypical--it was refreshing that it wasn't your stereotypical white upper class--
3:51 3:51 MALE:  No.
3:47 3:50 FEMALE:  --white Palo Alto people.  But at the same time--
3:55 3:55 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:51 3:52 FEMALE:  It was [unintelligible].
3:56 3:56 MALE:  Have you been to the Nuthouse?
3:53 3:54 FEMALE:  Oh I love the Nuthouse, but--
3:58 3:59 MALE:  It's fucking awesome.
3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  One dollar margaritas, during lunchtime.
4:01 4:02 MALE:  Yes.  That place is right on.
3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No, I love Nuthouse.
4:04 4:04 MALE:  Yeah.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  It was great talking to you.
4:07 4:07 MALE:  Yeah, you too.
