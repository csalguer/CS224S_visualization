0:00:04.9 0:00:07.1 MALE:  It's almost [unintelligible].  Ah.
0:00:03.6 0:00:04.0 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:00:07.7 0:00:08.7 MALE:  Another French name.
0:00:06.0 0:00:06.5 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.
0:00:10.0 0:00:14.0 MALE:  Another French first name.  She's nameX, and there was someone who was a-
0:00:09.8 0:00:10.2 FEMALE:  Oh.
0:00:16.1 0:00:18.3 MALE:  Another French names, anyway, where are you from?
0:00:15.1 0:00:16.0 FEMALE:  Uh, I'm from Oregon.
0:00:19.9 0:00:20.8 MALE:  From Oregon, okay.
0:00:17.5 0:00:18.3 FEMALE:  You're from France?  
0:00:21.8 0:00:25.6 MALE:  Yeah.  [laughter]  Yeah, right.  So, uh-
0:00:21.4 0:00:22.7 FEMALE:  Cool.  What- what part of France?

0:00:29.4 0:00:32.3 MALE:  Uh, yeah, no, I grew up in uh, Brittany.
0:00:29.4 0:00:29.8 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:33.4 0:00:39.1 MALE:  Uh, but I- I studied in Paris.  'Cause in France, I mean, Paris is uh, it's very centralized.
0:00:35.5 0:00:36.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:39.5 0:00:42.3 MALE:  Every [laughter] if you want to study, you have to go to Paris.
0:00:39.1 0:00:40.3 FEMALE:  Sure.  Sure.
0:00:43.6 0:00:46.7 MALE:  Where are you- where are you in- where are you from in Oregon?  Portland?
0:00:43.6 0:00:45.7 FEMALE:  Corvalis.  Corvalis?  
0:00:49.3 0:00:49.7 MALE:  I don't know.
0:00:45.8 0:00:48.1 FEMALE:  It's- it's 90 miles south of Portland.  
0:00:51.8 0:00:54.3 MALE:  Okay, I just know Portland.  [laughter]
0:00:49.0 0:00:51.3 FEMALE:  It's not a big town.  Yeah.
0:00:55.3 0:00:57.1 MALE:  So, and what department are- are you here?
0:00:54.0 0:00:54.5 FEMALE:  Biology.
0:00:58.3 0:01:02.9 MALE:  Biology, oh, okay, cool.  You're the first biologist.  I think you're the only one biologist of the-
0:01:00.3 0:01:04.0 FEMALE:  There's someone else from my department here, so you're going to see another one.  But-
0:01:05.1 0:01:10.0 MALE:  Oh, okay.  And what- what kind of uh, you on master's or- 
0:01:07.0 0:01:07.7 FEMALE:  PhD program.
0:01:10.6 0:01:11.7 MALE:  PhD, okay.
0:01:08.6 0:01:09.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:12.3 0:01:15.0 MALE:  And what kind of uh, your PhD's about what?
0:01:12.0 0:01:13.8 FEMALE:  Uh, plant biology, so-
0:01:16.7 0:01:17.1 MALE:  What was that?
0:01:14.1 0:01:15.1 FEMALE:  Plant biology.  
0:01:18.2 0:01:18.6 MALE:  Plant?
0:01:15.5 0:01:16.1 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:01:19.1 0:01:19.8 MALE:  Biology.
0:01:16.7 0:01:19.9 FEMALE:  Uh, the- the response of the plants to global environmental change.  
0:01:23.6 0:01:27.6 MALE:  That's good.  Are you working on- with the theory of evolution [unintelligible]
0:01:24.5 0:01:28.2 FEMALE:  No, um, what I do is- is more ecology, than evolution.
0:01:31.4 0:01:31.9 MALE:  Okay.
0:01:28.7 0:01:34.7 FEMALE:  Um, so more about the- the interactions of organisms than how organisms got to be the way they are.
0:01:38.2 0:01:38.8 MALE:  Okay.
0:01:35.6 0:01:37.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What do you do?  
0:01:40.4 0:01:42.8 MALE:  Uh, it's, uh, research, in solar physics.
0:01:40.1 0:01:41.1 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  
0:01:44.6 0:01:56.4 MALE:  So- But I'm very interested in biology, actually.  I [laughter] and especially theory of evolution.  I uh, I read a book- uh, stuff about the evolution of plant- plants.
0:01:53.9 0:01:54.3 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
0:01:57.6 0:02:00.3 MALE:  So, we're the first [unintelligible]
0:01:56.9 0:01:57.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
0:02:00.1 0:02:03.3 MALE:  [laughter]  so that's why I like it.
0:01:58.8 0:02:04.7 FEMALE:  Really, the evolution- evolution of plants is fascinating, it's great.  Um, so, are you- are you in geology or- 
0:02:07.7 0:02:10.5 MALE:  No, no, no, uh, uh, physics, well, so-
0:02:07.6 0:02:08.9 FEMALE:  Oh, I thought you said soil physics.
0:02:11.8 0:02:12.7 MALE:  Yeah, solar, solar.
0:02:09.9 0:02:12.0 FEMALE:  Oh, solar, okay.  [laughter]
0:02:13.5 0:02:23.8 MALE:  Yeah.  But I- I- have to train to say correctly, because each time I say solar physics, people say, yeah, yeah? and then they're like, what is it exactly?  It's the sun.  Oh, okay.  
0:02:21.5 0:02:22.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
0:02:24.5 0:02:29.4 MALE:  So, I- I unfortunately have a big, thick French accent, so- 
0:02:27.3 0:02:28.5 FEMALE:  Yeah, your English is very good.  
0:02:32.4 0:02:34.3 MALE:  Thank you.  [laughter]  So, I- 
0:02:31.5 0:02:33.9 FEMALE:  So, what- what about the sun?  I mean-
0:02:37.0 0:02:48.7 MALE:  Well, so, I- I do um, solar models.  So- so physical stuff, how the sun produce- produces energy and- and so I- I passed a PhD in astrophysics, actually.
0:02:46.1 0:02:46.7 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:02:48.9 0:02:53.6 MALE:  And then, uh, I had this opportunity to work at Stanford, so-
0:02:51.5 0:02:54.2 FEMALE:  So, you're- you're like in a post-doc position, or- 
0:02:56.0 0:02:57.2 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.
0:02:54.1 0:02:56.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  Who do you work with? 
0:02:59.8 0:03:04.2 MALE:  Uh, Phillipe Chieran.  The professor is Phillipe Chieran, Phillipe Chieran.  
0:03:00.6 0:03:01.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:04.7 0:03:07.7 MALE:  And uh, he's- there is only one faculty in my lab.
0:03:05.3 0:03:05.7 FEMALE:  Oh.  
0:03:08.9 0:03:10.9 MALE:  Because solar physics, you know, it uh-
0:03:08.9 0:03:09.8 FEMALE:  It's not a huge field?  
0:03:12.6 0:03:18.1 MALE:  Yeah, it's not the kind of field uh, you can get a position with, I mean a permanent position, with.  
0:03:16.0 0:03:17.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
0:03:19.4 0:03:26.8 MALE:  But it's okay, there are, I mean, they have enough money at Stanford, so there's no problem.  And-
0:03:24.8 0:03:27.3 FEMALE:  Yeah, and how do you, how do you like your lab?  How do you like it here?  
0:03:29.9 0:03:31.3 MALE:  Uh, very much.
0:03:28.7 0:03:29.2 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
0:03:31.3 0:03:35.3 MALE:  I mean, it's great- it's a great country.  I'm French, I shouldn't say that.  
0:03:33.0 0:03:34.6 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:03:36.3 0:03:37.2 MALE:  God bless the U.S.
0:03:34.3 0:03:39.0 FEMALE:  Is it- I don't know that you shouldn't say that, it's not a popular opinion- but-
0:03:41.6 0:03:50.1 MALE:  So, uh, and I actually I refused a job, I was offered a position in France, and I refused it, to stay in California.  So-
0:03:47.8 0:03:48.2 FEMALE:  Wow.  
0:03:51.5 0:03:55.6 MALE:  Yeah, it's very different from France, and- but I- I prefer.  So.
0:03:53.3 0:03:53.7 FEMALE:  Really?
0:03:56.2 0:03:56.7 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:54.0 0:03:55.2 FEMALE:  So are you going to try to stay here?
0:03:57.7 0:04:01.0 MALE:  I try to stay here, if I can.  So- 
0:03:57.4 0:03:59.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Wow.
0:04:02.9 0:04:05.1 [horn]
0:04:02.8 0:04:07.0 MALE:  And you?  That is very fast.
0:04:04.7 0:04:05.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04:07.4 0:04:09.4 MALE:  Well sorry I speak, uh, I spoke [unintelligible]
0:04:06.6 0:04:07.8 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:04:09.8 0:04:10.6 MALE:  It was nice to meet you.
0:04:07.9 0:04:08.6 FEMALE:  Good to meet you.
