0:59 1:00 MALE: Somewhat.  
1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:02 1:11 MALE:  I think the reason I choose engineering was because like the way the whole Asian families are structured, and I never see my family there.  
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  What's your background?  
1:13 1:14 MALE:  Chinese.  
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] Chinese?  
1:18 1:24 MALE:  So not from Taiwan, not from Hong Kong.  I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia, but my grandparents came from China.  
1:24 1:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No, there are a lot of Chinese [unintelligible].  
1:26 1:29 MALE:  What about you?  
1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  My parents are from Taiwan.  
1:30 1:36 MALE:  From Taiwan.  So, what--what do you like to do for fun?  
1:37 1:40 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] uhm.
1:41 1:41 MALE:  You seem like--
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I like fun.  
1:43 1:44 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:44 1:51 FEMALE:  I mostly hang out with my girlfriends, my guy friends.  I'm actually here with three of my best friends from the law school.  
1:51 1:52 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:52 1:56 FEMALE:  I like sports.  I like to ski.  I like [unintelligible].  
1:56 1:57 MALE:  I see.  
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  What about you?  
2:00 2:08 MALE:  I just like the usual stuff like reading, like hiking, and outdoors, skiing, alpine skiing, and recently--
2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Did you ski in [unintelligible]?  
2:09 2:13 MALE:  Yeah, I ski in [unintelligible].  We [unintelligible] a resort.  
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  Very [unintelligible].  
2:15 2:17 MALE:  What's that?  I said I've never been to the North [unintelligible].  
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  We are like--have you been skiing for a long time?  
2:20 2:22 MALE:  Like three years now.  
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, but you're pretty good?  
2:24 2:25 MALE:  I'm--like I don't do the black diamonds.  
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  No?  
2:26 2:27 MALE:  No.  
2:27 2:29 FEMALE:  Where is there [unintelligible] good still?  
2:31 2:41 MALE:  It's just that people that I go with we just don't go to [unintelligible].  We just go to Sugar Bowl, Heavenly, and other things, which I know are [unintelligible].  But they're just [unintelligible] sub-prime.  So we did a day trip all of this time.  
2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:42 2:54 MALE:  So we would wake up at around five or so, and he would come to my place around six.  And we'd get there around ten after breakfast and then go back home again, eat dinner, and then [unintelligible].  
2:56 3:06 FEMALE: Then drive home.  Yeah, it does seem really [unintelligible] on North [unintelligible].  Like I didn't see many people from the Bay Area to go [unintelligible].  That's where all the action is.  That's where the cars are.  That's where heavenly is.  
3:06 3:08 MALE:  How long have you been skiing?  
3:08 3:13 FEMALE:  I grew up in [unintelligible], so I've been skiing with my family at Tahoe ever since it [unintelligible].  
3:13 3:16 MALE:  I see.  So you're part--fortunate I guess.  
3:16 3:27 FEMALE:  Well, that's it--I wasn't really very lucky though.  It was just something that my parents introduced us to [unintelligible] the younger you start really the better you end up.  
3:27 3:32 MALE:  Almost for everything, almost for everything, right?  The younger you start the better you're at.  
3:32 3:44 FEMALE:  Especially something like skiing where there is [unintelligible] in-riggers, you know.  I know [unintelligible] take the kind of risk that you need to really get to the rhythm that you need.  
3:45 3:46 MALE:  Uh-huh.  I see.  
3:47 3:54 FEMALE:  But, no [unintelligible] really be looking at is to measure of people [unintelligible] much better.  So, the next time you and your friends go [unintelligible] think of that, checking in [unintelligible].  
3:55 4:13 MALE:  I should, yeah.  Uhm, I see.  Yeah, talking about how you recently just started [unintelligible], and that's--this is a [unintelligible] reason like you mentioned, which is very important.  It was nice meeting you.  
4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you too.  
4:15 4:15 MALE:  See you round.  
4:16 4:16 FEMALE:  Bye.
