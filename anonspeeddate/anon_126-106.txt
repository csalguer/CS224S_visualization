00:01  	00:01  	MALE:  I don't know.  I think that was --

00:02  	00:03  	FEMALE:  Have we started or was that just a [unintelligible]?

00:04  	00:04  	MALE:  [unintelligible] [laughter].

00:04  	00:05  	FEMALE:  They didn't look at me.

00:09  	00:10  	MALE:  [laughter] we'll wait an extra two seconds, after we start [horn].  All right.

00:13  	00:13  	FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female126.

00:14 	00:18  	MALE:  I'm male106.  Nice to meet you.  So what do you do here?

00:20  	00:21  	FEMALE:  I am a Master student in electrical engineering.

00:21  	00:21  	MALE:  Ah-huh.

00:22  	00:22  	FEMALE:  How about you?

00:24  	00:25  	MALE:  I'm Masters in Computer Science.

00:25  	00:26  	FEMALE:  Right across the street from each other.

00:26  	00:26  	MALE:  Ah-huh, yeah.

00:27  	00:27  	FEMALE:  Where did you do your undergrad?

00:28  	00:29	MALE:  At Berkley, how about you?

00:30  	00:32  	FEMALE:  Oh, University of Virginia, big university right?

00:33  	00:34  	MALE:  Yeah, that's right, public schools.

00:34  	00:38  	FEMALE:  Oh, well I'm -- I'm a big fan of the public schools for undergrad.

00:38  	00:49  	MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know about it for private for undergrad.  I think it probably goes to have the public school experience.

00:49 	01:09  	FEMALE:  At least from talking to people it seems like there's a much bigger social aspect to the undergrad to go to public schools.  And so, of course I've never gone to a private school, except grad school.  But it seems like everyone I talked to that went to public school loved it as an undergrad and most people come to the private just for the academics.

01:09  	01:10  	MALE:  Yeah, I think so [unintelligible].

01:10  	01:19  	FEMALE:  One thing I really like about the University of Virginia was it a huge -- the engineering school was small, but the university was large.  So it had all the benefits of the arts and stuff came [unintelligible].

01:20  	01:20  	MALE:  That's nice.

01:21  	01:29  	FEMALE:  So then I had a small friendly atmosphere in my program.  You know like all of the professors they knew me and I really liked that small pool than a big pool thing.

01:30  	01:39  	MALE:  That's cool.  Yeah, I guess Berkeley had a big engineering department also, but I mean I liked it a lot compared to here, because like --

01:39  	01:40  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible]

01:40  	01:49  	MALE:  Yeah, everyone you here went to Berkeley.  Completely different thing.  I think -- it would probably be fun here as an undergrad, but a lot different.

01:49	01:51  	FEMALE:  It's not a college town.  

01:51	01:57  	MALE:  They don't go out really.  Well they go to -- they stay on campus.

01:57  	02:01  	FEMALE:  They stay on campus to go out, which is totally different from my experience in Virginia.

02:01 	02:01  	MALE:  Yeah, completely.

02:01  	02:05  	FEMALE:  Everyone went out, so.  So it's really different.

02:05  	02:08  	MALE:  Yeah [laughter].  So --

02:10  	02:13  	FEMALE:  So you would have been in the same department if I had gone to Berkeley, is that --

02:13  	02:26  	MALE:  Yes, we would have, yeah.  Where are you from before that?

02:17  	02:27	FEMALE:  I -- well, I grew up in New York near -- a little north of the city and then my family moved to California while I was in high school.  It's in [unintelligible].

02:27  	02:27  	MALE:  I don't know where that is.

02:28  	02:31  	FEMALE:  It's at the intersection of 580 and 680 so just south of Berkeley.  What about you?

02:32 	02:36  	MALE:  Minnesota.  And yeah --

02:36  	02:37  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  

02:38	02:38  	MALE:  Yeah it is.  They are very [unintelligible].

02:39  	02:41  	FEMALE:  Did you go right to Berkeley?

02:42  	02:43  	MALE:  Yeah, I haven't wasted any time.

02:44  	02:44  	FEMALE:  Same here.

02:44  	02:52  	MALE:  Yeah [laughter].  Do you like here at all or?  Or gotten used to it?

02:50  	03:02  	FEMALE: I think its growing on me.  I hated my first quarter.  Only because I didn't know anyone.  You know as an undergrad you meet a thousand people in your first week.  From here I probably meet three.

03:02  	03:09  	MALE:  Especially for a Masters.  I think like a PhD the end of paying all the people in your group are in your major -- it's a smaller one.

03:09  	03:12  	FEMALE:  I don't know how big Computer Science is but Electrical Engineering 250 [unintelligible].

03:12  	03:14  	MALE:  It's ridiculous, yeah.

03:14  	03:20  	FEMALE:  So, it's stupid to do -- to get to know your orientation.  Our orientation was here's the facts now get out.  

03:20  	03:21  	MALE:  Yeah, ah-huh.

03:21  	03:33  	FEMALE:  And so I didn't meet, I met one person at orientation they guy sitting right next to me and that was it.  But my roommates are in biology, they went on a camping trip, had a get to know you dinners and bar night.

03:33  	03:33  	MALE:  Right, yeah.

03:34  	03:35  	FEMALE:  We didn't have that.

03:36  	03:42  	MALE:  And the EE computer science grad students are a mixed bag at best.  Okay [laughter].

03:42  	03:44  	FEMALE:  They are.

03:45  	03:48  	MALE:  Another issue, it's not us as far as --

03:48  	03:57  	FEMALE: But I figure that you know there's so many coming here, because none of us anti-social people would come [unintelligible], not sure.

03:57  	04:01  	MALE:  [laughter], yeah I guess we'll find out.  Most likely.

04:01  	04:05  	FEMALE:  So what do you do when you're not working on the computer.

04:05  	04:15  	MALE:  I guess I've been taking a few trips [unintelligible], I went to Tahoe and I'm going to Vegas this weekend and otherwise [horn], we'll on to someone else [laughter].  It was nice to meet you.

04:16  	04:17  	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
