2:27 2:28 FEMALE: It's really hard.  
2:28 2:35 MALE: It's like such a contradiction, because it's like, some ki- yeah, you- you want kids to respect you and you need to be an authority in the classroom.
2:36 2:36 FEMALE: Right.  
2:36 2:38 MALE: But kids are, you don't want to, you don't want to abuse your power.
2:37 2:39 FEMALE: You also want to be friendly, you don't want to be distant.  Yeah.
2:38 2:42 MALE: Right, 'cause it's so easy for kids to feel like, they don't want to learn because there's this-- 
2:43 2:43 FEMALE: Right.

3:04 3:05 MALE: Did you go in straight from undergrad?
3:05 3:12 FEMALE: I did.  So, and I did my undergrad here, so this is my sixth year at Stanford, sixth year, six more to go.  But uh--

3:26 3:44 FEMALE: I, exactly, it'd be very true, very true.  I- I've learned that Stanford is not necessarily like the wild or preservative like, you know, everything is like, that's why I'm kind of like staying here, you know, I really like it, but yeah.  At some point I'll probably have to leave, and then that will be kind of sad.  But you know, it's the nature of it.  
3:45 3:48 MALE: I met a couple people, um, in like the math department and another department from Serbia.
3:49 3:49 FEMALE: Oh!
