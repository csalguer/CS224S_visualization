00:01  	00:01  	MALE:  [horn]

00:07  	00:28  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible]. I really enjoy Professor nameX lectures and it's interesting that -- I'm definitely interested in the material.  But I don't have the time this quarter to devote to it. So I don't want to take the class and just sort of try, get my pass and then never come back to it. 

00:29  	00:29 	MALE:  Right, right, right.

00:29  	00:43  	FEMALE:  It's the kind of thing that in two years I would really like to take the class to write -- because basically this is sort of I'm not sure -- I want to stay for the PhD, but I'm trying to decide if I really want the PhD or --

00:43  	00:43  	MALE:  Yeah.

00:44  	00:57  	FEMALE:  So if I don't get the PhD, I want to be exposed to the material so I'm sitting in on it.  But if I stay for the PhD in two years I'd like to actually take the class and hearing once before will help my understanding.

00:57  	01:01	MALE:  Right.  Definitely, definitely.  But you like plan your PhD on which kind if thing?

01:02  	01:07  	FEMALE:  Well, actually I'm changing it. When I got here I really am enjoying the medical imaging.

01:08  	01:08  	MALE:  Ah-huh, ah-huh.

01:09  	01:11  	FEMALE:  Sort of more in the signal processing direction.

01:11  	01:12  	MALE:  Right, right.

01:13  	01:15  	FEMALE:  I came intending to do something like wireless circuits.

01:15  	01:16  	MALE:  Oh, okay.

01:17  	01:18  	FEMALE:  It's totally changed [laughter].

01:19  	01:20  	MALE:  But that's okay, yeah.  

01:21  	01:29  	FEMALE:  And that's one of the reasons I came to a place like Stanford it's a huge department.  So if I decide, you know if I come to a small school and I change my mind, I could be stuck.

01:29  	01:29  	MALE:   Right.

01:30  	01:31  	FEMALE:  So --

01:31  	01:44  	MALE:  Well, that's the same story I have, like I didn't take [unintelligible] my first year.  I did my second year.  I wanted to do totally different research and then I landed in [unintelligible].  

01:44  	01:45  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Good catch.

01:47  	01:52  	MALE:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  He's a very, very smart guy.

01:52  	01:56  	FEMALE:  Oh and he's an excellent lecturer.  I mean --

01:56  	01:56  	MALE:  Oh definitely.

01:57  	02:11  	FEMALE:  He said some things that about [unintelligible] linear algebra.  I remember learning about - you know I remember the professor talked about it, but not getting it.  And in one sentence he said stuff I could have understood in high school.  You know and I thought --

02:11  	02:12  	MALE:  That -- that's the whole point.

02:13  	02:14  	FEMALE:  He should be telling high school students this.

02:15  	02:19  	MALE:  Well, yeah.  In the School of Education [unintelligible] these things [laughter].

02:20  	02:24  	FEMALE:  But actually, Professor nameX is my Masters advisor.

02:24  	02:24  	MALE:  Ah.

02:25  	02:35  	FEMALE:  And I [laughter] -- at one point I kind of wanted to tell him that he made want to be a high school teacher.  Because I thought we need linear algebra teacher's like that in high school.

02:35  	02:35  	MALE:  Correct.  

02:36  	02:43  	FEMALE:  Because one of the main reasons I think we have trouble getting engineers -- people excited about engineering is because they hate math.

02:44  	02:45  	MALE:  Oh yeah, that's true.

02:45  	02:48  	FEMALE:  Math is not as hard as high school teachers make it out to be.

02:48  	02:48  	MALE:  Right.

02:49  	02:52  	FEMALE:  In high school I took it, I could not understand it, I hated it.

02:52  	02:52  	MALE:  Oh, yeah?

02:53  	03:02  	FEMALE:  It was so hard, but it was because I had a bad teacher.  How basically would write the assignment on the board and sit in his office and you could ask him questions but then you had to learn it on your own.

03:02  	03:13  	MALE:  Yeah.  And sometimes impressions about mathematics and science go deep like in your fifth or sixth grade when you are introduced to like when people are introduced to their math teacher who was very, very bad at the simple --

03:13	03:13	FEMALE:  Right.

03:14	03:16	MALE:  Things which you learn there.

03:16  	03:25  	FEMALE: I think one of the main reasons that I am an engineer is because my -- my dad made math fun.  You know we could just talk about it.  I said well why is this and rather than tell me the answer --

03:24  	03:26  	MALE:  Is he -- is he an engineer.

03:26  	03:26  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

03:28  	03:28  	MALE:  So, where does stay?

03:28  	03:29  	FEMALE:  Um.

03:29  	03:34  	MALE:  Your dad, like where does stay, like where in the United States?

03:34  	03:35  	FEMALE:  Well he died, so but he --

03:36  	03:36  	MALE:  Oh sorry.

03:37  	03:41  	FEMALE:  Oh, no it's okay [laughter], so he used to be in California.

03:42  	03:42  	MALE:  Okay.

03:43  	03:47  	FEMALE:  So you know growing up we could talk about things.  Why is this?  And he would say what do you think about this?

03:47  	03:48  	MALE:  Right.

03:48  	03:51  	FEMALE: And I would walk one direction and he would say well think about this other side. 

03:51 	03:52  	MALE:  Correct.

03:52  	03:53  	FEMALE:  So it became more like a puzzle you know?

03:54  	04:01  	MALE:  Yeah.  It's just like introducing -- getting your brain to think logically introduces the mathematical and all [horn] that kind of stuff.

04:02  	04:07  	FEMALE:  And so if you make it enjoyable, people are going to want to stick with it.  Like school teachers don't do that.

04:08  	04:08  	MALE:  Ah-huh, okay.  

04:09 	04:11  	FEMALE:  Good talking to you.

04:12 	04:12  	MALE:  Yep.
