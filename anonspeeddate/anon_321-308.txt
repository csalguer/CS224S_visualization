                      FEMALE:  Hi.
0:00:06.8  0:00:07.2  MALE:  Good to meet you.
                      FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:00:09.2  0:00:14.6  MALE:  [unintelligible] we can't start.  [unintelligible].
(Background directions)
                      FEMALE:  [inaudible].
0:00:25.2  0:00:42.8  MALE:  I'm not.  I mean uni.  [unintelligible] you know like when you hear your voice recorded in your, you know, voice mail message.  It somehow never sounds as good.  Well maybe that's just a problem I have.  Yours has much better uni.  Listening to an hour of this would be devastating, I'm sure. 
                      FEMALE:  [unintelligible] [laughter].
0:00:43.4  0:00:55.7  MALE:  uni.  Okay, I feel totally awkward saying this uni. 
                      FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:00:58.1  0:00:58.3  MALE:  Thank you.
                      FEMALE:  Can you comment um, to yourself?
0:01:00.0  0:01:03.9  MALE:  Well I didn't uni.  I just uni. 
(Background noise and talking.  Directions).
0:03:25.3  0:03:29.1  MALE:  [unintelligible] do you uni?  Do you?
0:00:03.5  0:00:05.8  FEMALE:  No.
0:03:30.0  0:03:39.2  MALE:  You know, I don't either, but at this summer it's like one of my goals.  I'm going to learn how to cook.  Actually I'm like, should I be less enthused about this than I am?
0:00:15.7  0:00:16.6  FEMALE:  [laughter] No, no.
0:03:41.5  0:03:42.9  MALE:  [laughter]
0:00:17.3  0:00:19.9  FEMALE:  No, I'm just a little paranoid about when the bell's going to ring.
0:03:43.8  0:03:45.9  MALE:  Oh, that's a good point.
0:00:20.2  0:00:22.3  FEMALE:  Because that scares me.
0:03:46.2  0:03:54.7  MALE:  It's a little bizzare.  I guess they want something that shows up on their tape.  It's the only way.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt because otherwise something a little more subtle could have been used.
0:00:30.4  0:00:36.1  FEMALE:  No.  Yeah.  But it would be fun because by my time I would learn how to make bread really nice and pizza.
0:04:00.2  0:04:15.2  MALE:  My [unintelligible] loves baking bread.  It's one of these things my mom was like, yeah, let's get into this.  Yeah.  She, she knew.  Yeah.  Anyway so, it seems like a good hobby.  That's hardcore though.  I'm talking about like [unintelligible] [laughter].
0:00:50.6  0:00:52.4  FEMALE:  Have you seen Eat Drink Man Woman?
0:04:16.5  0:04:19.0  MALE:  Oh, yeah.  That's a great movie.
0:00:52.6  0:01:04.6  FEMALE:  Remember when that chef was talking about how--or the daughter he has tension with said, "Oh, when I was little he used to make me like bread rings and bracelets." 
0:04:29.1  0:04:33.0  MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  That would be pretty cool actually.
0:01:07.8  0:01:14.5  FEMALE:  Yeah.  I visualized that in my head when I saw that movie.  I was like, you know, I just couldn't imagine sugar emeralds and stuff.
0:04:38.7  0:04:45.7  MALE:  I'll tell this day it wouldn't last very long if they were on my wrist or finger.  But yeah, it'd be good for a little bit.  And I'd enjoy eating them.
0:01:20.8  0:01:27.1  FEMALE:  Yes.  I, I would enjoy the crime I would commit of like consuming somebody's heart.
0:04:51.8  0:04:55.1  MALE:  You're uni.  So what do you study?
0:01:30.3  0:01:31.2  FEMALE:  Education.
0:04:56.3  0:04:57.3  MALE:  Cool.  Are you a master's, PHD?
0:01:33.5  0:01:37.2  FEMALE:  I'm a master's student; but I'm feeling like a PHD student.
0:05:01.5  0:05:06.2  MALE:  Tonight especially or you mean just, yeah, in general it's little more than you--
0:01:41.2  0:01:44.6  FEMALE:  [interposing] I'm just tired to be quite honest.  Like I have a paper due next week.
0:05:08.9  0:05:11.2  MALE:  This is a master's thesis?
0:01:46.4  0:01:46.7  FEMALE:  Yes.
0:05:11.3  0:05:12.7  MALE:  Wow.  What's it on?
0:01:48.0  0:01:50.1  FEMALE:  It's on women of color applying to graduate school.
0:05:14.6  0:05:35.5  MALE:  That's a fantastic topic.  There's just, um, this big stew over at--I'm in the law school--this guy Richard Sandards wrote this paper about afirmative action in law schools.  Ah, then it got covered by all the newspapers.  I actually didn't read it so I can't tell you much about it.  But it's sort of like similar and very interesting.
0:02:10.8  0:02:15.0  FEMALE:  I think I vaguely hear--remember hearing that or seeing that.  And I didn't read it either, but.
0:05:39.7  0:05:55.3  MALE:  I think it was saying, you know, because Stanford's generally perceived as a pretty liberal place.  And this was like [unintelligible] like affirmative action is a bad thing.  I'ts [unintelligible] whatever.  So what comes after this?  Are you thinking about teaching or pursing research more or...?
0:02:30.8  0:02:35.1  FEMALE:  I like to research.  I think it would be good to actually do something a little different.  Maybe student affairs.
0:06:00.1  0:06:01.3  MALE:  That would be pretty cool.
0:02:36.3  0:02:44.3  FEMALE:  And trying to get a job in that.  I'm a very social person.  I'm a very network type person.  And I like to do--work with student organizations.
0:06:08.4  0:06:12.2  MALE:  Oh then you'd be working with student the rest of your life.  I think it would be fabulous.
0:02:46.9  0:02:56.4  FEMALE:  Yes.  Yeah.  Well I have a very youthful nature.  For some reason people mistake me for either a 16-year-old or a freshman in college for the last couple of years.
0:06:20.6  0:06:26.6  MALE:  See, the funny thing is, that's absolutely of no use to you now.  But you know that in 30 years you'll like that a lot [laughter].
0:03:01.2  0:03:06.4  FEMALE:  [laughter] I hope I don't stay--I wouldn't mind if I stay that way in a couple, you know, ten years or something.
0:06:31.2  0:06:42.9  MALE:  [laughter] that's true.  If I [unintelligible] as early as ten years I would.  Um, I am, you know, one of these people that freaked out about turning 20.  I just felt really old at that point.  So I think I wouldn't mind having this problem as well.
0:03:17.3  0:03:18.5  FEMALE:  When you turned 20?
0:06:43.3  0:06:49.9  MALE:  Ah, yeah.  I was one of these kids--when I turned 18 I was like oh my teens are almost done.  I freaked out.
0:03:25.3  0:03:28.4  FEMALE:  Wow.  That's so cool.  I felt that way too.  You're the only person I know who said that. 
0:06:52.8  0:06:58.6  MALE:  [unintelligible] just actually--but, yeah, I think I've kind of dealt with my aging problems a little  bit.  I kind of uni.
0:03:34.4  0:03:35.7  FEMALE:  It's by the man.  Don't let the man get you down.  The man has brainwashed us.
0:07:02.4  0:07:12.3  MALE:  It's, you know, it's a media perpetrated issue.  No question about it.  I, I'm serious.  Now 30 or 40 we'll see how [unintelligible] go down, but.  So how've you like it then?
0:03:47.7  0:03:49.7  FEMALE:  It's stressful.
0:07:13.6  0:07:15.4  MALE:  Where were you before? 
0:03:51.0  0:03:56.1  FEMALE:  Um, well I did another master's before this and then I like, before that I went to Wesleyan.
0:07:20.4  0:07:22.9  MALE:  Where was, where was your other master's at?
0:03:58.1  0:03:59.5  FEMALE:  Education [laughter].
0:07:23.8  0:07:29.0  MALE:  I knew--speaking of Wesleyan uni.  This is like, I don't know what year you got out, Justin Perdell [phonetic].
0:04:05.5  0:04:10.1  FEMALE:  I'm good at faces, but I don't really remember some names.  When did he um, graduate?
0:07:32.2  0:07:38.0  MALE:  You know, I don't even know.  I want to say maybe 2000 or so.
0:04:13.1  0:04:15.0  FEMALE:  I might have known him because I was 2001.
0:07:39.8  0:07:46.4  MALE:  I was 2001 as well.  Um, I can try to describe him, but that wouldn't help you at all.
0:04:21.5  0:04:23.0  FEMALE:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
0:07:46.7  0:07:53.4  MALE:  I'd be like, well he's got kind of blondish/brown hair.  Of course.  That's cool.  Where was your--what was your other bachelor's degree in?
0:04:28.8  0:04:32.2  FEMALE:  Um, education.  Um, I had a blast with that one.
0:07:56.9  0:07:58.9  MALE:  That was more like general.
0:04:33.6  0:04:33.8  FEMALE:  Yes.
0:07:58.4  0:08:00.6  MALE:  [unintelligible] kind of.  And this one's more--
0:04:36.0  0:04:50.4  FEMALE:  [interposing] Yes.  It was general in the sense that I just took the--explored the broad feild of education by taking classes in histroy, history of women's education, media stuff, um, art and education--
0:08:14.8  0:08:15.9  MALE:  [interposing] yeah.
0:04:50.8  0:04:55.8  FEMALE:  --um, human development and psycology.  Actually was blessed enough to get into one class with [unintelligible] Gardner.
0:08:20.7  0:08:24.0  MALE:  Now I'm really embarrased.  who is this person?
0:04:59.3  0:05:12.0  FEMALE:  Oh, he, he's like this theorist.  I was at Harvard Graduate School of Education.  It was like intimidating because he's like a genius or whatever.  But he's also like a big dork.  So it was like, nice.
0:08:37.0  0:08:42.3  MALE:  You--once you actually get to know him uni.  It was so good to meet you.
0:05:17.6  0:05:17.9  FEMALE:  Nice to meet you too.
