00:22 00:24 MALE: Seriously--I need, like, I need an hour to figure out a whole system.  I know.  
00:24 00:32 FEMALE: Maybe you don't know, like, I'm, like, I don't remember.  And then, I'm, like, oh, yes you do.  And then you can trust yourself, like, [unintelligible].  But that was the first, you know, if you don't have a method of comparing [unintelligible].

00:48 00:58 FEMALE: Oh, actually, I'm sorry-- she's in the education school but she--it's in conjunction with the business school and I guess they're doing something for, like, I mean, I guess it can be a big business thing that they're trying to figure out, right?  Like, how to fine-tune it.  
00:58 00:59 MALE: Ah.  
00:59 01:14 FEMALE: And she told me there was a lot of, like, business types that [unintelligible] events in San Francisco.  They're to, like, young adults, professionals.  And so she was kind of studying that and seeing how to bring it to Stanford.  Because otherwise you have to go to the City to kind of  [unintelligible], you know?  So and that's--
01:13 01:16 MALE: Grad students are lazy.  Driving 40 minutes?  
01:17 01:20 FEMALE: I know.  [laughter]  I don't think so, right?

01:35 01:35 FEMALE: Go and ask--
01:34 01:36 MALE: area of English focus--
01:36 01:57 FEMALE: Oh, yeah, yeah, it's like philosophy and literature.  I'm very interested in, like, the way, um, I don't know, certain, like, ideas of how language works, like, [unintelligible], like Walter Benjamin, Roman, like, [unintelligible], like the linguistics, like, uh, kind of like the way language works to produce effects on people.  So like, poetry, lines in poetry.  I don't really care so much about just, like, regular novels which boring old thoughts like--
01:57 01:58 MALE: Reds?
01:58 02:09 FEMALE: That's not, I mean, that's cool to read but I don't really care to analyze it.  Like, I'm more interested in the ideas behind it, like, how come when you read a certain line of poetry, like, wow, that's really good.  Another one and you're, like, yeah, that sucks.  You know ?  Like, is there a way that--
02:10 02:14 MALE: You know, I'm not familiar with the linguists and [unintelligible] you mentioned, but this kind of a thing they that they study?
02:14 03:00 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  We [unintelligible] Jacobsen [phonetic] talked about how there's, like, two ways to create meaning.  It's like to [unintelligible] this scientific thing of, like, axis.  So one axis is, like, the selection.  What word do you choose?  And the other axis is, like, I think it's like placement, like where do you put it in conjunction to another word.  And like the chief thing is ambiguity.  Like, if something's ambiguous in a good way it makes it a really good [unintelligible], like, [unintelligible] a lot of--if you say something kind of boring and, like, banal, then it's kind of bad [unintelligible].  It's like, you know, a clich'e.  It's like, oh, you know, like all this bad love poetry, like, you know, or the country music songs where it's like, you know, my heart got run over and like now I'm crying a river.  Something like that where it says, I don't know, you know--I can't think of a creative one right now.  But you look at the creative kind of metaphorical ones and you're, like, oh, this moving.  [unintelligible] song lyrics, right?  Like, why are song lyrics--what are the song lyrics [unintelligible].
03:00 03:02 MALE: Do you--do you write any poetry [unintelligible] sometime?  
03:06 03:12 FEMALE: But I try not to [unintelligible] but then I get kind of frozen.  I can't write anything, it's all crap.  
03:12 03:15 MALE: How did you get your--was this something that you did, like, a senior piece as an undergrad?
03:16 03:19 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Well, actually I did--my senior piece is on Gertrude Stein.  I don't know if you know of her.  She's a--
03:20 03:22 MALE: You hear a phrase--I was actually in a bookstore looking [unintelligible]--
03:21 03:23 FEMALE: You know her?  Most people don't know her.

03:25 03:26 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that whole--
03:29 03:33 MALE: But I've always wondered, you know, there's like one book that she wrote that she's really known for and I haven't read it.  
03:34 03:35 FEMALE: Which one is it?  Do you know the title?  
03:35 03:41 MALE: I would know if I heard it because I was just looking at it in Borders, uh, over winter break.  So I was curious about her, um...
03:41 03:43 FEMALE: I wonder if [unintelligible] there's two of them [unintelligible]
03:44 03:47 MALE: Well, I feel like there's so many American title and it's--maybe nonfiction.  
03:49 03:50 FEMALE: The geographical history of America?

04:07 04:12 FEMALE: Oh, definitely.  She's great to read, though.  She's not, like easy read.  
04:12 04:15 MALE: Well, I'll give myself about a month in the sun to relax and then I'll read something challenging.  
04:14 04:15 FEMALE: [laughter] 
04:17 04:17 MALE2: What station is this?
