00:07  00:08	MALE:  Are we supposed to like wait to even introduce ourselves before we hear the horn? 
00:09  00:10	FEMALE:  I'm not sure.  I think we can cheat.
00:11  00:12	MALE:  Probably, why don't we cheat.

00:16  00:18	MALE:  So what do you do around here?
00:19  00:20	FEMALE:  Um, I'm writing my dissertation.
00:21  00:22	MALE:  Nice, that's a pretty good phase to be in.
00:22  00:23	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
00:24  00:25	MALE:  How long does it take you to get to that stage?
00:25  00:26	FEMALE:  This is my fifth year.
00:27  00:28	MALE:  Fifth year, nice.  And what department?
00:29  00:30	FEMALE:  Linguistics.
00:31  00:31	MALE:  Ooo, linguistics.
00:32  00:33	FEMALE:  So I'm writing a page a day.  It's my piece.
00:34  00:34	MALE:  You can actually do that.
00:35  00:35	FEMALE:  Yes.
00:36  00:37	MALE:  Because, that's actually pretty difficult thing to do.
00:38  00:39	FEMALE:  It is.  Some pages are easier than others.
00:41  00:48	MALE:  Oh, okay.  Actually I'm a third year in Slovak language and literature.  So I have sort of a linguistics bias myself too.  I sort of do Slovak linguistics.
00:49  00:50	FEMALE:  Okay.  What languages you work on?
00:51  00:59	MALE:  Russian, Serbia and Serbia-Cretan.  They're sort of a same [horn].  And time to start.
01:00  01:01	FEMALE:  Now we're starting, officially.
01:02  01:03	MALE:  Now we're starting all right.
01:03  01:03	FEMALE:  Hi, I'm female238.
01:04  01:05	MALE:  Hi female238.  How's it going?  male218.
01:05  01:05	FEMALE:  [laughter]
01:06  01:07	MALE:  You like somebody that might study linguistics.  I don't know where that came from.
01:08  01:09	FEMALE:  Yeah, wow you're very perceptive.
01:10  01:13	MALE:  Well thank you.  Comes with me studying Russian.
01:14  01:14	FEMALE:  Right.
01:15  01:24	MALE:  Interesting.  So, wow, you can actually write a page a day, that's pretty cool.  I mean does that [horn] stay on that --
01:25  01:26	FEMALE:  What -- I'm very confused.  But anyway.  
01:26  01:27	MALE:  I think we're starting again.
01:27  01:31	FEMALE:  Okay.  Let's start fresh you know.  So anyway.  Where are you from?
01:32  01:33	MALE:  I'm from Colorado, from Boulder.
01:33  01:33	FEMALE:  No.  Colorado is beautiful.
01:34  01:34	MALE:   Yeah.
01:36  01:38	FEMALE:  I've only been once, I drove through it once, but I loved it and I wanted to go back.
01:39  01:41	MALE:  Nice. Zipping through which side, like upside, bottom side?
01:42  01:45	FEMALE:  We sort of just zipped through, we drove -- we took like two days to drive through.
01:46  01:47	MALE:  Oh nice, that's a good amount of time to spend.
01:47  01:54	FEMALE:  And we went -- I can't remember what the names of the highways were now, but we were not doing the interstate.  So we were doing like the two lane highways all across the country.
01:55  01:57	MALE:  Interesting.  All the way, even through the mountains.
01:58  01:58	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:59  02:00	MALE:  To avoid Highway 70, is a pretty big feat.
02:01  02:04	FEMALE:  Yeah, it was great to -- because we were following like a river through the canyons and stuff and it seemed like a much nicer way to go.
02:06  02:07	MALE:  Did you stop by Boulder at all?
02:08  02:16	FEMALE:  No, we did do any cities.  We went to the continental divide and we went to Salinas -- no Salita.
02:17  02:17	MALE:  Salita?
02:18  02:18	FEMALE:  Salida.
02:21  02:22	MALE:  Yeah, I never know if it's Salita or Salida I don't know.
02:22  02:27	FEMALE:  And the locals kept saying it was Salida which I thought was weird because the Spanish would be Salida.  But you know, so and then --
02:28  02:34	MALE:  That happens all the time with names like Estes Park, well actually no, Estes Park isn't even Spanish.  Anyhow, sorry go on.
02:35  02:36	FEMALE:  We went to Pueblo which was terrible.
02:37  02:40	MALE:  Pueblo, yeah did you go by Mesa Verde, that's a pretty cool place down there.
02:41  02:44	FEMALE:  No, there were a lot of little stupid mining towns and stuff, but anyway where are you from?  Are you from Boulder?
02:45  02:49	MALE:  I'm from Boulder, yeah.  I was born in Denver and the moved up to Boulder.  How about yourself?
02:50  02:50	FEMALE:  Ohio.
02:51  02:52	MALE:  Ohio.  Where in Ohio?
02:52  02:53	FEMALE:  Cincinnati.
02:54  02:57	MALE:  My dad when to grad school at Ohio State so, I've been through there a couple of times.
02:58  03:04	FEMALE:  Yeah, I went to a lot of college parties there when I was young.
03:05  03:06	MALE:  I sort of was doing a drive through myself through Ohio.
03:06  03:07	FEMALE:  Oh really?  Yeah.
03:07  03:08	MALE:  Stopping by various places around there.
03:08  03:15	FEMALE:  Not as probably as pretty as Colorado.  But it's a pretty state it's more rolling farm land and all those things.
03:16  03:21	MALE:  We got plenty of that were I come from too.  What's your topic for your dissertation?  And that's probably a party foul, but I'm really interested in like linguistics.
03:22  04:01	FEMALE:  No.  Um, well I have a background as a teacher.  And I'm actually going to go back to classrooms teaching and doing research in classrooms.  So, but what I was trying to do was sees how what we now about language variation can be used to improve the teaching of writing, basically.  And so, I hi-jacked nine classrooms, language arts curriculum for a quarter and I replaced what they were doing with, um, with some different language variation activities.  So the kids were looking at like regional variation or [unintelligible] variation, um, the school district was the majority African American.  The teachers are mostly white and talk about ethnic language styles.
04:02  04:04	MALE:  Interesting.  So sort of what kind of communication is going on.
04:05  04:05	FEMALE:  Right, yeah, so.
04:06  04:08	MALE:  Mostly with English and the variations with English accents.
04:08  04:13	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah I did all my work in English.  I don't know any other languages, so.
04:14  04:18	MALE:  Well it's an interesting language to do work in.  How long did you teach before you went into linguistics?
04:19  04:21	FEMALE:  Um, a total of four years.  I was kind of off and on with different things.
04:22  04:31	MALE:  I taught English in Moscow for about a year and half which was very interesting.  Especially since we had to teach, speaking of language variation we had to teach British/English.
04:31  04:31	FEMALE:  Right.
04:31  04:43	MALE:  And I never could get quite used to that because there were so many little variations, sometimes especially if you speak with an accent you know the tendency is to correct, even if you heard it from say from a British person you wouldn't have even batted an eye.
04:44  04:44	FEMALE:  Yeah.
04:45  04:49	MALE:  But like places where articles are dropped in British English and they're not in American English.  So all sorts of interesting things that went on with that.
04:50  04:51	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
04:51  04:59	MALE:  One time when I was living there before, my host sister gave me sort of her homework to do.  And I was like English and I only ended up getting a C+ on it.
05:00  05:00	FEMALE:  [laughter]
05:01  05:06	MALE:  Because it was a verb test and I just -- and it sounded you know I put in exactly how I would have said it curricularly.
05:07  05:07	FEMALE:  Right.
05:08  05:09	MALE:  And the teacher gave it a C+ [horn].
05:09  05:10	FEMALE:  So funny. 
05:10  05:11	MALE:  Well, it was nice meeting you, female238.
05:11  05:12	FEMALE:  Yeah, you too.
05:12  05:12	MALE:  All right take care.
05:13  05:16	FEMALE:  All right, nice to meet you.  Am I supposed to get you to fill out our cads or something?
05:17  05:17	MALE:  Oh, I think we move first and then fill it out right?
05:18  05:18	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
05:20  05:21	MALE:  And this is clockwise right?
05:21  05:22	FEMALE:   Yeah that is clockwise.
05:25  05:26	MALE:  Counter-clockwise.   Clockwise.
