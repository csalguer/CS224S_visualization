0:16 0:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, we're all in a line here, so you get a lot of business school students.

0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  Are you in engineering?
0:25 0:25 MALE:  Yeah, I'm an engineer.

0:27 0:28 MALE:  I do like [unintelligible].
0:29 0:32 FEMALE:  Oh, interesting.  You Ph.D. or?
0:32 0:33 MALE:  Ph.D.  yeah.
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  Okay, it was very specific so I was like sounds like more of a Ph.D. type -
0:36 0:37 MALE:  Ph.D. yeah.
0:38 0:40 FEMALE:  Versus I'm an electrical engineer.  
0:42 0:44 MALE:  Yeah, so what kind of stuff do you do [unintelligible] business [unintelligible?
0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  I'm in the non-profit management -
0:46 0:47 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
0:47 0:48 FEMALE: Program there, so.
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
0:49 0:57 FEMALE:  I'm hopefully going to work for a non-profit whenever I get a job [laughter] and um, not make half as much money as the rest of my classmates, but.
0:59 1:02 MALE:  That's the best thing about -- you're going for an MBA, right [unintelligible] right?
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But not me.  [laughter].
1:05 1:07 MALE:  Yeah, but you'll be helping -- you'll be helping the [unintelligible] so.
1:07 1:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, the alumni office is just not going to like me very much.  I won't get a building named after me or anything like that.
1:13 1:17 MALE:  [unintelligible] make it big in the non-profit.
1:17 1:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe not.  So, how much do you have left of your Ph.D.?
1:23 1:26 MALE:  I've been here for like five and a half years, so I'll probably finish in December.
1:28 1:31 FEMALE:  Cool.  Are you excited to finish or you?
1:32 1:33 MALE:  No, yeah.
1:32 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:33 1:35 MALE:  Definitely, I mean, yeah, I'm excited to sort of move on and -
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:36 1:37 MALE:  And different -
1:38 1:42 FEMALE:  So would you be like a professor or what would you -- what do you do?
1:42 1:47 MALE:  Uh, I think I'll -- yeah, no, I'm not gonna be a professor, I'll probably, um, I'm going to look for a post [unintelligible].
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:49 1:53 MALE:  Just get a lot more -- right now I'm sort of [unintelligible] a little more medical.
1:53 1:54 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  So -
1:56 1:57 MALE:  So maybe like [unintelligible].
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  Oh, do you want to stay around here?
2:00 2:05 MALE:  Um, it would be okay.  It seems like I've been here a long time now, now it's really pretty hard to leave.
2:05 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:07 2:10 MALE:  Like -- I mean I like to go snowboarding, you know, I like the weather here.
2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  It's hard to do as many things as you can do here -
2:14 2:15 MALE:  Right.
2:15 2:20 FEMALE: Anywhere else.  You can do the snowboarding but then you can't do the like going to the beach or whatever and yeah, definitely.
2:21 2:26 MALE:  [unintelligible] besides your non-profit business stuff?
2:27 2:29 FEMALE:  Um, I learned how to snowboard when I got here.
2:29 2:30 MALE:  Oh, yeah?
2:30 2:58 FEMALE:  So that right now, I'm still in the falling on my face phase, but um, hopefully I'll have more time.  Actually I feel like I should have so much time to learn all these things, but I actually don't have that much time so I haven't gotten to learn as many things. Like, I've learned how to surf and I learned how to snowboard, but never enough so that I can get used to those things.  So mostly I guess we go to class and then we have parties and we drink wine and I don't know.
2:58 2:59 MALE:  Yeah.
2:59 3:04 FEMALE:  It's a good life, definitely.  While I'm not that happy about having to work again, but.
3:05 3:06 MALE:  You're [unintelligible] graduate?
3:06 3:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I graduate in a month so it's like -
3:08 3:09 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  A little too close for comfort right now.
3:11 3:13 MALE:  You should [unintelligible] or?
3:14 3:17 FEMALE:  No, uh-huh.  I don't want a job that's my problem.
3:18 3:21 MALE:  Are you going to take some time off and relax?
3:21 3:24 FEMALE:  Who know, who knows?  I haven't really decided.  Can't think that far ahead.  [unintelligible] for now.
3:26 3:30 MALE:  Right.  I took [unintelligible] I mean, I'm sure you'll find something.
3:30 3:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So when did you learn to snowboard?  Recently or?
3:35 3:37 MALE:  No, I started in -- I'm from Wyoming, so -
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
3:38 3:45 MALE:  I've [unintelligible] in Wyoming though.  I started in high school and then -- actually I didn't go that much until I moved out here.
3:45 3:46 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:46 3:50 MALE:  Now, I used to live like 45 minutes away, now I'm like three and a half hours away.
3:51 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:51 3:56 MALE:  Somehow I just really got into it when I got here.
3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  Cool.  Where do you like to go?
3:57 3:57 MALE:  I always go to [unintelligible].
3:59 4:04 FEMALE:  Okay.  No, actually we go to Squaw a lot, but I don't know why other then we just do.
4:06 4:07 MALE:  [unintelligible] student passes.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  Yeah, I've heard it's good.
4:10 4:11 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
