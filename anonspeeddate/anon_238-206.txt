00:01  00:01	MALE:  [Yawn] [horn] Hey.
00:03  00:03	FEMALE:  male206?
00:04  00:04	MALE:  Yeah.
00:04  00:04	FEMALE:  female238.
00:05  00:05	MALE:  female238, hi.
00:06  00:06	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
00:07  00:07	MALE:  How are you doing?
00:07  00:08	FEMALE:  Good.
00:08  00:09	MALE:  How are you feeling tonight?
00:09  00:10	FEMALE:  Ah, I'm feeling a little whirl winded at this point.
00:11  00:12	MALE:  Yeah.  I'm trying to get my second ah -- what you call it?
00:13  00:14	FEMALE:  You're second wind?
00:15  00:15	MALE:  Yeah.
00:16  00:18	FEMALE:  They should have coffee for us or tequila or something, you know.
00:19  00:21	MALE:  They should have shots seriously.
00:22  00:23	FEMALE:  It would be a whole different thing.
00:23  00:24	MALE:  They should also give us like a one minute break every ten people.
00:25  00:27	FEMALE:  Yeah, right.
00:28  00:32	MALE:  It's cool.  It's amazing so many people are willing to like to come out for this thing.
00:33  00:33	FEMALE:  Yeah.
00:34  00:36	MALE:  I guess they must have really sending a lot of Spam.
00:37  00:38	FEMALE:  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  I know I think I actually got the invitation from like three different email lists. 
00:39  00:39	MALE:  Yeah, me too.
00:40  00:56	FEMALE:  It was a little out of control.  But, you know I think it's hard to meet people in graduate school.  You know, like you get your little people in your department and other than the rest of the school is this big amorphous mass and it's hard, so.
00:57  00:58	MALE:  Um, what's you're department?
00:58  00:59	FEMALE:  Linguistics.  How about yours?
01:00  01:02	MALE:  Computer science.
01:04  01:05	FEMALE:  Okay, yeah.
01:06  01:09	MALE:  There could be some of that -- I mean there is some of that.  But it doesn't necessarily mean that all computer scientists are going meet other linguists.
01:10  01:25	FEMALE:  No, it's not a complete set like that.  And I really don't talk to any of the computer type linguists very often, because I don't understand what it is that they do.  Um, but --
01:26  01:27	MALE:  What do you do?  Which area?
01:28  01:32	FEMALE:  Um, socio-linguistics, applied socio-linguistics, so um --
01:33  01:35	MALE:   You maybe one of the people that like actually listen to the tape and then --
01:36  01:50	FEMALE:  You know I -- yeah, I would record people, like in fact my friend that I brought we were eyeing these recorders like this is a nice microphone.  Maybe I should snag that.  So, um, -- I've done that.
01:51  01:57	MALE:  So do you have sense of how they're going to use the process -- like have you ever done experiments, like 50 people talking for two hours so you have like 500 or 100 hours?
01:58  02:10	FEMALE:  I think what they would do is -- I think they do some sort of content analysis of the things like topics that are covered.  And I would --
02:11  02:12	MALE:  Like how many conversations are there about this experiment. 
02:13  02:21	FEMALE:  Right, right.  So topics, so yeah you would start coding like people talk about speed dating, people talk about their departments, people talk about their what do you do for fun. 
02:22  02:22	MALE:  Right.
02:23  02:28	FEMALE:  And then I don't know, I might code how many times people laugh throughout the thing or things like that.  And then you would want to correlate it with do they --
02:29  02:32	MALE:  Correlate if they thought they clicked and all those things.
02:33  02:33	FEMALE:  Exactly, yeah.
02:34  02:39	MALE:  Yeah, I mean they could do these things and make it like if you want it to click just laugh like six times and talk about your department and that's like the magic formula.
02:40  02:54	FEMALE:  That's the computer scientist in you, thinking [laughter] thinking ahead.  That's too funny.  If only it worked that way, seriously.  So have you been here long or?
02:55  02:57	MALE:  This is my fifth year at Stanford.  I was here for undergrad.
02:58  02:59	FEMALE:  Okay.  All right.  Oh, so you're doing co-term.
03:00  03:03	MALE:  Basically, yeah.
03:03  03:04	FEMALE:  Okay.  Cool.  
03:07  03:09	MALE:  So, I have one more year after this.
03:10  03:14	FEMALE:  Yeah.  And um, --
03:16  03:17	MALE:  What do you do for fun?
03:17  03:23	FEMALE:  What do I do for fun?  I'm working on my handstand; hope to have that by the end of the year.
03:24  03:25	MALE:  Want to demonstrate it?
03:25  03:49	FEMALE:  No, you know I have skirt on and plus I haven't really mastered it yet, so it's not really that impressive.  And these things look kind of flimsy.  Um, cook a lot, feed people.  I'm very into like trying to be all gourmet, although I don't know how successful I am of it.  And ah, hang out.  Yeah.  Play in my garden.  What about you?
03:50  03:56	MALE:  Um, I like to read, I really like to read.  Um, these days I've been watching a lot of baseball games, just to pass the time.
03:57  03:58	FEMALE:  Oh.  Go Giants. 
04:03  04:04	FEMALE:  They're on quite the streak.
04:05  04:06	MALE:  Are they really?
04:07  04:08	FEMALE: Well you're the one watching all the games. 
04:08  04:09	MALE: I know but I'm not like national. 
04:09  04:15	FEMALE:  I saw the headlines today and it said ten in a row or something.  I don't know anything about baseball.  But, all right.
04:16  04:17	MALE:  Thanks for talking to me.
04:19  04:21	FEMALE:  Enjoy the rest of your evening.  Yeah, it was nice to meet you.
04:22  04:22	MALE:  It was fun.
