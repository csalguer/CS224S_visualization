1:55 2:10 FEMALE: Yeah. I like to travel, I like to read. I'm a tennis player so I spend a lot of time doing that. Just going outside and hiking and running. I'm just being fit really. It's harder to find time to do all of that stuff too once you're working, though.

3:49 4:00 FEMALE: Hack and slay movies but I like hack and slay. I like movies where there are good guys and there are bad guys if it's going to be hack and slay as opposed to oh, I'm not sure why should I kill that person or not. [laughter] And I want to [horn] I go to my job. It's nice to meet you.
