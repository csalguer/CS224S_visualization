2:17 2:26 MALE:  Yeah.  My dad is a microbiologist and [unintelligible] in microbiology so he knows a lot of people who do [unintelligible].  I think fair enough.  Yeah, that's nice.
2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  Okay, where are you from?  [unintelligible].
2:29 2:49 MALE:  I was in Germany for a year or so, but I'm from India originally.  I'm from the north part of India, [unintelligible].  So I'm an engineer by [unintelligible].  I have an engineering and then a [unintelligible] software programmer and then decided to move to Social Sciences so I came for my Masters and then my Ph.D.  So that's that.
2:49 2:50 FEMALE:  Masters here at Stanford?
2:50 2:51 MALE:  Georgia Tech.
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  Oh.
2:52 3:10 MALE:  [unintelligible].  Yeah.  And then this program, there was a new program that I'm in the Ph.D. program.  I'm in the first quarter basically.  So it was an interesting program and interesting people.  And I work with professors in [unintelligible] and so it's a nice place to be in for doing the kind of work that I do at Stanford.
3:11 3:13 FEMALE:  So you say you're in your third year?
3:13 3:13 MALE:  Third year.
3:15 3:18 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]?

3:21 3:21 FEMALE:  Four years.
3:22 3:35 MALE:  But it might take a little longer.  It depends on the committee.  Otherwise I think it's five.  But since I came in with a Masters, I can transfer all my Masters, class work, course work.  That gives you a lot of, that gives you almost a year.
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  That's great.
3:37 3:38 MALE:  Of course work, yeah.
