0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  Just studying.  
0:09 0:10 MALE:  How is school and stuff?  
0:10 0:23 FEMALE:  It's going well.  It's going well.  I've decided to [unintelligible] one semester again where like basically [unintelligible] this time of the semester is--it's the only [unintelligible] where I might get stressed. 
0:24 0:27 MALE:  Where like work is like insane and--
0:27 0:35 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Well, just sort of like our exams start in like two weeks.  So, it's sort of--
0:36 0:37 MALE:  So, you're busy.  Yeah.

0:43 0:47 MALE:  You're the new court lady.  Like I talked to a bunch of people who were doing that.  How did it go?  
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  It went really well actually.  I didn't know--
0:50 0:54 MALE:  [interposing]  It was the case of the eye disease guy, right?  Like, did you win your case, or--
0:53 1:09 FEMALE:  [interposing]  They didn't tell you.  They didn't tell us if we won or not.  They just--you know, they just gave us individual feedback that I'm happy with.  But it was fun.  Like I never thought of my self as somebody who would ever have any interest in litigating at all.  
1:10 1:12 MALE:  Did it kind of awaken something inside of you, uh?  
1:14 1:23 FEMALE:  Well, I don't necessarily think it's what I want to do, but it actually made me feel a little bit more like [unintelligible] about my oral argument skills.  
1:25 1:25 MALE:  Right.  
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  Because I tend to think I'm pretty bad at that.  
1:28 1:37 MALE:  Yeah, I think we talked about this.  Is it a confidence thing, or is it more just sort of like--yeah, it requires a side of you that you're not used to tapping into, or?  
1:37 1:48 FEMALE:  Actually, I'll tell you what it is.  I think it's that I tend not to be very argumentative when I don't know a whole lot about something.  Like, I just won't--I mean I [unintelligible].  
1:50 1:55 MALE:  Which, and a lot of law students candidly are very comfortable with just sort of making assertions like that.  
1:54 2:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, but when I--a different [unintelligible] like when I actually know a lot of the facts, like I knew this situation inside out, and I knew the [unintelligible].  I feel so much more comfortable.  
2:08 2:11 MALE:  Talking, yeah. So, wow then.  It sounds good. 
2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  So, how have you been doing?  
2:12 2:24 MALE:  I'm good.  I've been traveling a lot.  I lived in D.C. for a couple of weeks over spring break, like [unintelligible].  I lived there for a year.  So, I had a bunch of like--I walked past your old building [unintelligible] policy building.  It's still there.
2:23 2:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, I'm the building right next to it.  
2:25 2:40 MALE:  It's still there, right, right.  It was great because I was staying with a friend in Dupont.  And so I was near like all the places [unintelligible] a bunch of friends.  It was nice.  I saw friends from high school, and it was just nice. Like, I really liked being there, and then I was in Chicago like last week for a conference with some friends.  
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:41 2:55 MALE:  And so I've just been on planes a lot.  I'm just glad to sort of be back like feeling [unintelligible].  I have to go to this wedding like in the next two weeks or something like back in New York.  So, I'm just kind of like--I just want to like sleep in on a weekend and not have to like get up for a flight.  
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:56 3:34 MALE:  But I know [unintelligible], which is [unintelligible].  But it's like all the [unintelligible] time now to like--let's view on page 43.  And I'm like, uh.  I think you go to Sanford.  You should like [crosstalk].  I know.  I know.  I think that [unintelligible] either helpful [unintelligible] skills and stuff.  But my coach he is like I don't respond to e-mails.  I don't know why you're responding to this.  I'm like I can't do that.  No, it's like I'm happy.  I'm trying to get money to go to do research in Germany next year.  So, I'm just waiting to get some people and like--it's good.  It's pretty relaxing.  Like, I don't know.  I don't think [unintelligible] is nice.  So, I'm auditing some, and it's good.  Like--
3:34 3:36 FEMALE:  [interposing]  So, you're teaching and--
3:38 3:39 MALE:  [interposing]  [unintelligible] so that was the big thing like when I was there. 
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Oh, roller-blading? 
3:40 3:49 MALE:  Yeah, no it's huge because now like I go actually like with friends.  It was just nice to be outside, which is [unintelligible] sort of like take a nap or something outside.  
3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  Where do you guys rollerblade?  
3:52 4:00 MALE:  We're like all around campus like up and down Sailor Street where there's no traffic and then kind of behind the bookstore and kind of like near the sculpture gardens and stuff.  
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  It's nice.  
4:01 4:11 MALE: Like, the weekends there's no traffic there.  Like, I don't know if [unintelligible], but my friend is a really [unintelligible] roller blader.  So, he said this campus is one of the best to do it in. I was really afraid of falling down.  
4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  I guess that's nice [unintelligible].  
4:12 4:18 MALE:  Yeah, that's the  main thing.  I should tell him that.  It was nice seeing you, female136.
