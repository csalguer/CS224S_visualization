0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  I'm getting [unintelligible].
0:06 0:08 MALE:  No, you're not.  They're just--they're just cheating on the time.  
0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  Oh, my god.  This is not getting any easier.  
0:14 0:27 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, last time I spent the first 30 seconds figuring out what happened to my card cause I can't spell the alphabet apparently.  
0:07 0:09 FEMALE:  Uh-oh, I apologize.  
0:30 0:30 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].
0:11 0:17 FEMALE:  Hi, nice to meet you.  I'm female129.  This is like, ah, I can't believe we're [unintelligible] five.  I feel like I'm--
0:37 0:40 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, yeah, I'm getting pretty exhausted too.  
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  It's lot of people.  
0:42 0:43 MALE:  Yeah, it certainly is.  
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  Are you having fun?
0:45 0:46 MALE:  Yeah, I guess so.  Are you?
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  That was sort of ambivalent.  
0:47 0:47 MALE:  Yeah. 
0:28 0:29 FEMALE:  Like you might as well do it, huh?  
0:50 0:50 MALE:  Yeah.
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  What program are you in?
0:51 0:53 MALE:  Doing [unintelligible].  What about you?
0:33 0:36 FEMALE:  There's somebody else floating around [unintelligible].
0:57 1:00 MALE:  Oh, I don't know anyone here, but everyone that I meet at Stanford is studying P.S.
0:40 0:42 FEMALE:  How many P.S. people are there?
1:02 1:05 MALE:  Oh, a lot.  It's like 300 [unintelligible].  
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  Three hundred.  
1:07 1:09 MALE:  They accepted 100 just this last year.  
0:49 1:04 FEMALE: This is like my--tonight is like my education in the Stanford grad program because I'm in [unintelligible].  My particular program has 17 people in it.  So, we're into like small things here and all of the sudden I learned there are 800 electrical engineers in one.  That's massive.  
1:24 1:26 MALE:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, engineers there's a lot of them.  
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, so are you Master's or PhD?
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Master's. 
1:10 1:10 FEMALE:  First year?
1:30 1:30 MALE:  Yep.
1:11 1:12 FEMALE:  One year, two years?
1:33 1:34 MALE:  Maybe three.  
1:14 1:20 FEMALE:  Three?  Three years to get a Master's?  [unintelligible] to do it.
1:40 1:41 MALE:  I didn't study CS for undergrad.
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  Okay, what did you study?
1:43 1:43 MALE:  English. 
1:25 1:27 FEMALE:  It's a good switch, a little liberal arts.  
1:48 1:48 MALE: Yeah.
1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  So, why B.S.?
1:51 1:59 MALE:  I don't know.  I got really sick of English.  [unintelligible] deals with like languages a lot.  
1:39 1:39 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:00 2:04 MALE:  Like computer languages and such.  I don't know.  It seemed interesting to me.  
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  Okay, so what were you doing in between undergrad and [unintelligible]?  
2:07 2:09 MALE:  I just came.  I didn't do anything.  
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  You're young then, huh?
2:10 2:13 MALE:  I am.  No, I don't know.  How young do you think I am?
1:53 1:54 FEMALE:  22?
2:14 2:14 MALE:  No.
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  23?
2:16 2:17 MALE: Yeah, I'll be 24 soon.  
1:57 2:06 FEMALE:  Okay, so--yeah, just a little bit.  A little bit--just to be [unintelligible] go straight from undergrad to graduate school.  
2:26 2:26 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:07 2:10 FEMALE:  You can do what you want [unintelligible] with yourself.  It took some of us a little bit longer.  
2:30 2:32 MALE:  No, it's more like I'm afraid to get a job.  
2:12 2:16 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  There's that, or--hey, I like being [unintelligible] quit now?  
2:36 2:38 MALE:  Yeah, so what's your--what year are you in?  
2:19 2:25 FEMALE:  I am in my first and only year, which makes me [unintelligible].  
2:43 2:43 MALE:  Ah.  
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  It's a quick nine-months master's in education [unintelligible].  
2:48 2:49 MALE:  So, you worked for a while in between?  
2:29 2:30 FEMALE:  I did.  I taught second grade.  
2:51 2:51 MALE:  Oh, cool.  
2:33 2:33 FEMALE:  Great job.  
2:54 2:54 MALE:  Did you go to college in Boston?  
2:35 2:36 FEMALE:  I went to college in New Hampshire.  
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Huh.  
2:38 2:40 FEMALE:  A really funny place.  
3:00 3:01 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:40 2:50 FEMALE:  So, it was an easy move to, you know, leave the woods of New Hampshire and move close to the city.  So, it was great. 
3:10 3:12 MALE:  So, is the west totally different from the northeast?
2:57 2:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, we adjust.  It's much different.  I miss New England a lot actually.  
3:18 3:18 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:58 3:02 FEMALE:  I mean it's hard not to like the place that's idyllic.  
3:23 3:27 MALE:  Actually it's not even that idyllic.  There are so many roads.  It's so paved and built up.  
3:07 3:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, but it's so easy to find places that aren't.  I mean we're so close to--
3:32 3:34 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, yeah, there's like the wildlife reservation in Freemont.  
3:15 3:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, that all the [unintelligible] skylines.  You head out like even go on [unintelligible] and just keep going.  There are like eight state parks that are all or [unintelligible] land reservations that are all like right up against each other.  
3:52 3:53 MALE:  Yeah, there's a lot of--
3:33 3:36 FEMALE:  [interposing]  A huge chunk of land that's pretty empty.  
3:56 4:05 MALE:  Yeah, but then like if you're trying to drive to the city you have to sit in traffic for hours and that kind of--that kind of thing is horrible.  
3:45 3:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, I commuted 70 miles a day for three years so that--
4:09 4:10 MALE:  It doesn't bother you?
3:50 3:54 FEMALE:  Not really especially on 280, which is a pretty highway.
4:15 4:18 MALE:  Yeah, 280 is way better than 10 whatever.  Was that the bell?  
3:58 3:59 FEMALE:  That was the bell.
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Have fun, it was nice to meet you.  
4:21 4:21 MALE: You too.
