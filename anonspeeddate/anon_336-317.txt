0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  [laughter].

0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  male317, nice to meet you.

0:24 0:27 MALE:  And where do you, uh, hale from--what is your major?

0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  I'm studying medicine, I'm a medical student.

0:29 0:34 MALE:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Cool.  And so, um, what year are you?

0:34 0:34 FEMALE:  I'm a second year.

0:35 0:38 MALE:  Second year.  Okay.  Are you going on for a specialization?

0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, probably.

0:40 0:41 MALE:  What--what are you interested in?

0:41 0:52 FEMALE:  I don't know, but I'm--I'm looking at emergency medicine, oncology, pulmonary medicine, and I'm keeping an open mind because I'm just enjoying [unintelligible] next year, so I'll get to rotate and see what [unintelligible].

0:52 0:56 MALE:  So you must handle stress very well.  [laughter].  Emergency medicine, my God.

0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  When people say that I'm like--

0:57 0:58 MALE:  [laughter].  Oh, God, it's just 

0:58 1:17 FEMALE:  Well, the thing is--okay.  But when you--well--well, when I was there doing rotation there's only a couple of traumas.  But there's more--20 other people who just come in for a stitch or maybe they're having a heart attack.  But it's not something that you have to--you know, that whole image of reviving someone is just so rare even saying so.

1:17 1:23 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Well if you want to really high stress I think--the highest stress place I've ever seen is the preemie ward. 

1:23 1:25 FEMALE:  Oh, really.  Yeah.  Yeah.

1:24 1:25 MALE:  Any--these babies are in bad shape, right.  

1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:25 1:29 MALE:  I mean, one pounds, two pounds, and you keep hearing the heart monitor going off and everything like that, you know.

1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  That would be pretty, uh--

1:30 1:32 MALE:  God, it's just terrible.  I [unintelligible].  [laughter].

1:32 1:37 FEMALE:  You know what I've heard though is--is worse I--uh, anesthesiology 'cause it's really boring.

1:38 1:38 MALE:  Yeah.

1:38 1:44 FEMALE:  When--for most of the time--for 99 percent of the time.  And one of the time--and one percent of the time it's traumatic because it goes--all hell goes loose and--

1:44 1:45 MALE:  That's right.

1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  And I don't think I'd want that.

1:47 1:48 MALE:  Don't want that [unintelligible].  [laughter].

1:48 1:56 FEMALE:  [laughter].  I don't know, maybe--maybe it would be too stressful for me.  I--I never thought of it as stressful, I think of it more as exciting.  But who knows.  Yeah.

1:57 2:00 MALE:  That's cool, my dad, he's a doctor.  He's a thoracic surgeon.

2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:01 2:01 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.

2:01 2:03 FEMALE:  Wow, that's pretty intense too.

2:04 2:04 MALE:  Yeah.  It's very--it's very intense.

2:05 2:07 FEMALE:  Did he have a lot of calls where he had to like...?

2:07 2:11 MALE:  Yeah, he was on call all the time and he had all sorts of big things.  He had this picture of the biggest tumor you ever seen.  It [unintelligible] looking. 

2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  Oh, my God.

2:14 2:21 MALE:  It was like 30 pounds or something, it was really gross.  You know the thing is that the person didn't even know she had it in her.  I don't know how you can walk around with a 30-pound tumor.

2:21 2:22 FEMALE:  You know the biggest tumor they found?

2:22 2:23 MALE:  What?  [laughter].

2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Three hundred pounds.

2:24 2:25 MALE:  Oh, God.  Yeah.

2:25 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:25 2:26 MALE:  You got to wonder are these people like out of touch with their bodies.

2:26 2:31 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Yeah.  [laughter].

2:31 2:33 MALE:  [unintelligible].  [laughter].

2:33 2:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:34 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, I'll just put this other part of you here.

2:37 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, like there's a 300-pound blob in your body.  I mean, can you imagine how much a person--yeah.

2:41 2:47 MALE:  Yeah, you wonder how much that person weighs [unintelligible] seven hundred pounds.  Oh, I guess when you get that heavy you just don't walk, so you don't notice that's wrong everything feels wrong. 

2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Yeah.  

2:49 2:49 MALE:  So, uh--yeah.

2:49 2:51 FEMALE:  What do you study?  FEMALE:  What are your--what are your interests?

2:51 2:52 MALE:  Electrical engineering and computer architecture.

2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  Um-hum.  Architecture?

2:54 3:10 MALE:  Computer architecture.  Yeah, it's called--it's the in which you design the computer system so it can run really fast, you know.  So, uh, you know, you like--right now there's this big thing about taking multiple processors and put them on the same chip and have them work much faster.  We look at stuff like that.

3:10 3:11 FEMALE:  Super computing and all that?

3:11 3:17 MALE:  Yeah.  That kind of stuff.  It's fun. I get to work from home mostly.  Mr. Big Pro.

3:17 3:18 FEMALE:  Oh, it must be really nice.

3:19 3:19 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

3:19 3:20 FEMALE:  Or from the beach if you really--

3:21 3:22 MALE:  Yup.

3:22 3:23 FEMALE:  --wanted to I guess.

3:23 3:31 MALE:  So, that's [unintelligible] so I can log in from my modem, my cell phone.  I'd just, you know, hang out at the beach and do your programming.

3:31 3:33 FEMALE:  That's sweet.  That's sweet.

3:33 3:38 MALE:  Yeah.  I like--yeah, I like having a lot of freedom so.  And I work too, I work at HP labs [unintelligible].

3:39 3:41 FEMALE:  Um-hum, like part-time, I'm--I'm assuming, right?

3:41 3:42 MALE:  Yeah, half time.  Yeah half time.

3:42 3:44 FEMALE:  It must be tough to juggle.

3:45 4:03 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  There's been a lot of--a lot of stuff to do.  But--but, yeah, like I said, I like to kind of have multiple things going because then if you just do one thing I tend to kind of finally--it gets to be dull you know.  So at HP labs I actually worked on something completely unconnected to what I do for my business [unintelligible].

4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  That's nice.

4:04 4:05 MALE:  I work in strategy for [unintelligible].

4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Like business strategy or...?

4:07 4:08 MALE:  Uh-huh.  

4:08 4:09 FEMALE:  Oh, that's totally different.

4:09 4:10 MALE:  Research strategy.

4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  It must be, yeah.  That's good.

4:12 4:13 MALE:  It's fun, yeah.

4:14 4:17 FEMALE:  And what else do you do on your free time and what do you like to do?

4:17 4:29 MALE:  Well, I like to do like, um, basically hang out with friends and go for--the movies and things like that and also see things I've never seen before, I like to do--I like to meet people who are very different from myself.

4:29 4:29 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

4:30 4:36 MALE:  And then hang out and do what they do just so I can see what it's like to be different, you know.  So, I do a lot of that.

4:36 4:37 FEMALE:  Um-hum, like what?

4:38 4:41 MALE:  Oh, I couldn't begin to tell you.

4:41 4:42 FEMALE:  [laughter].

4:42 4:44 MALE:  If we had more time I'd tell you.

4:44 4:44 FEMALE:  All right.

4:45 4:45 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.

4:45 4:47 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  Take care.
