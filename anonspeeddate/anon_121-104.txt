0:00 0:02 FEMALE: It's really loud.  [laughter]  

0:04 0:11 MALE: It's really bad.  You're A?  Is that right?

0:09 0:10 FEMALE: I am A.

0:12 0:13 MALE: I'm sure they probably figure it out.

0:11 0:14 FEMALE: You turn the corner.  I think a lot of people are supposed to be-

0:16 0:16 MALE: Yeah. 

0:15 0:17 FEMALE: I'll have to let them know there's some confusion but--

0:20 0:22 MALE: I didn't like that loud noise from back there.  Really bad.

0:20 0:24 FEMALE: No, really, and they seem to grow up more every time so--  [laughter]  I'm female121.

0:26 0:28 MALE: I don't know if they had problems before.  I'm male104.

0:26 0:30 FEMALE: Hi.  [laughter]  Um, are you having fun?

0:32 0:33 MALE: Um--

0:32 0:33 FEMALE: Are you getting there?  [laughter] 

0:35 0:38 MALE: I'm doing okay.  I'm not having a bad time.

0:36 0:44 FEMALE: Yeah, fair enough.  It's getting to be a lot.  I'm just starting to get--like I'm starting to get tired.  The conversation's are starting to repeat themselves a little bit.

0:46 0:49 MALE: Yeah, actually I think my conversation is getting better.

0:47 0:48 FEMALE: Good.

0:50 0:50 MALE: Yeah.

0:49 0:50 FEMALE: Because you're more relaxed?

0:52 0:59 MALE: Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe I've become sort of glazed over so I have less [unintelligible] I am being less judgmental about it.

0:57 0:59 FEMALE: I'm sure.  It's a lot of people.

1:02 1:02 MALE: Yeah.

1:00 1:04 FEMALE: In a very fast time.  Yeah.  Have you ever done anything like this before?

1:07 1:07 MALE: No.

1:05 1:06 FEMALE: Me neither.

1:08 1:09 MALE: Are you going to again?

1:07 1:07 FEMALE: I doubt it.  [laughter] 

1:11 1:11 MALE: Yeah.

1:09 1:13 FEMALE: I don't want to say it.  I'm taking Professor nameX's class this quarter, so--

1:15 1:15 MALE: Okay.

1:13 1:15 FEMALE: He handed out the forms in class so it was--

1:17 1:19 MALE: It's like, it's like you must do this.

1:17 1:27 FEMALE: It wasn't like you must do this but it was [laughter] a lot of them caused chatter about it.  A lot of chatter.  What program are you in?

1:29 1:30 MALE: Computer science.

1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Excellent.

1:32 1:32 MALE: Not really.

1:31 1:31 FEMALE: No it is.

1:33 1:35 MALE: It's really not.  It's horrible.

1:33 1:33 FEMALE: Why?

1:36 1:37 MALE: I'm philosophically opposed to computers.

1:36 1:38 FEMALE: Then why [laughter] the computer science program?

1:39 1:40 MALE: Yeah, I don't know.

1:39 1:41 FEMALE: [laughter]  Are you getting a masters or a doctorate?

1:44 1:44 MALE: Masters.

1:42 1:48 FEMALE: Thank you.  If you said a doctorate I would say you really need to get out right now. [laughter] 

1:48 1:48 MALE: Yeah.

1:49 1:50 FEMALE: Why don't you like it?

1:52 1:55 MALE: No, I like it, I like to complain about it.  I don't like computers.  

1:51 1:51 FEMALE: You don't like computers?

1:56 1:58 MALE: I don't at all.  I studied English undergrad.

1:57 2:03 FEMALE: Are you trying to make them into something that you like?  Is that part of your goal here or no?  You're trying to get over your dislike of them?

2:06 2:12 MALE: No, neither of those.  I don't know what I'm doing here.  I was afraid to get a job so--

2:11 2:13 FEMALE: So you came to Stanford in computer science?

2:15 2:18 MALE: Yeah, I love being a student.  I just don't want to get a real job.

2:16 2:19 FEMALE: Yeah.  How did you parlay an English undergrad into computer science?

2:23 2:25 MALE: You know, I really don't know.  I don't know how I pulled that one off.

2:23 2:25 FEMALE: That's a good trick actually.  Excellent.

2:27 2:28 MALE: What about you?  What are your plans?

2:27 2:38 FEMALE: Um, I'm in a one year masters program so we--actually I'm done in June and I'm hoping to stay in the Bay Area but beyond that unfortunately it's not as specific as I would like.  [laughter] 

2:40 2:41 MALE: Do some teaching?

2:39 2:52 FEMALE:  Something.  It's actually not a teaching program.  There is a teaching program here but I'm in a policy and leadership program so I'm better prepared to work like in a district office and do support of schools.  Not in a classroom but--

2:55 2:59 MALE:  So like um, deciding rules that they have?

2:58 3:06 FEMALE: And helping them put programs in place and make sure that they are running the schools properly in terms of like budgets and all that kind of stuff.

3:07 3:09 MALE: Make sure Arnold isn't taking away all the money?

3:08 3:10 FEMALE: To late.  Unfortunately I can't do anything about that.

3:12 3:13 MALE: Yeah, Arnold sucks.

3:11 3:18 FEMALE: It's more like he's going to take away the money.  Okay, now we have to do more with less money so how do we do it more efficiently.

3:21 3:21 MALE: Yeah.

3:19 3:21 FEMALE: That's what I'll be figuring out.

3:24 3:29 MALE: Every time you turn on the TV there's people pissed off at Arnold for taking away money from schools.  Yeah he--

3:29 3:32 FEMALE: They're right to be pissed.  People here are really pissed.

3:34 3:35 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah, hate that guy.

3:32 3:38 FEMALE: Mm hmm. [laughter]  He does plenty that warrants your hatred, I think.

3:40 3:42 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah, bad movies.

3:41 3:42 FEMALE: Yeah, exactly.  The Terminator.

3:45 3:47 MALE: Yeah. Terminator II was pretty good also.

3:45 3:50 FEMALE: It was pretty good.  Because like, the bad guy was so good.  I didn't see the third one with the woman.

3:53 3:58 MALE: Yeah, I haven't seen that many of those, of those Terminator, of those Arnold Schwarzenegger movies.  Yeah, he has a few good ones. [horn]

4:00 4:01 FEMALE: It is so--was nice meeting you.  [laughter] 

4:03 4:05 MALE: Yeah you too.  Good luck with the--with the noise. 
 
4:02 4:02 FEMALE: Have fun.

4:05 4:06 MALE: Don't go deaf or anything.

4:03 4:07 FEMALE: Thank you.  Too late.  It's going to happen I think.
