00:43  	00:44  	MALE:  Oh [laughter] okay.

00:44  	00:45  	FEMALE:  So we have to write our research thesis over the summer.

00:45	00:46  	MALE:  Uh-oh, that's a challenge.

00:46	00:47  	FEMALE:   It's sort of [unintelligible].

00:47	00:51  	MALE:  [laughter] look at the cap and gown and go right back to work.

00:51	00:52  	FEMALE:  Exactly.  So how about you.  What are you studying?

00:53	00:53  	MALE:  I'm in Political Science. 

00:54  	00:54  	FEMALE:  Okay.

00:55	01:06  	MALE:  I'm in the doctorate program.  I'm in my third year now.  Yeah, it's nice I really like it.  I think I like -- at the third year you've got other classes and stuff and you're like wait a second.  I have all this free time what is there to do with it.  Oh write a paper, right.

01:06  	01:07  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  Yes.

01:08  	01:10  	MALE:   So do you like the program overall?

01:10  	01:14  	FEMALE:  I love it.  I love -- I just love being out here.  It's beautiful.

01:14  	01:15  	MALE:  Are you from California?

01:15  	01:16  	FEMALE:  From the east coast.

01:17  	01:17  	MALE:  Where in the east coast.

01:17  	01:27  	FEMALE:  Rochester New York originally.  Um, but I went to school in, um, -- I went to Williams [unintelligible] and then lived in Boston for a couple of years.

01:27  	01:29  	MALE:  Right.  So this is a kind of a cultural and weather wise

01:29  	01:30  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

01:30  	01:31  	MALE:  Yeah, I'm from Michigan, so --

01:31  	01:33  	FEMALE:  Okay, so you know cold --

01:34  	01:35  	MALE:  Cold Michigan winters.  Yes.

01:34  	01:36  	FEMALE:  Yes, like the first snow and all that good stuff.

01:36  	01:46  	MALE:  Like -- oh yeah, like snow days like wouldn't exist here.  You know what, before I came here I'm kind of like weather doesn't make that big of a difference, like you can adjust to weather.  But I'm now I'm thinking [unintelligible] it's like --

01:46  	01:49  	FEMALE:  No it does.  Yeah.  I lived in Costa Rica for a year and --

01:49  	01:50  	MALE:  Oh, wow.

01:50  	01:52  	FEMALE:  And the thing I really learned weather makes a difference.

01:52  	01:54  	MALE:  Yeah, what -- when were you in Costa Rica, right before you came here or?

01:55  	02:03  	FEMALE:  Um, no, it was actually it was like a year and half before I graduated from College and a couple of years before I came here so you can do the math [unintelligible].

02:05  	02:06  	MALE:  Right.  That's good, no.  So what were you doing in Costa Rica?

02:06  	02:11  	FEMALE:  I was teaching English in two very rural public schools.

02:11  	02:13  	MALE:  Wow.  That sounds like exciting and like that.

02:14  	02:15  	FEMALE:  Yeah it was really cool.

02:15  	02:18  	MALE:  Was it difficult to -- like had you -- did you speak Spanish beforehand?

02:18  	02:26  	FEMALE:  Um, I spoke enough to get by, beforehand.  Um, but I definitely improved -- had to improve rapidly in order to deal with my students [laughter].

02:26  	02:30  	MALE:  Right.  Well what made you decide to leave Costa Rica and do something else?

02:30  	02:32  	FEMALE:  Um, it was a one year program, so -- a volunteer teaching program.  

02:32  	02:33  	MALE:  Right.

02:34  	02:42  	FEMALE:  Actually, it was actually really hard to sit and debating on whether to stay for another year or to come back and work.  But ultimately financially it was not really --

02:42  	02:45  	MALE:  [unintelligible] someplace like afterwards then?

02:45  	02:51  	FEMALE:  Um, I done a lot of work in schools in the U.S. not teaching.  I've done a lot like college counseling and things like that.

02:51  	02:56  	MALE:  Oh, cool.  And now do you know what you want to do after finish -- or hand in that thesis?

02:57  	03:02  	FEMALE:  Hopefully, education research, we'll see.  If they give me a job [laughter].

03:02  	03:06  	MALE:  Right [laughter].  That seems to be a common concern among Ed students that I've met, -- sort of like --

03:06  	03:06  	FEMALE:  Well, I just mean --

03:07  	03:09  	MALE:  Just a weird time, that weird crunch time now.

03:10  	03:13  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  You've got a couple more years before you have to think about that I guess.

03:13  	03:46  	MALE:  Yeah, I'm [unintelligible] where this dissertation is just sort of random like blog that -- someday I'll have one, I don't know what it will look like, but I'll have one -- someday I'll leave this program.  But I'm not like particularly -- if the funding department [unintelligible] good or bad, because you feel this pressure like I've got to get out because they won't support me.  On the other hand it's kind of like, ah, it's comfortable, you know you wake up in the morning and it's sunny and you have work and stuff.  And -- but um, like I'm looking forward to teaching someday.  I mean like not as a TA, but like I would like -- I like teaching [unintelligible] is really fun.  So, it's a plan anyway I don't know if it will actually work.

03:47  	03:47  	FEMALE:  Teaching is fun.

03:49  	03:53  	MALE:  Yeah, I mean the thing is like I -- my sister is a teacher in Arkansas now.  And she --

03:53  	03:54  	FEMALE:  Is she in -- teach for America

03:54  	03:55  	MALE:  She teaches for America, yeah.

03:55  	03:56  	FEMALE:  [laughter] [unintelligible] teaching art and science.

03:57  	04:03  	MALE:  Yeah, it's funny she really -- she wanted to be placed in the south.  I don't think she realized it would be such a cultural shock for her.

04:03  	04:04  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  

04:04  	04:05  	MALE:  [unintelligible].  

04:05  	04:11  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  It was really nice to meet you.

04:11  	04:12  	MALE:  Well, it was nice to meet you, female125

04:12  	04:12  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

04:13  	04:13  	MALE:  Take care.

04:13  	04:14  	FEMALE:  Have a nice night.

04:15  	04:15  	MALE:  We'll try.
