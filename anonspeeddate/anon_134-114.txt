0:35 0:38 MALE:  All right, okay.  That's where my great parents lived, actually.  
0:38 0:43 FEMALE:  Oh, really?  So, did you go to college in the U.S., or did you just come over for [unintelligible]?  
0:43 0:48 MALE:  I did my undergrad in Moscow, and then Master's in England, and I came over here for [unintelligible].  
0:48 0:52 FEMALE:  Oh, wow, wow.  So, how many years have you been here?  
0:52 0:54 MALE:  Since September.  So, it's like half a year.  
0:55 0:57 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah.  What do you think? Do you like California?  
0:57 0:58 MALE:  Yeah, so much, yeah.  
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?  
0:59 1:01 MALE:  The weather is great, yeah, and I like the people.  
1:01 1:01 FEMALE: Yeah?  
1:01 1:08 MALE: Laid back, relaxed. I went a couple of times before to the East Coast, like Long Island and New York City.  
1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:09 1:11 MALE:  Yeah, it was kind of different, but also interesting.  
1:12 1:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's really different.  What did you think about there?  
1:15 1:17 MALE:  Well, I liked it.  I like [unintelligible].  I had good times.  
1:17 1:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:17 1:19 MALE:  I stayed with a close family.  So...
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah. 
1:20 1:21 MALE:  It was a lot of fun.  
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:22 1:23 MALE:  What about you?  Where did you grow up?  
1:24 1:26 FEMALE:  I grew up in North Carolina in the south.  
1:27 1:27 MALE:  Right, so--
1:27 1:31 FEMALE:  [interposing]  And then I lived in DC after college.  I've been out of college for a few years.  
1:31 1:31 MALE:  Right.  
1:32 1:37 FEMALE:  I was a teacher there.  But I never lived on the West Coast before.  I just came here this year.  
1:38 1:39 MALE:  Okay, out of three?  
1:40 1:42 MALE:  Yeah, out of three.  How about you?  How long is yours?  
1:42 1:43 MALE:  I think around five.  
1:45 1:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, like you know what your focus is for your study?  
1:48 1:53 MALE:  More or less, either economic sociology or inequality [unintelligible], things like that.  
1:53 1:57 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  Are you spending it in America or in Russia?   
1:58 2:09 MALE:  I haven't decided yet.  I can't decide.  Previously I've written on Russia and England.  So, now it will be interesting to kind of write on and do, yes, I guess so.  
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:10 2:13 MALE:  What are your plans for after you are finished with your degree?  2:14 2:18 FEMALE: I don't know, I mean I'm definitely going to be a lawyer either here or DC.  
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Right, right, right.  
2:20 2:27 FEMALE:  I'm  not exactly sure what kind of work I want to do.  I like like trial law and [unintelligible] work.  
2:28 2:28 MALE:  Right, right, right.  
2:29 2:39 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I mean it's open.  This summer I'm working in DC and working with like juveniles, teenagers who have been accused of things.  Yeah.  
2:40 2:41 MALE:  So you're going to defend them in court?  
2:41 2:53 FEMALE:  So, yeah.  What's Russia like right now?  Like how's the politics?  Like is [unintelligible] going to stay in power or what?  
2:54 3:07 MALE:  Well, I think he's doing a lot of good things for Russia although he is doing it by centralizing power.  But I don't think it's necessarily a kind of bad approach.  So, I think Russia needs some of the things right now.  
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:08 3:14 MALE:  And he is pretty popular.  His ranking like--rating never falls below I think 70% or something.  
3:15 3:16 FEMALE:  Do you think people really like him?  
3:16 3:17 MALE: Yeah, absolutely.  
3:17 3:18 FEMALE:  You like him? 
3:19 3:20 MALE:  I do, yeah, yeah.  
3:21 3:22 FEMALE:  So what about [unintelligible]?  What's going on with that?  
3:23 3:30 MALE:  Well, now I think it's like they are trying to kind of control peace there, but it's not, you know, very easy.  
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:33 3:36 MALE:  Because it's a very kind of difficult region.  
3:37 3:37 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:38 3:43 MALE: Muslims, and they had this difficult relationship with Russia for like hundreds of years, so--
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
3:44 3:50 MALE:  It's going to take time, but now it is much more peaceful now that like even two years before.  
3:50 3:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, so you think that will give the economy a pretty stabilized [unintelligible]?  
3:55 3:58 MALE:  I don't think it's stabilized, but it's growing faster.  
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  And better? 
3:59 4:02 MALE: Yeah, it's a good sign.  It's growing really fast, so--
4:03 4:05 FEMALE:  What about? Like when is he up for re-election?  
4:07 4:08 MALE:  2008 I think.  
4:08 4:12 FEMALE: Oh, not until 2008?  Wow, how long are the terms?  
4:12 4:13 MALE:  Four years.  Four years.  
4:14 4:18 FEMALE:  Oh, so he was just re-elected, yeah, yeah.  
4:18 4:21 MALE:  What about like all the poison he [unintelligible] in Ukraine and stuff?  
4:22 4:26 FEMALE:  That was just vile stories?  How so?
