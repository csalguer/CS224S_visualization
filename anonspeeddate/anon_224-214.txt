0:54 0:55 MALE:  What kind of, what kind of shows do you watch? 
0:56 1:03 FEMALE:  I love um, I really like [laughter] Desperate Housewives because it's sort of like a Sex In The City substitute.  
1:04 1:04 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:05 1:12 FEMALE:  Not as good as Sex In The City, because I lived in New York for four years before I came here.  Um, and uh, I really sort of the crime shows, so have you seen the show Numbers?

1:25 1:25 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:25 1:29 FEMALE:   Um, and then there's some reality, and I like CSI: Miami, which I think is much better then regular CSI.  
1:30 1:30 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:31 1:36 FEMALE:  [laughter] And um, then I also like some reality shows.  But I'm sort of all over the map.

1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  At the engineering school? 
1:42 1:42 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, a lot of MBA students take that.  
1:44 1:48 MALE:  No I know, and they all seem so energetic and then there's always something going on. 
1:49 1:49 FEMALE:  Right, right, right. Yeah.  
1:50 1:51 MALE:  I was going to join Test Masters.  
1:52 1:52 FEMALE:  Test Masters?  
1:53 1:54 MALE:  Yeah, it's like a speaking club.
1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:55 2:00 MALE:  And you just get to practice, and it's in S-something, it's like on the bottom floor, S2, S7, it's one of those.

2:06 2:06 MALE:  I recommend it.  I learned a lot.  
2:07 2:07 FEMALE:  Because it forces you to--
2:08 2:08 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  --talk in every class. 
2:10 2:12 MALE:  Right. I thought it was a bad public speaker but then after taking the class--
2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  You're like--
2:13 2:14 MALE:  --I felt a lot better.  
2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  What was your final project about?  
2:17 2:19 MALE:  It was about rocket science because I'm in aerospace.  
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  Is that what you study? 
2:21 2:23 MALE:  And, and I want to do rockets.  
2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  Were you studying about the X-Pride?  
2:25 2:26 MALE:  Yeah, very.  
2:27 2:27 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:27 2:28 MALE:  That's, that's what opened up the job market for me.  
2:29 2:29 FEMALE:  Really? 
2:30 2:32 MALE:  So I get to, I have a better chance of doing what I want to do.  
2:33 2:35 FEMALE:  So are you sort of in the early days of your program or? 
2:36 2:43 MALE:  Well, I, I, just finished the Masters in mechanical engineering, and I'm going to do a second degree in aerospace.  And then actually in the future, I was going to do an MBA, but not yet.  I'm probably going to do that while I work. 
2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  Wow, so you're going to be a permanent student.  [laughter] 
2:47 2:49 MALE:  Well my dad has four degrees and I want four degrees too.

2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:53 2:55 MALE:  I don't want to beat him, I don't want to make him jealous.  
2:56 2:58 FEMALE:  That's, that's fair.  But you could do like some certificate program and just like--
2:59 2:59 MALE:  [laughter] 
3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  [laughter] --slide it in there.  
3:01 3:04 MALE:  Well I was thinking of like getting like a teaching degree, so I could teach when I'm really old, like 65.  
3:05 3:14 FEMALE:  Well the MBA program, there's a lot of joint degree stuff that they do, so you could get, a lot of, some people do it with Ed school.  So you could get, do a joint degree with the Ed school.  
3:15 3:15 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  Um, one of my good friends is doing that--
3:17 3:17 MALE: Mm-hmm. 
3:17 3:19 FEMALE:  --which is kind of cool if you want to be a teacher.  [laughter] 
3:20 3:20 MALE:  Yeah, it sounds exciting.  
3:21 3:26 FEMALE:  But you could just be a teacher, I mean you don't need to take education, because you'll have a PhD right?  
3:27 3:29 MALE:  Uh, yeah.  Well I'll just have a Masters, I'm not a PhD person, I'm just a Masters.  
3:30 3:34 FEMALE:  Oh you're not a--okay, so, I was going to say, if you're a PhD student and then you want to get an MBA--

3:52 4:00 MALE:  Oh yeah, I definitely, I got some patents I've been working on, I've got a company that I'm going to start, it's going to be like a welcome mat because I want to, I want to really--
           [horn]
4:01 4:05 MALE:  --make a change in the aerospace industry and push things forward and after that full force ahead. 
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Cool.  Well it was very nice to meet you.
