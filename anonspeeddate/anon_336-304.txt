0:47 0:50 FEMALE:  What are you studying and what are you--tell me about yourself.

1:03 1:17 MALE:  Um, I've been--I've been--this is my first year here.  I've been working for a couple of years and I just came back to--to do a masters in EE [phonetic].  And, um, I went to Cal Tech for under grad and I grew up in New York City so.

1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  What borough?

1:18 1:19 MALE:  Brooklyn.

1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Brooklyn.  Awesome.

1:20 1:21 MALE:  Yeah.  What about you?

1:08 1:17 FEMALE:  Um, Tennessee, but my grandma lives in--near Yonkers like in--in West Side Bronx and then now she's in Queens.

1:31 1:33 MALE:  Okay.  That's cool.  Tennessee, wow.

1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:34 1:36 MALE:  Not many Asian people in Tennessee.

1:23 1:28 FEMALE:  No, no.  

1:37 1:37 MALE:  Okay.

1:28 1:29 FEMALE:  It's, uh, not some where I'd want to go back to [unintelligible].  

1:42 1:42 MALE:  Okay.

1:29 1:37 FEMALE:  [laughter].  It's--it's interesting, yeah.  It's kind of like the opposite of New York City.  Did you like that growing up in Brooklyn?

1:52 2:09 MALE:  Um, it's a little tense, but, um--and I definitely I don't want to have my kids grow up there or, you know, whatever.  But I--I, uh, you know, it was enjoyable..  I think I learned a lot, you know, it's, uh, you learn a lot from interacting with a lot of different ethnicity's and stuff like that.  It was cool.  Yeah.

1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Really.

2:09 2:16 MALE:  Yeah.  What do--what do you, uh, did you like Tennessee or no?  It's okay?

2:01 2:06 FEMALE:  Um, of all the places in the US it's probably not my town--like favorite place to be.

2:20 2:20 MALE:  Okay.

2:07 2:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, just 'cause, um, sometimes people can be racist and kind of ignorant and it's just not fun growing up in that kind of [unintelligible] where like it's, you know, they expect you to eat sushi and kempchi [phonetic] or, you know, when you're not even [unintelligible].  Yeah.  But, um, it's a safe place to grow up in a place like--I--well, I grew up in a small town [unintelligible].

2:50 2:54 MALE:  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I--I had to deal with a lot of that too I think when I grew up. 

2:41 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:55 3:14 MALE:  And I grew up in like a--mainly an Italian neighborhood in--in Brooklyn, so it's like--it's a little different.  I mean, I think I never really got to see a lot of Asian people until I went to like high school in--in Manhattan so.  I don't know if it's, you know, the same as you, but I kind of have some experiences in that too so.

3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.

3:16 3:20 MALE:  Yeah.  Well, I guess--I guess you could get over it something--you know you move onto better places like this where--yeah.

3:08 3:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] there is.  Yeah.  So, what do you like to do in your free time?

3:28 3:58 MALE:  I don't have much free time, but, um, when I do I, you know, I just hang out with my friends, go to bars, clubs sometimes.  I do a little snowboarding, I spent--I--I skateboarded for like six years, but that was when I was in high school and college and so I haven't done much of that.  Currently, I'm looking into like business ideas, starting a business, um, you know, pretty [unintelligible] and stuff like that.  So, we'll see how it goes.

3:45 3:45 FEMALE:  Cool.  Yeah.  

3:59 4:01 MALE:  Well, pleasure meeting you, female336.
