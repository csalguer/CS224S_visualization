0:02 0:03 FEMALE: Hi. 
0:02 0:03 MALE: Hi. 
0:04 0:04 FEMALE: I'm female335.
0:04 0:08 MALE: female335. I appreciate good names.  I have a boring name, so--
0:09 0:10 FEMALE: Thank you--what makes a name good?
0:10 0:18 MALE: Well, hey, male311 is, like, the ultimate--what makes a name good is that I can guarantee you probably don't run into, like, Sohinis all over the place.
0:19 0:27 FEMALE: That's true.  It's actually a really, kind of, important part of my identity that I've never met anyone with my name. It's a very uncommon name, even in India. 
0:26 0:27 MALE: Really?  Wow. 
0:28 0:28 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:28 0:29 MALE: And so did you grow up in India?
0:30 0:33 FEMALE: No, but, um, I was born here.  My parents and my sister immigrated. 
0:33 0:33 MALE: Okay. 
0:34 0:35 FEMALE: But, uh--
0:34 0:34 MALE: Wow. 
0:35 0:36 FEMALE: I've never met another female335.
0:36 0:36 MALE: Really?
0:37 0:37 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:36 0:40 MALE: Did you ask your mom whether she just sort of pulled it out of a hat or--
0:40 0:44 FEMALE: Well, see, we're South Indian, and, uh, it's a North Indian name. 
0:44 0:44 MALE: Okay. 
0:45 0:52 FEMALE: It's an old name.  Um, it's also the name of a musical scale, and my parents named both of us after that, so [unintelligible].
0:50 0:56 MALE: I've always like Indian names.  Like, ever--I, I, I think that when I have a kids, I'm just going to look there.
0:57 0:58 FEMALE: Give them Indian names?
0:57 1:03 MALE: Well, like, no, because, like, I--one of my friends, uh, her names is Mangela [phonetic], which I think is a beautiful name. 
1:04 1:05 FEMALE: It's a great name.  Yeah. 
1:04 1:05 MALE: It's a great name. 
1:06 1:09 FEMALE: Although I have to warn you that Indian boy names are not as good. 
1:08 1:10 MALE: Oh, no, no.  I'd agree with that. 
1:09 1:10 FEMALE: I think the girl names are a little better. 
1:10 1:17 MALE: They're like--I'm like, I've met Arabi, seen a million of them.  Get out of here. My name's [unintelligible]. 
1:16 1:19 FEMALE: [laughter]  Yeah.  They're always trying to Americanize their names. 
1:18 1:21 MALE: That's true.  So, so what are you--what are you studying?
1:22 1:26 FEMALE: Um, well, so I went to Stanford for college also.  I was a--I was a math major. 
1:25 1:25 MALE: Wow.
1:27 1:28 FEMALE: And now I study mathematical biology.
1:28 1:29 MALE: Whoa.
1:30 1:30 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:29 1:32 MALE: Is that sort of, like, computational, like, probabilities related to--
1:31 1:33 FEMALE: Exactly.  Right. 
1:33 1:35 MALE: Wow.  That's pretty intense.
1:34 1:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  So I study evolution.
1:35 1:36 MALE: Oh, evolution.
1:37 1:37 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:37 1:40 MALE: Darwin it--or Darwinite or whatever--no? I guess, uh--
1:39 1:41 FEMALE: Darwin, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
1:41 1:46 MALE: Wow.  I was actually going to be a, um--I went to undergrad at Berkley. Boo. 
1:47 1:49 FEMALE: It's okay.  I won't hold it against you. 
1:49 1:59 MALE: Yeah, you're like [unintelligible].  I did undergrad at Berkley, and it was gonna be in anthropology.  So obviously I did, you know, a lot of that, and then I decided I couldn't deal with it anymore. 
2:00 2:02 FEMALE: Did you study cultural or biological.
2:01 2:03 MALE: Uh, physical.  So, yeah, physical biology.
2:03 2:05 FEMALE: Physical.  Okay. Yeah. 
2:04 2:12 MALE: Just trying to figure out what I'd do after, you know, college and I couldn't really figure out.  I was like, nah, I can't really make it for myself. 
2:13 2:13 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:13 2:19 MALE: I decided I'd work for a few years and then you know. And so, then I got a MBA here, and now I'm in the electrical engineering program. 
2:21 2:21 FEMALE: Oh, wow. 
2:21 2:21 MALE: So-- 
2:22 2:23 FEMALE: That's neat. 
2:22 2:24 MALE: Yeah, it's been pretty interesting, although I still think that--
2:25 2:26 FEMALE: Are you getting your MS or your--
2:25 2:27 MALE: MS.  MS.  Yeah. 
2:27 2:27 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:26 2:31 MALE: Yeah, I can't do the PhD.  I'm not--my pocket protector would tell you that I'm a PhD.
2:32 2:35 FEMALE: Double-E is a tough department, though, either way [unintelligible]. 
2:33 2:47 MALE: It is.  It's pretty hard.  But, you know, I'm not trying to become the best double-E person in the world.  My goal is to learn enough to become credible and to think [unintelligible] people when I graduate in the business world. 
2:48 2:54 FEMALE: So in between, did you work at, like, a technology type firm or [unintelligible]?
2:53 2:56 MALE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I actually worked part time at a software company right now. 
2:56 2:57 FEMALE: Oh, great. 
2:57 2:59 MALE: Well, 'cause, you know, Stanford degrees are pretty expensive. 
3:00 3:01 FEMALE: Right, right. 
3:00 3:04 MALE: There's no way.  And you would know.  You're probably like, "Don't even tell me about debt."
3:05 3:08 FEMALE: PhD isn't so expensive.  It's so bad they may--they pay you to do it.  So--
3:08 3:10 MALE: Yeah, exactly.  It's like, if you're gonna go through this--
3:10 3:12 FEMALE: Like a [unintelligible].
3:11 3:14 MALE: Yeah.  We'll pay you, but you'll live like a total rat. 
3:15 3:16 FEMALE: [laughter]. 
3:15 3:17 MALE: Wow.  So what do you think you're gonna do?
3:18 3:19 FEMALE: I want to go into academia. 
3:19 3:19 MALE: Oh, really?
3:20 3:21 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:19 3:27 MALE: Wow.  So what kind of, sort of-- or is it sort of a specialized program that you do for that, or is similar to what you're studying?
3:27 3:52 FEMALE: Yeah, um, so I study human evolution and theory, theory of human evolution.  Um, basically after grad school, you become a post-doctoral fellow and kind of be an independent researcher for a few years and then look for a job at a university.  Um, but the research that I want to do--so there are sort of two sides to the field I'm in, and one is, like, medical genetics and trying to predict, you know, disease genes, look for them in the genome and things like that. 
3:52 3:53 MALE: Okay.  That's huge. 
3:53 4:03 FEMALE: And, um, what I'm work--yeah. That's--it's really neat, but, uh, what I'm more interested is kind of mining through the results of the human genome project and looking for patterns in most populations. 
4:02 4:08 MALE: Oh, that's cool.  Wow.  I don't think I could ever even, like, do that.  My math background is not--
4:10 4:12 FEMALE: I doubt it.  Um, I'm sure you could do it. 
4:12 4:13 MALE: It was nice--well, it was nice meeting you. 
4:14 4:15 FEMALE: It was nice meeting you.
