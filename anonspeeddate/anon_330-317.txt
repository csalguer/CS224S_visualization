00:01 00:37 FEMALE: Um.  Okay, so where were we?  [laughter] You know what's really funny about people come here and they just--it's really--it's a very socially constructed environment, right?  So people don't know what kind of questions they should ask without being quirky or weird or geeky so you have to [unintelligible] and then, like, you know, what do you do for fun?  Which is, like, a pickup line in a bar or something and people who are just, like, have a lot of research, hi, my name is blah, blah, blah.  And they just, like, recite their abstract for their thesis proposal and they're just, like--
00:37 00:41 MALE: [laughter] That's right.  Yeah, I know.  That actually happened to one of the people here.    
00:41 00:41 FEMALE: I know.  
00:42 00:44 MALE: It's like I got the full, the full the scope of what they're doing.  [laughter] 
00:45 01:08 FEMALE: But you've got--I'm basically, actually, if you study these things, people decide if they like the other person--some of the person function, you know, like eye contact, body language and just like the sincerity or the honesty you see in their eyes, like, within the first second.  It doesn't really matter what you talk about.  It's more like, you know, how relaxed and how honest you look like as a person.  
01:10 01:11 MALE: It's the way in which you present yourself.  
01:11 01:11 FEMALE: Yes.  Yeah.  
01:13 01:17 MALE: So how do you, how do you speak Spanish?  I've been wondering about this.  Why do you speak Spanish?  You seem to speak Spanish well.  
01:17 01:22 FEMALE: Yeah, I--I was born in Korea but raised in Argentina so I lived there since I was six years until I was eighteen.  
01:24 01:24 MALE: Oh, okay.
01:24 01:27 FEMALE: All my life.  All my schooling.  And my family is still in Argentina.  
01:28 01:28 MALE: Oh, wow.  
01:27 01:30 FEMALE: So I'm Latin.  And yourself?  [laughter] Can't you tell?  
01:33 01:34 MALE: [unintelligible] 
01:33 01:34 FEMALE: Yeah.  
01:34 01:36 MALE: So you must speak three languages as well?
01:36 01:41 FEMALE: I speak Spanish well.  Korean, so-so.  And English, uh--
01:42 01:43 MALE: Very well.  [laughter] 
01:42 01:45 FEMALE: I don't know.  I have a thick accent, which is hard to understand sometimes.  
01:47 01:48 MALE: The kind of accent people like.  
01:49 01:51 FEMALE: I don't know what people said.  
01:52 01:52 MALE: Yeah, I don't know.  Where was that?  
01:52 01:52 FEMALE: Okay.  
01:53 01:54 MALE: That was, I think, a false alarm.  
01:54 01:56 FEMALE: Okay.  They're trying to trick us now.  [laughter] 
01:58 01:59 MALE: And these are stress interviews now.  
01:58 02:00 FEMALE: [laughter] How we react.  
02:01 02:02 MALE: Did you get done in time.  
02:03 02:11 FEMALE: I know, it's stressful, actually, because, like, you want to finish a conversation and you want to be able to fill things out and, like, you care, but not, like--it's stressful.  
02:13 02:17 MALE: Yeah, so you're talking about a mile a minute and then it's, like, I want a drink to relax.  [laughter]
02:17 02:24 FEMALE: But one of the guys, like, paused for 30 seconds or something and then I'll talk, you're wasting time.  We have four minutes. 
02:25 02:26 MALE: I didn't show up for this, buddy.  
02:28 02:31 FEMALE: [laughter] No, you've got to be efficient, you know.  
02:32 02:33 MALE: Answer the question, buddy.  
02:33 02:36 FEMALE: Like, I'm writing down a lot how efficient you are on this thread, like--
02:37 02:39 MALE: You lose right there.  It's too boring.  It was too suave. 
02:39 02:50 FEMALE: And it's [unintelligible] actually if you, like, help somebody and everyone, they pause, they, like...  I know, I know.  I'll ask a question, I'll be, like, you know, what do you want to be when you grow up?  And--
02:52 02:58 MALE: Oh, I should do that.  I should [laughter].  Oh, in only we had a second round we could do all that.  
02:56 03:04 FEMALE: Or, you like, you know, you're filling this out and you're, like, do I check them out?  Because you're looking at the attractiveness and make them really uncomfortable.  
03:07 03:10 MALE: So [unintelligible] You told me, didn't you?  You're in this IBER program?  
03:09 03:09 FEMALE: IPER.  
03:11 03:16 MALE: IPER.  So what all does it constitute?  What are, what are your different areas?  
03:15 03:20 FEMALE: Um, we have to have two definite areas so I'm a chemical engineer by training--
03:21 03:22 MALE: Excellent.  
03:20 03:36 FEMALE: But in my program I'm trying to mix engineering, water project, water technologies, with entrepreneurship, institutionalist network, chlorination theory.  Well, I don't know what it's going to end up being.  I'm just putting everything in the pot and seeing what happens.  
03:38 03:40 MALE: Oh, I like that.  That's nice.  
03:40 03:52 FEMALE: It's nice but now it's really hard because I have, um, three or four advisers all with their disciplinary training so when I go and talk to them about my questions, it's almost like selling a project over and over--
03:55 03:56 MALE: Yeah, each one [unintelligible].
03:55 04:05 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  It's not very infrequent that one adviser would think that what the other person said is absolute bullshit.  So if you're caught in the middle, I mean, basically--
04:08 04:12 MALE: Get stuck.  But you know when you get out you'll have a lot of nice knowledge, you know.  Practical knowledge.  
04:10 04:11 FEMALE: You promise?  [laughter] 
04:13 04:14 MALE: I think so.  
04:12 04:14 FEMALE: I'll keep--I will hold you accountable for [unintelligible]  
04:16 04:19 MALE: Want me to write a recommendation, she has a lot of practical knowledge.  
04:17 04:18 FEMALE: [laughter] 
04:21 04:22 MALE: Especially how to deal with people with conflicting interests.  
04:21 04:25 FEMALE: Yeah.  And I know this because somebody at speed-dating told me.   
04:27 04:27 MALE: That's right.  
04:28 04:29 FEMALE: Is this your first time?  
04:31 04:33 MALE: Speed-dating?  Yeah.  I don't think it happened like this.  
04:32 04:39 FEMALE: I think everybody says that anyway.  Like, if you ask, nobody is going to say, oh, this is my tenth time and every single time I didn't get picked.  
04:40 04:42 MALE: I still haven't gotten a date.  [laughter] 
04:40 04:43 FEMALE: I haven't gotten picked so I come back every time.  
04:45 04:50 MALE: What am I doing wrong?  Maybe you can tell me.  [laughter] 
04:48 04:49 FEMALE: Please pick me.  Please pick me.  
04:52 04:55 MALE: Will you contact me?  Can I transfer myself in here?  
04:53 05:12 FEMALE: Let me give you my card just in case.  That's illegal.  Yeah, I think you can only go to, like dancing related kind of--sometimes they ask for your number and you--you tell them politely, like, you know, I actually came with somebody or something and they still stuck their card on you for their phone number--
05:14 05:15 MALE: Figure it's worth two cents, right?  
05:14 05:15 FEMALE: How are you getting that?  
05:17 05:18 MALE: You think only Chinese [unintelligible].  
05:16 05:19 FEMALE: Yeah, I mean, it's weird.  But...  
05:21 05:23 MALE: Well, it was nice meeting you.  
05:20 05:21 FEMALE: I know.  Enjoyed it.  
05:24 05:25 MALE: We'll have to do this again sometime.  
05:23 05:24 FEMALE: Sure.
