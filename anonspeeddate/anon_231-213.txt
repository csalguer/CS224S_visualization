0:00 0:01 FEMALE: How're you doing?

0:04 0:05 MALE: Good, how are you?

0:02 0:03 FEMALE: Good.  I'm okay.

0:06 0:08 MALE: Are you enjoying this?

0:05 0:13 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's uh, it gets exhausting after a while, you know?  You've got to wonder if uh people's scores go down or go up or something towards the end of the night just because people get tired.  So.

0:17 0:24 MALE: I was just thinking that it's probably not the best uh setting to really showcase somebody's personality.  To meet someone else in four minutes.

0:19 0:22 FEMALE: Really, you think in four minutes here in the lobby?

0:25 0:27 MALE: Something about it, just, yeah.

0:24 0:26 FEMALE: [laughter] Doesn't scream get to know me?

0:28 0:32 MALE: I think that, I think that I probably would like, like most of the people here if I was to meet them somewhere else.

0:29 0:31 FEMALE: But automatically you're not going to like us, so--

0:35 0:36 MALE: No, no, no.

0:32 0:33 FEMALE: I'm [unintelligible] [laughter].

0:36 0:37 MALE: I don't mean that.

0:34 0:39 FEMALE: Yeah.  I think it's, you know, it's funny, 'cause um I had some friends that did the last one.

0:42 0:43 MALE: Uh-huh.  

0:40 0:45 FEMALE: And they were saying that some of the four minutes really dragged on, but usually the four minutes were up very quickly, so--

0:48 0:49 MALE: Yeah.  

0:45 0:50 FEMALE: which has been my experience so far anyway.  So are you an engineer?

0:54 0:57 MALE: You have to ask right away?  You have to?

0:54 0:57 FEMALE: I don't.  Forget I said that.  So um--

1:01 1:02 MALE: Yes, I am, so [laughter].

0:58 1:02 FEMALE: What do you like to do for fun?  What's the, what's your favorite thing about San Francisco?

1:06 1:11 MALE: Um well, outside of there are, there are cool bums.

1:08 1:09 FEMALE: Cool pubs?

1:11 1:12 MALE: I don't want to call them bums.

1:10 1:11 FEMALE: Bums.

1:14 1:20 MALE: Because they're cool people and cool people don't get called bums.  Um, there is one who said he'd been on uh Letterman.

1:17 1:18 FEMALE: Oh yeah?

1:20 1:24 MALE: And he had some, some jokes which I had heard from other places before, but he said he wrote them.

1:21 1:22 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:24 1:34 MALE: And uh the best one was definitely the time we were walking drunk and he uh, comes with the shaking thing of money and he walks down the street backwards in front of us, and he tells jokes the whole time, the whole block.

1:30 1:32 FEMALE: Right.  So he's entertaining you.

1:34 1:36 MALE: And he somehow got everybody to give him money, it was amazing.

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Great.  Yeah.  

1:38 1:40 MALE: It's amazing that like those guys really can have a game, and just--

1:37 1:41 FEMALE: Oh yeah.  There's one in particular--I have some friends that live up near, like, 15th and Church.

1:44 1:45 MALE: Uh-huh.  

1:42 1:48 FEMALE: And uh they have a guest bedroom, so whenever I go up, I stay with them, and there's one particular bum who always finds me a parking spot.

1:51 1:52 MALE: Who always finds you--

1:48 1:49 FEMALE: Finds me a parking spot.

1:52 1:54 MALE: Finds you a parking spot.  Excellent.

1:50 1:52 FEMALE: Right.  Which, you know, I mean, like, it's an open spot.

1:55 1:57 MALE: Is it a dollar, is it five dollars or--?

1:54 1:55 FEMALE: It's a dollar.

1:58 1:59 MALE: It's a dollar.  Okay.  

1:55 2:03 FEMALE: You know, I usually give him a handful of change that's in my car.  And that's fine, 'cause he'll jump into the spot and make sure no one else takes it.  It's not like anybody else is going to take it, you know, 'cause--

2:05 2:06 MALE: Yeah.  

2:03 2:07 FEMALE: Generally I'm right there when he does it, but, you know, yeah, they're pretty friendly.  

2:10 2:11 MALE: Not bad.

2:08 2:13 FEMALE: I was in San Francisco this weekend actually and I was reading for one of my classes The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.  It's a--

2:16 2:19 MALE: I've heard of that.  So you must not be a techie.

2:15 2:17 FEMALE: It's a book--no, I'm not.

2:20 2:21 MALE: Okay.

2:18 2:20 FEMALE: Although I, I study techies sometimes.

2:23 2:27 MALE: What's, what's your general subject?  I don't want to really spend--

2:21 2:24 FEMALE: You don't really want to know?  Um--

2:27 2:29 MALE: I don't want to spend time talking about it really.

2:26 2:27 FEMALE: I'm in the department of communication.

2:30 2:31 MALE: Oh cool, okay.

2:28 2:32 FEMALE: So I'm taking this course in uh, like, history of computing and information in society stuff.

2:35 2:36 MALE: Uh-huh.  

2:33 2:40 FEMALE: And so I'm reading this book, it's about--it's a Tom Wolfe novel about the Merry Pranksters and nameX Kesey and, like, the 1960s San Francisco LSD scene.

2:43 2:45 MALE: Yeah.  I've heard of the book, yeah.

2:42 2:51 FEMALE: So I was sitting at coffee shops this weekend reading, 'cause I was doing homework during the day, and I can't tell you how many friends I made.  People coming up and saying hey that's a great book, and I'm like, it is, you know.  [laughter] 

2:53 2:55 MALE: Excellent.  Yeah.  

2:51 2:52 FEMALE: Why don't you tell me about it, so.

2:55 2:59 MALE: Yeah you just go up in San Francisco with something hippie, and you'll have--

2:55 2:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's very self-referential.  It's a book about San Francisco, so.

3:01 3:04 MALE: Well I guess I should read it.  I haven't actually read that one.

3:01 3:05 FEMALE: It's worth--it's worth reading.  Do you enjoy, like do you get a chance to read for fun or--?

3:07 3:10 MALE: I enjoy some books that are kind of along the same lines.

3:07 3:08 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:11 3:12 MALE: As that probably, so--

3:08 3:09 FEMALE: Like what?

3:13 3:20 MALE: Like um, um well I really liked Timothy Leary's autobiography, even though I've never done LSD.  But I thought he was--I thought he was a really entertaining writer and--

3:17 3:18 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:21 3:24 MALE: Just his stories, and um Tom Robbins is a lot of fun too.  Have you ever read him?

3:21 3:22 FEMALE: Tom Robbins is great.  

3:25 3:26 MALE: Yeah.  

3:22 3:23 FEMALE: What was the first Tom Robbins you ever read?

3:27 3:28 MALE: Jitterbug Perfume.

3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Ah.

3:28 3:30 MALE: And the best one as well.  I read others and they never--

3:27 3:34 FEMALE: Even Cowgirls Get the Blues was my first one, and I had never even heard of the guy, and a friend of mine was like--I was actually living in Germany, and a friend of mine said if you can find this book, find it.
