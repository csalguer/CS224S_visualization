0:51 0:51 MALE:  Uh-mm.
0:51 0:57 FEMALE:  And so we'd go up, kind of upstate and go around up there, but um, we did a couple trips up in Canada, near Montreal, and that was really awesome.

1:20 1:21 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:23 1:38 FEMALE:  Exactly, plenty of cushioning for me to just eat snow and then you know, my friends, obviously are really excellent, so, they really enjoy it too because they do all like triple black diamonds and that nonsense.  What about yourself?  Are you really aggressive?  You go big go home or are you more relaxed?

2:10 2:30 FEMALE:  I know.  I know.  I didn't even get out at all this year, which is like horrible, 'cause that just brings me back to square one next time I get on the -- like what's a snowboard?  Like what?  [laughter] lose all of my skills, what little they are.  I mean the best I've done with the half pipe is hike down it.  Like, wow, what's this?  So, yeah.
