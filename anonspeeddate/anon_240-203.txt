0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  I'm going to do the New York bar.
0:35 0:40 MALE:  Oh, okay.  My, my brother did that two years ago and uh, after law school.
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  It's hell.
0:41 0:49 MALE:  Yeah, it's, and he, he didn't have fun doing it, but uh.  Are you planning on working in New York then or, have a job lined up and everything in Manhattan?

0:50 0:51 MALE:  Nice.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  I'm going to the Big Apple.

0:53 0:55 FEMALE: I'm going to go to an anonymous corporate job.
0:57 1:04 MALE:  Yeah, I can, I can appreciate that.  I have a summer job with Exxon this year, so, I definitely know the uh, getting the accustomed to the corporate type thing.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  And where is that going to be?
1:05 1:07 MALE:  Uh, Houston, actually, so.
1:07 1:08 FEMALE: Do you like Houston?
1:09 1:23 MALE:  Eh [laughter] well, I'm from a northern part of Canada, so the climate change at Houston kills me.  I went there uh, a few summers ago and hit the summer heat humidity, hurricanes and all that stuff.  And I'm from; you know barren arctic tundra, so.
1:24 1:25 FEMALE:  That's pretty cool.
1:25 1:29 MALE:  So, it's a big, it's a big difference between minus 40 to, you know 100 with humidity.
1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:30 1:31 MALE:  So, a bit drastic for me, but uh.
1:32 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah, no, no, no, I was in Houston in October just for like a long weekend.  But um, I didn't like it very much.
1:40 1:59 MALE:  No it's like, I viewed it, it's like LA, but it's all of bad LA, it has all the bad LA things but not the good LA things.  So it has smog, its worst.  It has traffic, you know, almost as bad.  It has urban sprawl, it has crappy neighborhoods, but it doesn't have a good beach.  It doesn't have nice, you know, coastal communities.  It doesn't have nice climate.  So it's like all the bad LA things wrapped up into one.
2:00 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, and I felt like the people were kind of insensitive.  Like, LA has like so many different types of people that you're like okay, there are definitely people here you can meet and like--
2:06 2:14 MALE:  Yeah, so they, the Texas types are, kind of, yeah, it, it's, yeah, Houston, it, it's an odd place.    Where have you lived in the US prior to here?  Were you...?
2:14 2:17 FEMALE:  I am native northern California actually.
2:17 2:17 MALE:  Really?
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  So, I'm from San Jose, which is like 20 minutes from...
2:20 2:23 MALE:  Yeah, I know, been to San Jose a few times.
2:24 2:25 FEMALE:  There's not a lot going on.
2:24 2:29 MALE:   Good ole' San Pedro square and First Street and uh, whatever else.  The Tech Museum.
2:29 2:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
2:30 2:32 MALE:  Santana row I guess, I don't know.
2:32 2:35 FEMALE:  Santana row, though I can't afford anything there.
2:34 2:36 MALE:  Yeah, it's a pretty good shopping place.
2:36 2:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, unlike me [unintelligible].
2:39 2:40 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  But I can look, oh look at these...
2:41 2:43 MALE:  Exactly look at that, like ah, sure.
2:44 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
2:44 2:47 MALE:  Nice to know.  Did you do undergrad around here or?
2:47 2:48 FEMALE:  I went to Berkeley.
2:48 2:49 MALE:  Oh, okay, yeah.
2:49 2:52 FEMALE:  I've actually never really left the Bay area [laughter].
2:52 2:54 MALE:  Uh, it's after--
2:53 2:54 FEMALE:  That's why I got to go to New York.
2:55 3:10 MALE: After moving here, I can definitely appreciate the uh, appreciate the, why people wouldn't want to leave.  Like I'm from, you know arctic tundra and so I came here and thought, wow, this is really nice, I could stay here forever.  And at this point it's starting to feel like.  Year five PhD; it's starting to feel like forever, so.
3:11 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, no, no, no, I mean, I actually interviewed for a clerkship in Alaska and like...
3:16 3:17 MALE:  Oh, really?
3:17 3:27 FEMALE:  The guy who interviewed me was just like, you know, um, are you really prepared to like come to Alaska, because, you know since it is, it's just abysmal weather and not a lot of people, even in Juno.
3:27 3:28 MALE:  Yeah.
3:29 3:32 FEMALE:  And he was just like yeah, well you may not know what you're getting into [laughter].
3:32 3:42 MALE:  Yeah, it's um, the place I'm from is not quite Alaska north, but it's pretty far north.  It's the, like city of a million but for not very, yeah, it's really far north for a city of a million.
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  What city?
3:44 3:49 MALE:  Uh, Edmonton, Edmonton Alberta, it's, if you ever know hockey, Wayne Gretsky is from there, that's about it.
