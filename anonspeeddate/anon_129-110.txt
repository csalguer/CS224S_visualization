0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  How you doing?
0:04 0:04 MALE:  Good, how are you?
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  I'm like ripping these pages out [unintelligible].  
0:05 0:06 MALE:  Actually, don't worry about it.  
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  I'm female129.
0:07 0:07 MALE:  female129.  
0:08 0:09 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:15 0:17 MALE:  Are you having a good time?  How are you?
0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  I'm good.  I'm great.  [laughter]
0:20 0:23 MALE:  It's like two hours of talking, man.
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  But it's been fun.  
0:23 0:25 MALE:  Yeah, it's very interesting.  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, what else do you have going on Thursday night, right?  
0:26 0:29 MALE:  Thursday nights, yeah, I've got some parties to go to with some friends.  
0:30 0:34 FEMALE:  You're [unintelligible].  Most of the guys were like it's better than studying.  
0:34 0:49 MALE:  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, I don't have any classes on Fridays, so Thursdays are actually effectively my Friday.  And like Friday I used to like quiet down a little bit, so [unintelligible] for dinner and something like that.  
0:49 0:52 FEMALE:  So, I don't have class after 11:30 on Wednesdays. 
0:52 0:53 MALE:  Ah, okay.  
0:53 0:55 FEMALE:  So, I just have like most of the week is the weekend.  
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:56 1:00 FEMALE:  Although today was actually a really busy day.  So, but it was fun.  
1:00 1:03 MALE:  So, what are you guys--what do you guys--yeah, what department are you in?
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: I'm at the ed school. 
1:05 1:05 MALE: The ed school right.
1:05 1:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  How about you?
1:06 1:08 MALE:  I'm the MBA second year.  
1:08 1:09 FEMALE: Okay, second year.  Do you know what you're doing?
1:10 1:12 MALE: No.  
1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  Bad question?
1:13 1:15 MALE: No, no, [unintelligible] question.  
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Do you know what you want to do?  
1:16 1:23 MALE:  Yeah, I'm starting a [unintelligible] on whether I'm going to attract money or not like coming back as a company.  
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  Super.  What kind of company?  
1:25 1:33 MALE:  It's [unintelligible] games, allmygames.  You know, Sony, PlayStation, that type of stuff, like very male, very [unintelligible].  
1:33 1:37 FEMALE:  Not necessarily male.  I mean it happens to not necessarily be my thing, but there are plenty of--
1:37 1:40 MALE:  No, no, I understand your point.  
1:40 1:43 FEMALE:  So, you're looking for a company to back you up and say, hey, go do it.  
1:43 1:52 MALE:  Yeah, a couple of people from [unintelligible] one and a couple of CS guys like [unintelligible] how to, you know, [unintelligible].
1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Great.  
1:54 1:54 MALE:  But like [unintelligible].  
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  Is it down here?  
1:55 1:59 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] all day.  Where are you from?  
2:00 2:05 FEMALE:  I grew up in Houston, but I moved here from Boston.  It's like crisscrossing the country, and--
2:05 2:06 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, everybody does that, right?  
2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  Why not?  How about you?  Where are you from?  
2:08 2:10 MALE:  Yeah, I'm from [unintelligible] originally.  
2:10 2:10 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:11 2:14 MALE:  I've lived in Southern California and [unintelligible].  
2:14 2:17 FEMALE:  So, you're crisscrossing the country, you're crisscrossing the globe?  
2:17 2:18 MALE:  Yeah, I've been [unintelligible].  
2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:19 2:20 MALE:  And then I'm kind of--
2:20 2:27 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, it's getting a little ridiculous.  When I decided to come out here, it was like, you know, I can always go back to the East Coast. 
2:27 2:27 MALE:  Right.  
2:27 2:30 FEMALE:  But now when I think about going back, it's a little ridiculous. 
2:30 2:30 MALE: Yeah.  
2:31 2:35 FEMALE:  I just moved here, 3,000 miles--it's not completely incomprehensible.  
2:35 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, it's very far away.  
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  yeah.  
2:38 2:40 MALE:  It's far away from home.  It's far away from Boston.  
2:40 2:46 FEMALE:  It is.  I actually though--I have two sisters.  One is in Boston, and one is in San Francisco.  
2:46 2:46 MALE:  Oh.  
2:46 2:51 FEMALE:  So, that's actually made it relatively easy because I feel like--
2:51 2:55 MALE:  [interposing] So you guys are all [unintelligible], right?  
2:55 2:59 FEMALE:  If by a typical Houston family you mean everybody--
2:59 3:00 MALE:  [interposing]  Well, [unintelligible] usually--yeah.  
3:01 3:04 FEMALE:  So that you can at least go back--
3:04 3:07 MALE:  [interposing]  You know, yeah, go to UC, go to Rice, and then go back home, something like that, right?  
3:07 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No, no, I actually recently got to the point where I realized that it's not really appropriate anymore to say that I'm from Houston.  It's more like I grew up in Houston.  
3:17 3:17 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  My parents aren't there anymore.  
3:20 3:20 MALE:  Right.  
3:20 3:24 FEMALE:  So, I go to Houston to visit my grandmother, but other than that--
3:24 3:24 MALE:  [interposing]  Right.  
3:24 3:37 FEMALE:  I actually went there last weekend, and I rented a car.  And I was by myself, and I went to visit my grandmother.  I was by myself, and I had to call my sister and--like, am I on the right highway?  She was laughing at me like [unintelligible].  
3:37 3:37 MALE:  Uh, [unintelligible].  
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  You might not be from Houston anymore.  
3:39 3:39 MALE:  Right.  
3:40 3:44 FEMALE:  But, you know, it was a great place to grow up and a great place to leave.  
3:44 3:50 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's [unintelligible].  That's a good place to be from.  
3:51 3:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think it's true of a lot of places actually.  
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:53 3:57 FEMALE: I didn't realize [unintelligible] until I left.  But, you know--
3:57 3:57 MALE:  [interposing]  Right, yeah.  
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  So--
3:58 4:07 MALE:  [interposing]  I spend my time [unintelligible] LA, definitely not on a [unintelligible] anywhere but, you know--
4:07 4:07 FEMALE:  [interposing] On the coast?  
4:08 4:09 MALE:  Or, actually to Alaska.  
4:09 4:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, no--I hear you.  I hear you, a big country, and [unintelligible].  
4:13 4:13 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:13 4:18 FEMALE:  Not particularly [unintelligible] desirable places to be, but--
4:18 4:19 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, exactly.  
4:19 4:23 FEMALE:  Well, have fun.  You're almost done.  Enjoy the rest of your time.
