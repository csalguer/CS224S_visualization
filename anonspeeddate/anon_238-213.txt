00:01  00:01	MALE:  [horn].
00:02  00:03	FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  I'm not done yet.
00:04  00:04	MALE:  That's okay.
00:05  00:06	FEMALE:  Okay.  I'm slow.  This is hard.
00:16  00:16	MALE:  Isn't it?
00:17  00:19	FEMALE:  Not the talking part, the filling the thing out part.
00:20  00:21	MALE:  What about the rating if different people are intelligent or not.  Doesn't that feel a little bit weird?
00:22  00:23	FEMALE:  It does feel a little bit weird.
00:23  00:25	MALE:  Like I'm able to pass judgment on whether you're intelligent.
00:26  00:36	FEMALE:  In four minutes.  I'm just -- I'm just probably giving everyone a five.  I'm like well; there at Stanford you can't be that dumb.  Yet your in Stanford you can't be that smart [laughter] so you know.
00:37  00:40	MALE:  What do you mean?  Ooo, what do you mean?  Why can you not be that smart?  Please explain your statement?  No you don't have to.
00:41  00:43	FEMALE:  Okay good.
00:44  00:44	MALE:  Hi.  I'm male213.
00:45  00:45	FEMALE:  Hi male213.  I'm female238.
00:46  00:46	MALE:  Nice to meet you.
00:47  00:48	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  Are you having a good time?
00:48  00:49	MALE:  It's interesting.  Yeah, I am.
00:50  00:50	FEMALE:  Good.
00:51  00:51	MALE:  Are you?
00:52  01:00	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So far so good.  Plus, I just get to sit here and let people pass through so, I'm now inhabiting my space fully.  I feel good about it.
01:01  01:02	MALE:  How's that, inhabiting your space fully.
01:02  01:02	FEMALE:  It's good.
01:02  01:03	MALE:  Just this sort of backdrop is all you.  
01:04  01:07	FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  It's not really my best color, but you work with what you got.
01:08  01:09	MALE:  This is the backdrop of female238. So, what are you going to do?
01:10  01:11	FEMALE:  Yeah, so.
01:12  01:17	MALE:  So who are you other than the woman in seat R?
01:18  01:24	FEMALE:  That's a deep question.  It's really become part of my identity so far, so I don't know.
01:25  01:26	MALE:  You don't have to answer if you're not comfortable.
01:26  01:31	FEMALE:  Um, graduate student.  I'm writing my dissertation.
01:32  01:33	MALE:   Cool.  So you're at the end.
01:34  01:37	FEMALE:  I'm at the end and it's great because I can do it on my back porch in the sun.
01:38  01:39	MALE:  So you live off campus.
01:39  01:40	FEMALE:  I live off campus.
01:41  01:42	MALE:  Are you in the school of education by any chance?
01:43  01:45	FEMALE:  That's an F point guess.  Why do you ask?
01:46  01:53	MALE:  Why is it wrong.  Because um, most of the women I've went out on a dates with tonight, if you want to call them that were school of education.
01:54  02:01	FEMALE:  Okay.  No, but some of my committee members are in education.  So, I'm an interdisciplinary woman.  So I'm in linguistics.
02:02  02:04	MALE:  Oh, right on.  So what do you like to do in linguistics?
02:05  02:05	FEMALE:  What are you?
02:06  02:07	MALE:  I'm in engineering.
02:07  02:08	FEMALE:  Okay.
02:08  02:12	MALE:  I think linguistics is really cool.  Oh do you know a guy named nameX nameX?
02:13  02:13	FEMALE:  Who?
02:14  02:15	MALE:   nameX nameX?
02:16  02:25	FEMALE:  Yes.  nameX is the graduate representative of myself for graduates.  And we rise up against the faculty together from time to time and stuff.  So yeah, nameX is a good guy.  
02:26  02:30	MALE:  I've known nameX for um, maybe nine years.
02:31  02:31	FEMALE:  Really?
02:32  02:32	MALE:  Yeah.
02:32  02:33	FEMALE:  How, how do you guys know each other?
02:33  02:34	MALE:  We were in the same fraternity in undergrad.
02:34  02:35	FEMALE:  Okay.
02:35  02:38	MALE:  He was even more senior guy than me.
02:39  02:40	FEMALE:  Yeah, did he initiate you?
02:40  02:44	MALE:  No, he did not.  But he was one of the older guys I looked up to when I was starting out. 
02:45  02:48	FEMALE:  Oh.
02:49  02:50	MALE:  And I still look up to him some, he's a cool guy.
02:50  02:51	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So do you hang out with him now?  Or do you see him at all or?
02:52  02:56	MALE:  Um, I've hung out with him like only twice.
02:57  02:57	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:58  03:00	MALE:  And I only knew that he was here for the last six months or so.  
03:01  03:01	FEMALE:  Right.
03:02  03:04	MALE:  So, not all that, two three times a couple of times.
03:05  03:08	FEMALE:  That's pretty good, six months.  Well, people are busy.  How long have you been on campus?  I mean --
03:09  03:09	MALE:  Four years.
03:10  03:11	FEMALE:  Three years.
03:12  03:12	MALE:  Four years.
03:13  03:15	FEMALE:  Four years.  Okay, so you are doing PhD too.  And okay, that's cool.  And so do you have a topic picked yet?
03:16  03:36	MALE:  Um, basically yeah.  Um, I can't really explain it in like 30 seconds, but I want to do medical devices when I'm out.  I'm in electrical engineering.  And you know you're in actually -- you're in linguistics, that's right.  Okay, I was kind of placing that --
03:37  03:38	FEMALE:  What's your fraternity?
03:39  03:39	MALE:  Phi Kappa Beta.
03:40  03:46	FEMALE:  And do you still have a network of like brotherhood or whatever -- [unintelligible] Greek like at my college, so it's all very exotic to me.
03:47  03:48	MALE:  Where did you go?
03:49  03:49	FEMALE:  Georgetown.
03:49  03:50	MALE:  Georgetown?
03:50  03:51	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, no frats up there.
03:52  03:59	MALE:  Yeah.  So Washington is kind of sweet.  My brother wanted to go to Georgetown, like quite a lot, but he did not [horn].
04:00  04:00	FEMALE:  I'm sorry to hear that.
04:01  04:02	MALE:  Well, I guess that's our date.
04:02  04:03	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
04:03  04:09	MALE:  Yeah, he went to American and my father decided that all the students at Georgetown were weird.  So it was okay.  But, I think that was a little bit judgmental.
04:10  04:11	FEMALE:  There no more here than the ones over at American.
04:11  04:12	MALE:  Yeah.
04:12  04:12	FEMALE:  That's not fair.
04:13  04:14	MALE:  Definitely not.  Nice meeting you.
04:14  04:15	FEMALE:  All right, male213.  Nice to meet you.
