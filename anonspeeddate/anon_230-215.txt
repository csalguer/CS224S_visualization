0:00 0:02 FEMALE: [unintelligible] I'm female230 by the way.

0:03 0:04 MALE: male215 [phonetic] [unintelligible].

0:02 0:03 FEMALE: You have such an interesting name.

0:06 0:08 MALE: It's from Cypress.  [unintelligible].

0:03 0:04 FEMALE: [unintelligible].

0:15 0:17 MALE: They'll have to rewind the tape.

0:05 0:06 FEMALE: I know.  Sorry, this experiment [unintelligible].

0:26 0:27 MALE: Can we start or--?

0:06 0:09 FEMALE: No clue.  I hate this [unintelligible].  [horn] Oh okay, now.

0:31 0:32 MALE: We can start now.

0:11 0:12 FEMALE: How are you?

0:33 0:34 MALE: I'm okay thank you.

0:13 0:15 FEMALE: Cypress, that's awesome.

0:35 0:39 MALE: Yeah.  I'm from the U.K. but my family are from Cypress so.

0:17 0:18 FEMALE: So your family moved there when you were pretty young or--?

0:40 0:45 MALE: Uh well I was born there.  My dad's been there for a long time, so.  Where are you from?

0:22 0:23 FEMALE: Well my accent is slightly British too.  I'm from Singapore.

0:47 0:48 MALE: Oh okay.

0:26 0:30 FEMALE: So you guys colonialized us when we didn't have a choice and now we're just all--we all hate you.

0:52 0:53 MALE: Sorry about that.  [laughter] 

0:32 0:38 FEMALE: So it's not your fault, it's your ancestors now okay.  [laughter]  But uh so have you, have you been to Cypress and do you plan to live there anytime or--?

1:01 1:07 MALE: Yeah well, we go regularly for a couple of days, but can't really live there because of the career situations.  It's quite difficult, so.

0:45 0:48 FEMALE: Yeah.  That's what I would guess.

1:08 1:10 MALE: Do you plan to go back to Singapore?

0:48 0:50 FEMALE: I will.  I will.  Um the government actually sponsored my education here.

1:12 1:13 MALE: Oh okay.

0:51 0:54 FEMALE: So in return for you know, four years' worth of tuition, they have me for six years.

1:15 1:16 MALE: Right.  

0:55 0:57 FEMALE: It's like indentured servitude if you think about it.

1:20 1:21 MALE: Okay.  I've got a good friend from Singapore actually.

0:59 1:00 FEMALE: Really?

1:22 1:23 MALE: We've kept in touch, so.

1:01 1:05 FEMALE: Oh is she my--I'm born in '82, so is she, like, sort of my age or--?

1:27 1:30 MALE: Uh she's older than you.  Yeah.  She is older than you.

1:08 1:10 FEMALE: So did you go to Cambridge or Oxford or one of those?

1:32 1:33 MALE: I went to Cambridge, yeah.

1:11 1:12 FEMALE: I almost went to Cambridge.

1:34 1:35 MALE: Oh okay.

1:13 1:18 FEMALE: My choice was between Yale for under--uh, Yale College, for uh econ, or uh, modern college at Cambridge for law.

1:41 1:42 MALE: Okay.  

1:20 1:23 FEMALE: And I decided that--I saw the law books that they--you know they send you a reading list.

1:45 1:46 MALE: Yeah.  

1:24 1:32 FEMALE: In preparation for matriculating, and I looked at the list and I went to check the books, and I said if I'm going to study these books I'll die of boredom and so I, I chucked the law.

1:53 1:55 MALE: Okay.  So what are you doing here?

1:34 1:36 FEMALE: Right now, MS and E.  Management science and engineering.

1:58 1:59 MALE: Okay.  

1:38 1:39 FEMALE: What, what are you?  I know--

2:00 2:01 MALE: Genetics.

1:39 1:45 FEMALE: There's nothing engineering in what I'm doing.  It's basically just a business school for people with an entrepreneurial bent, perhaps, you could say.

2:07 2:08 MALE: Okay.  

1:46 1:51 FEMALE: So, so they're interested in learning about strategy, about uh organizational behavior or entrepreneurship.

2:13 2:14 MALE: Okay.  Yeah.  

1:52 1:53 FEMALE: So genetics.

2:15 2:16 MALE: Genetics.

1:54 1:55 FEMALE: So you did medicine at Cambridge?

2:17 2:22 MALE: Uh no, I did molecular biology there.  I say genetics but it's a mixture of lots of different types of biology.

2:00 2:01 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:23 2:30 MALE: Molecular biology, biochemistry, uh physiology.  So neuroscience now as well, so.

2:08 2:10 FEMALE: How long have you been here in the States?

2:32 2:33 MALE: Only five or six weeks.

2:11 2:12 FEMALE: No kidding.

2:34 2:36 MALE: Yeah.  I just throw myself in at the deep end, so.

2:14 2:16 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  You're starting early here.

2:38 2:41 MALE: Yeah, I'm doing a post-doc here so.

2:19 2:22 FEMALE: How many more years for that, probably five, yeah?

2:42 2:45 MALE: Three or four years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  

2:23 2:26 FEMALE: How do you like it so far?  Are you having any [unintelligible] culture shock?

2:47 2:56 MALE: It's going really well.  You could say that, yeah.  It's quite different to the U.K., despite having the same language, it is very different.  [unintelligible].

2:33 2:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  People here, they are obnoxious and they talk too much, so you just have to get used to that, you know.

3:00 3:01 MALE: I'll probably survive.  [laughter] 

2:40 2:46 FEMALE: No, I mean, that's the funny thing.  I mean when I came here I was just like every other foreign student who seeks shelter in America's arms, but hates her gut.

3:09 3:10 MALE: [laughter].

2:48 2:59 FEMALE: But after a while you'll be amazed at how quickly they win you over.  They are very--I think in general I would say Americans are really frank, direct, and warm.  Sometimes you think they're too warm.  You wish they would just keep their opinions to theirselves.

3:21 3:22 MALE: [laughter].

3:00 3:07 FEMALE: Like, I, I remember most clearly one of the earliest impressions I had at Yale was this girl coming up to me, oh my gosh, your dress is so cute.  You know.

3:30 3:31 MALE: Yeah.  

3:09 3:17 FEMALE: They do this out of a natural exuberance, but us as, you know, cold, stiff, British type people, we're like, we're like get away from me--

3:38 3:39 MALE: Yeah.  

3:17 3:25 FEMALE: --you weirdo monkey, you know.  So you get used to them after a while, and you recognize the genuine part of them.  And they're not perfect, like every others, but I'm sure you'd be the last one to say your own people are perfect, so--

3:47 3:48 MALE: Yeah.  

3:26 3:31 FEMALE: All those hooligans back there in the U.K.  I have visited Oxford when I visited Cambridge.

3:53 3:54 MALE: Okay.  

3:32 3:35 FEMALE: I figured if I go to Cambridge I'll start regretting I didn't go, you know.

3:57 3:58 MALE: Well--

3:36 3:37 FEMALE: I heard it's beautiful.

3:58 4:00 MALE: You made a good choice by coming here as well.

3:38 3:40 FEMALE: You think so?  But Cambridge is, is a beautiful place, I mean.

4:02 4:04 MALE: It's a, yeah, it's a nice place, it's a--

3:40 3:44 FEMALE: Here at Stanford there are a lot of uh Cambridge students.  I don't know if you've met anyone.

4:06 4:07 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:47 3:48 FEMALE: I made good friends here--well, two of my good friends here just came from Cambridge too.

4:10 4:12 MALE: Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  

3:49 3:50 FEMALE: It's just [unintelligible]--

4:12 4:21 MALE: No, I met a guy from Cambridge--well, he's American, but he's from--I met him at Cambridge and he came to Stanford as well, so, yeah, people tend to--

3:57 4:00 FEMALE: That is funny.  Are they Americans for the most part, in Cambridge?  I, I wouldn't have--

4:21 4:23 MALE: There are lots of Americans, yeah.

4:01 4:02 FEMALE: Really?

4:24 4:25 MALE: Yeah.  

4:03 4:07 FEMALE: They actually uh put aside their nationalism for a foreign experience.  That's amazing.

4:30 4:32 MALE: Well [horn] I've met some really good Americans in the [unintelligible] .

4:11 4:12 FEMALE: Well, it was nice to meet you.

4:34 4:36 MALE: Yeah, you too.  Good luck.
