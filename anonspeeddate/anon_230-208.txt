0:01 0:03 FEMALE: It's just weird for me [unintelligible].  It's--

0:04 0:06 MALE: That's--I don't know, this--

0:05 0:06 FEMALE: Have you been to one of these before?

0:06 0:07 MALE: Uh-uh.

0:07 0:08 FEMALE: Me too.

0:07 0:08 MALE: First time.

0:08 0:17 FEMALE: Me too.  [horn]  My whole suite's here, 'cause uh one of my roommates is doing the uh research with the professor, so she hooked, like, she got us all involved as part of girls' night out, so.

0:18 0:22 MALE: She got you to do some sort of tips and tactics for how do you nail the thing?

0:23 0:29 FEMALE: No.  No, I have no clue.  I mean, we're just here to see what it's like, have a good time.  Your accent is so interesting, where are you from?

0:29 0:30 MALE: Australia.

0:30 0:31 FEMALE: Australia?

0:31 0:32 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

0:31 0:32 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore.

0:32 0:33 MALE: Oh wow.

0:33 0:38 FEMALE: So my, my mother and father actually have a small place in Australia.  They're thinking of moving there after retirement.  

0:38 0:39 MALE: Oh really?

0:38 0:42 FEMALE: They have a place on the Gold Coast.  They're like, we're going to leave you guys behind and go to Brisbane.  [unintelligible].

0:43 0:44 MALE: That's a great place to live.

0:44 0:45 FEMALE: Which part are you from?

0:45 0:46 MALE: From more the south, in Melbourne.

0:46 0:47 FEMALE: South?  Melbourne.

0:47 0:51 MALE: There are a lot of kind of middle aged and older settle up in Gold Coast.

0:51 0:54 FEMALE: There are a lot of students too.  I have two cousins who went there for university.  

0:54 0:55 MALE: Oh really?

0:54 0:57 FEMALE: One is there right now.  I [unintelligible] remember Melbourne or something.

0:56 0:58 MALE: Young people go there to have fun I think.  When there's--

0:59 1:00 FEMALE: It rains all the time, I heard.  Is it true?  

1:00 1:01 MALE: No.

1:00 1:03 FEMALE: It's like rain and, and a little bit cold?

1:04 1:08 MALE: No, it's nice.  It's really nice.  I actually worked in Singapore for a couple of years.

1:08 1:09 FEMALE: You're kidding.

1:09 1:10 MALE: No.

1:10 1:11 FEMALE: Which company were you working for?

1:11 1:12 MALE: McKenzie there, yeah.

1:13 1:18 FEMALE: McKenzie [unintelligible]?  So I mean are you--so you had work in-- 

1:18 1:19 MALE: I worked--

1:18 1:20 FEMALE: Australia as a McKenzie consultant?

1:20 1:21 MALE: Yeah.  

1:21 1:22 FEMALE: And then moved to Singapore?

1:22 1:27 MALE: Well, I worked there, and then--I worked over--I didn't work there very often, but for a long period of time.

1:28 1:29 FEMALE: Oh.

1:29 1:31 MALE: There and Hong Kong and India.

1:31 1:32 FEMALE: That's awesome.

1:32 1:33 MALE: And Australia.

1:33 1:34 FEMALE: It was a very Asian experience then.

1:34 1:37 MALE: Yeah.  I didn't learn any Asian languages, but--

1:38 1:39 FEMALE: Chinese is rough.

1:39 1:40 MALE: Well, Singapore was easy--

1:40 1:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:40 1:41 MALE: 'Cause everyone spoke English there.

1:41 1:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  Hong Kong, I think--I mean, I'm Chinese, and I speak Mandarin, but even when I go to Hong Kong, I can barely understand, because, you know, it might be a Chinese dialect, but that doesn't mean that they, they transfer, so--

1:51 1:52 MALE: Yeah.  

1:52 1:55 FEMALE: And Hong Kong is too congested for me.  Did you--did you like Singapore or--?

1:56 1:58 MALE: I liked--it was a little um--

1:59 2:01 FEMALE: Sort of boring after Melbourne, right?  [laughter].

2:00 2:08 MALE: Well, yeah, boring, and kind of--like, when I heard that the government pays the street musicians, sometimes, to, like be there.

2:08 2:09 FEMALE: Is that true?

2:09 2:10 MALE: Apparently so.

2:10 2:12 FEMALE: I didn't know that.  What, where are you getting--?

2:12 2:13 MALE: Yeah so it's a little too ordered for me.

2:12 2:14 FEMALE: Where are you getting this info from, my goodness?

2:15 2:17 MALE: I don't know.  Maybe it's a horrible rumor, but I heard it from quite a few people.

2:17 2:21 FEMALE: Just like a lot of people in America think that you can't chew gum in Singapore.  You know that's not true, right?

2:21 2:22 MALE: I did not know that.

2:22 2:45 FEMALE: Yes, you can definitely chew as much gum as you like.  The, the law was against selling gum because they, they revoked the licenses to sell gum, because they thought it was a public nuisance, after some vandals gummed the train station doors together.  So because of those isolated incidents, they decided no gum selling for the rest of--which was definitely a crazy move.  They, they've gotten smarter about it now.  I think they're revoking that, that law.

2:46 2:52 MALE: Wow.  I don't know whether I'll be back there again.  See, I'm actually moving to, to the U.S. after I finish school.

2:53 2:54 FEMALE: Right.  Are you going to work for McKenzie again or--?  

2:54 2:55 MALE: Yeah.  

2:55 2:58 FEMALE: Consulting's your life work, huh?

2:58 3:01 MALE: No, I don't know about that, but they paid, they paid for my tuition, so I mean--

3:01 3:03 FEMALE: Oh how does that work?  Do they give scholarships too?

3:03 3:04 MALE: Yeah.  

3:04 3:05 FEMALE: I didn't know that.  

3:04 3:05 MALE: Yeah.  

3:05 3:10 FEMALE: That's awesome.  That would be the kind of scholarship I'd want to get.  I, I'm actually on--taking a scholarship under the Singapore government.

3:10 3:11 MALE: Okay.  

3:11 3:12 FEMALE: So they pay my education.  

3:12 3:14 MALE: So you have to go back then afterwards?  When do you finish?

3:14 3:15 FEMALE: I finish this June.

3:15 3:16 MALE: Oh wow.

3:16 3:19 FEMALE: So I will probably be back in Singapore by July or, or August.

3:19 3:25 MALE: So it's going to be hard for you to meet, like, a uh potential husband or something here.

3:25 3:30 FEMALE: [unintelligible] whatever.  I'm 23.  Whatever potential--I mean, well, no, if things happen it happens.

3:30 3:31 MALE: Yeah.  

3:31 3:33 FEMALE: But I'm not, like, I'm not real nervous or anything.

3:33 3:36 MALE: So tell me one, tell me one thing that you're really passionate about.

3:37 3:44 FEMALE: Me?  I like music.  I sing and I play the piano too.  I think those, I don't know, those two things bring me most instinctive enjoyment.  

3:44 3:45 MALE: Oh wow.

3:45 3:46 FEMALE: What about yourself?

3:46 3:51 MALE: I would have to say I travel a lot.  I really enjoy meeting different people.

3:50 3:52 FEMALE: Okay where have you not been?

3:52 3:55 MALE: I've not been to Africa, but I'm going to solve that.

3:53 3:55 FEMALE: I've been to South Africa.

3:56 3:57 MALE: I'm going to go there this summer, so.

3:57 3:58 FEMALE: [unintelligible].

3:58 3:59 MALE: But I yeah, I pretty much have been everywhere.

4:00 4:02 FEMALE: No kidding.  Everywhere except South Africa.  Wow.

4:03 4:04 MALE: Well I haven't been to Antarctica either.  So.

4:06 4:08 FEMALE: Which doesn't count, I mean, how many people actually get to Antarctica. 

4:08 4:12 MALE: I got close.  I got to the very southern tip of South, [horn]South America, but--

4:14 4:15 FEMALE: That's awesome.

4:15 4:16 MALE: That's a trip for another day.

4:15 4:16 FEMALE: Yeah.  

4:16 4:17 MALE: Nice to meet you female230.

4:17 4:18 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
