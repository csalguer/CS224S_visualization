0:00 0:03 MALE:  Have to do that twice as fast next time.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Okay, are you done?  Alright.
0:05 0:06 MALE:  Okay.
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:07 0:08 MALE:  Hi, How's it going?
0:07 0:10 FEMALE:  [laughter] this is so funny [laughter].
0:09 0:10 MALE:  I know, this is so speedy.
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  I'm female239.
0:11 0:12 MALE:  female239, how's it going?  I'm male218.
0:11 0:13 FEMALE:  Hi male218.  male218?
0:13 0:14 MALE:  How's it going?
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  Good.
0:15 0:16 MALE:  Wow,  that was pretty fast.
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:17 0:18 MALE:  So what is it, what is it that you do here?
0:18 0:22 FEMALE:  Okay, so, I'm a, I should like prepare this like 10 seconds.  I'm a master's student.
0:21 0:24 MALE:  Right, exactly, write on the hand or something.
0:23 0:27 FEMALE:  I know.  Uh, master's student, first year and I'm in product design.
0:28 0:29 MALE:  Product design, so that's like...
0:29 0:33 FEMALE:  It's like uh, I, it's like aesthetics; it's like art and engineering together.
0:33 0:38 MALE:  I think I met somebody who was in product design one time.  He was doing something with cars and he was like trying to put those two together.
0:37 0:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's, it's a very creative major.  It's very broad in the fact that like, people come from all sorts of different areas and then we just do whatever we want to do.
0:43 0:49 MALE: I can imagine.  Oh, so is it a little bit like architecture in that it takes a lot of technical skills but also like creativity?
0:49 0:56 FEMALE:  Not really technical it's like, it's like making stuff.  It's like, a big component is going out and finding needs and then designing a product for that need.
0:56 0:58 MALE:  Oh, okay bada [phonetic] bing [phonetic] bada boom.
0:57 1:04 FEMALE:  So, right now, I'm doing like, I'm doing like a bike riding in the rain.  So I'm going to, I talked to many people and I think about their needs and then I design stuff.
1:04 1:06 MALE:  About how to design it, oh that's interesting.
1:06 1:08 FEMALE:  It's nice to make it, there's a lab there and we...
1:08 1:15 MALE:  Yeah, I have a bike that's from Finland.  I'm not sure how it came here from Finland but it's like one of the best bikes I've ever had in the rain.
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Yeah?
1:15 1:21 MALE:  Yeah, it's got these like great little shields over the wheels.  Like how they designed it, it's called Tuntudish [phonetic].  You may be look in.
1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  Really?  Cool.
1:21 1:23 MALE:  Yeah, because it's, so some interesting ideas and I've never really seen that.
1:23 1:25 FEMALE:  Are they thicker wheels or thinner wheels, because?
1:25 1:32 MALE:  They're sort of in the middle, like it's, and it looks like a tire that I don't think I could ever have replaced here, which is going to be a problem. It's a great bike in the rain.
1:32 1:33 FEMALE:  You still use it now?
1:33 1:35 MALE:  I use it now, yeah and it's been great at Stanford so far.
1:35 1:39 FEMALE:  I'm doing this project where it's like covers your hands because uh, people don't like wearing gloves and...
1:39 1:41 MALE:  That's a good one too, that's a good one too.
1:40 1:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, so, yeah.  I'm still working on that.  It's supposed to be raining sometime this week, so, if you'd like to be a user test on it [laughter]...
1:46 1:48 MALE:  [laughter] with the new gloves?
1:48 1:51 FEMALE:  But their not gloves they're like little shields that go over your hands.
1:51 1:57 MALE:  That's interesting, that's interesting.  Um, can, and they still have like complete movement too, like when you're like riding around?
1:56 2:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, they kind of, they just kind of, um, shield them.  So they're like a flexible material that shields them.
2:02 2:03 MALE:  Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.
2:03 2:04 FEMALE:  What about you?
2:04 2:14 MALE:  I, uh, I'm a third year in Slavic languages and literature.  So um, I teach Russian second year  here right now and I also do Russian literature.
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  Wow.
2:15 2:18 MALE:  I do like various, various Slavic languages and also did some German.
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  Is that a PhD program?
2:20 2:21 MALE:  PhD program, usually takes us like seven yeears.
2:21 2:22 FEMALE:  Wow.
2:22 2:30 MALE:  So, I'm a third on the way to seven.  It takes; it takes a while in our program.  Like no one, in theory people should finish in five, no one, no one ever finishes in five unfortunately.
2:30 2:32 FEMALE:  Hum, are you from Russia or?
2:32 2:41 MALE:  My family came from Russia way back when.  Um, but, my parents didn't speak any Russian and I just sort of, my grandma did though, so probably something through that.
2:41 2:42 FEMALE:  So you picked it up through her?
2:43 3:01 MALE:  I picked a little bit through her and then also I had been studying, I've been studying like Latin and Spanish when I was younger.  I wanted to do something just completely different.  I sort of felt like, it sort of like you study French for example, like its sort of seems like you really know what's going to happen when you go to Paris.  You know, it just seems very planned and it's not like going to Russia, it seemed like very unplanned like.
3:00 3:04 FEMALE:  Huh, cool, that's great.  That's really, that's, I think knowing a lot of languages is really key.
3:05 3:06 MALE:  It's pretty fun, yeah, it's like...
3:06 3:08 FEMALE:  You know, so what other ones are you fluent in or?
3:08 3:19 MALE:  Uh, I know a little bit of German, little of Spanish, Surbo [phonetic] Croatian is one that I'm, that I'm pretty strong, not too, I mean the Russians seeps in and starts replacing it.  Do you do?
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  Very similar?
3:19 3:22 MALE:  Yeah, that's one of the, it's good, but it's also a big problem.
3:22 3:23 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:23 3:24 MALE:  Do you do any other languages?
3:24 3:26 FEMALE:  Well, I uh, speak Mandarin, so.
3:27 3:28 MALE:  That's a good language to know.
3:28 3:31 FEMALE: Yeah, my parents taught me that.  And my, I know a little bit of Cantonese, but.
3:31 3:37 MALE:  Uh-huh.  A little, a little Cantonese, I have, I've been to Hong Kong, so I picked up a little, tiny bit of Cantonese.
3:37 3:38 FEMALE:  Oh, that's a tough one though.
3:38 3:44 MALE:  It was, yeah, it was, it was um, a pretty big disaster.  Even apparently the little Cantonese I had had a strong Russian accent.
3:44 3:45 FEMALE:  [laughter]
3:45 3:50 MALE:  It sometimes happens like if you know a second language, and other language you do after that gets the accent of the second language.
3:50 3:51 FEMALE:  Oh, interesting.
3:51 3:54 MALE:  Right, so it's a, it's very funny thing.
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  Do you think in Russian or?
3:55 3:56 MALE:  Sometimes, yeah.
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  Really?
3:57 4:03 MALE:  Yeah, I, I lived there; I lived in Moscow and Petersburg for probably three years of the last six or seven.  So I spent a lot of time up there.
4:03 4:05 FEMALE:  Wow, that's pretty great.
4:04 4:09 MALE:  Yeah, even right now I spend a good deal of time in Moscow, most [unintelligible].
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  Okay.
4:09 4:10 MALE:  female239, it was really nice to meet you.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  Well, hey, you too.
4:11 4:12 MALE:  Take care, have a good rest of the night.
4:12 4:13 FEMALE:  Oh, well, thank you.
4:13 4:14 MALE:  And good luck with the bicycles.
4:14 4:16 FEMALE:  [laughter] oh, alright.
4:14 4:15 MALE:  Remember Tuntudish.
