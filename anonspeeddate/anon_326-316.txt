1:24 1:28 MALE: I am in the business school.  So was that obvious or?
1:28 1:31 FEMALE: A little [laughter].  I hang out with engineers all the time, so.
1:31 1:32 MALE: Really?  You guessed?
1:32 1:32 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:32 1:34 MALE: Really?  So you're obviously an engineering student?
1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Uh, material science.  Yeah.
1:36 1:36 MALE: Material science?
1:37 1:37 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:37 1:38 MALE: So what does material science mean?
1:39 1:39 FEMALE: Um--
1:39 1:39 MALE: Like rocks and--
1:40 1:43 FEMALE: No, that's geology [laughter].  Um, material science is kind of into semi-conductors and things.
1:44 1:46 MALE: Oh yeah?  Awesome.
1:46 1:48 FEMALE: Solar cells, clean technology, fuel cells.  It's kind of my big thing.
1:49 1:50 MALE: Okay.  What's your like specific interest?

2:03 2:05 MALE: We actually played them.  We met a whole group of them at--you know [unintelligible]? 
2:07 2:07 FEMALE: I do not [laughter].
2:08 2:12 MALE: No.  We met a whole group of engineering and master's students that played dodge ball this fall.
2:13 2:13 FEMALE: Oh cool.
2:13 2:20 MALE: So they were--uh, I threw out my arm several times.  Besides that, it was a good time.  But they were like, Oh yeah.  We're all like [unintelligible] students.

2:47 2:48 MALE: Did you like MIT?
2:48 2:51 FEMALE: Um, well I liked academics.
2:52 2:52 MALE: Yeah.
2:52 2:54 FEMALE: 'Cause it's pretty--it's very rigorou
2:55 2:55 MALE: Do you like Boston?
2:55 3:00 FEMALE: But um, people in the social scene are a little not so.
3:00 3:01 MALE: Leave something to be desired?
3:01 3:11 FEMALE: A little scary, yeah [laughter].  But Boston itself was awesome, just 'cause there were all the BU kids, BC kids, like all these--just college town.
3:11 3:13 MALE: Yeah.  There are just tons and tons of schools right in [unintelligible].
3:13 3:14 FEMALE: So it was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  A lot of stuff to do on the weekend.
3:15 3:19 MALE: So where, uh, where do you want to be?  Do you want to remain out in California or you want to go back East?
3:19 3:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  I want to stay here.  So my family's here.
3:21 3:25 MALE: So what's the difference between like Stanford and MIT?  Like Stanford's much more social, you think?
3:25 3:27 FEMALE: I think it's just kind of missing the fuzzies.
3:28 3:29 MALE: Missing the what?
3:29 3:33 FEMALE: The fuzzies, like the non-hard core techies types.
3:33 3:33 MALE: Oh.  Okay.
3:33 3:36 FEMALE: So MIT, a lot of people just kind of go way off the deep end.
3:37 3:37 MALE: Really?
3:38 3:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.
3:40 3:43 MALE: Wow.  So how did you decide to go to MIT?  Just thought it'd be a good school? Interested in math?
3:45 3:49 FEMALE: Yeah.  I like Boston a lot.  And also, [unintelligible] engineering is the way to go.  They're good at that, so.
3:50 3:51 MALE: Wow.
3:51 3:51 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:51 3:58 MALE: So you want to do--when you're done, do you want to do when you're done, do you want to do like research on solar cells or solar power?  Or do you want to like go work for a company?  Or what's the--
3:58 4:01 FEMALE: Yeah.  Actually, I interviewed at Google this morning.
4:02 4:02 MALE: Really?
4:02 4:02 FEMALE: For marketing.
4:03 4:03 MALE: Yeah?
4:04 4:04 FEMALE: Yeah.
