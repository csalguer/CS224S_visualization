0:02 0:05 FEMALE: I should be able to just move my name tag. 
0:14 0:17 MALE: I feel like a storm trooper or something carrying this thing. It's nice to meet you by the way.
0:10 0:11 FEMALE: It's good to meet you, too.
0:19 0:19 MALE: Is that a Swatch?
0:12 0:12 FEMALE: It is a swatch.
0:21 0:21 MALE: Nice.
0:15 0:16 FEMALE: What? My sister got it for me from Greece?
0:24 0:24 MALE: Oh really?
0:18 0:18 FEMALE: It's my California watch.
0:26 0:26 MALE: Why is that?
0:21 0:21 FEMALE: It has hibiscus.
0:29 0:29 MALE: Oh. Like the tea.
0:24 0:24 FEMALE: Oh. I suppose.
0:32 0:32 MALE: Have you ever had hibiscus tea? 
0:26 0:26 FEMALE: I have not but...
0:33 0:33 MALE: It's good.
0:27 0:27 FEMALE: ...I've heard of it.
0:34 0:38 MALE: I recommend it. I haven't seen a Swatch since like first or second grade.
0:32 0:32 FEMALE: What are you saying?
0:39 0:40 MALE: But they're in all airports now. What?
0:35 0:35 FEMALE: No, I said what are you saying?
0:43 0:45 MALE: I'm not saying your interests, your styles are derivative.
0:40 0:40 FEMALE: Mmm, like a first grader.
0:49 0:51 MALE: No. That's not what I'm saying. [laughter]
0:43 0:43 FEMALE: No, I know. I'm just kidding.
0:51 0:53 MALE: I often pass that-- have you seen the store in SFO?
0:46 0:46 FEMALE: No, I haven't.
0:54 0:56 MALE: They have a big store next to them.
0:50 0:53 FEMALE: I did just go to the mall here, though, and they have a Swatch store.
0:59 1:00 MALE: Oh, they do?
0:55 0:55 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:02 1:03 MALE: Stanford Shopping Center?
0:55 0:55 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:04 1:04 MALE: Where is it?
0:59 1:13 FEMALE: It's across from Macy's. I have a horrendous sense of direction but I think I came out of Swatch and went to Macys. I actually have three watches and all of the batteries died in a slow progression so I finally went and got one of them.
1:19 1:23 MALE: Is that why you're grinding your sister's present or us that your first choice?
1:15 1:17 FEMALE: No, this was part of the mix, it was part of the rotation.
1:24 1:25 MALE: Oh. Okay.
1:21 1:23 FEMALE: It was the last soldier to fall and the easiest one to replace the battery.
1:30 1:32 MALE: Is your sister older or younger?
1:26 1:26 FEMALE: She's older.
1:34 1:36 MALE: Did she go to the Olympics or something?
1:30 1:30 FEMALE: No.
1:38 1:38 MALE: So she bought it in Greece?
1:32 1:42 FEMALE: Oh. Her husband's Greek so they've been to Greece a couple of times. It's funny you ask me. She did go to the Olympics in Atlanta. Not as an Olympian but as a journalist so I was thrown off.
1:48 1:48 MALE: She's a journalist?
1:44 1:44 FEMALE: Yeah. She works for 60 Minutes.
1:52 1:54 MALE: Cool. Do you help her dig up stories?	
1:47 1:49 FEMALE: No. I'm not nearly interesting enough--
1:56 1:56 MALE: Speed dating on the campus. 
1:51 1:54 FEMALE: Yeah, exactly. Nerd dating at Stanford.
2:01 2:02 MALE: What do you study here?
1:56 1:56 FEMALE: Education.
2:04 2:05 MALE: There's a lot of education girls here.
1:59 2:00 FEMALE: Yeah. It's an education study.
2:07 2:08 MALE: A lot of B school guys here.

2:10 2:10 MALE: Yeah. I am.
2:04 2:04 FEMALE: Okay.

2:30 2:31 FEMALE: No. I grew up in New Jersey.
2:38 2:39 MALE: Oh. I went to Princeton.	
2:33 2:33 FEMALE: Oh. You did?
2:41 2:41 MALE: Yeah.
2:35 2:35 FEMALE: That's like the nicest town in New Jersey.
2:44 2:45 MALE: It's pretty nice, yeah.
2:38 2:45 FEMALE: Well I said in New Jersey. Princeton's lovely though, actually. Is it kind of boring to go to school there? Are there like any bars or...?
2:51 2:57 MALE: It's really what I'm looking for. It's definitely insulated.
2:50 2:51 FEMALE: It's not a party school at all, is it?
2:58 3:07 MALE: I kind of like that. I like to go to small campuses that are very inclusive. But by the end I was definitely sort of... You can take the train into New York in 40 minutes.
3:00 3:00 FEMALE: That's true.
3:08 3:08 MALE: Where did you grow up in New Jersey?

3:19 3:19 MALE: Yeah.
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: I used to go bowling there.	
3:22 3:25 MALE: I've been there like once. Tell me, is it like a happening town?
3:20 3:20 FEMALE: You've only been to Manville once?
3:28 3:28 MALE: Yeah. 
3:22 3:24 FEMALE: Didn't you drive by your dad's old house, see his high school?
3:29 3:38 MALE: I would drive by the exit and I'd see the right hand turn to Manville going home and I was always like, no. All I know is they had like some big asbestos factory there was that involved in some famous litigation case.
3:30 3:38 FEMALE: Yeah. Johns of Manville, my uncle died of cancer from working there. Everybody who worked there died of lung cancer.
3:45 3:45 MALE: Oh really?
3:40 3:41 FEMALE: Yeah. It's called Johns of Manville, it's a big...
3:46 3:49 MALE: Yeah. I don't know much about it.
3:43 3:45 FEMALE: That's pretty much all there is to know. [laughter]
3:52 3:52 MALE: About Manville?
3:47 3:49 FEMALE: No, not about Manville. About the Johns.
3:54 3:55 MALE: Oh. Come on. Oh. About the case?
3:50 3:52 FEMALE: Yeah. Manville, I never really went that much--

3:56 3:56 FEMALE: I think so.
4:02 4:03 MALE: It's hard to leave.
