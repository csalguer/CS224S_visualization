0:06 0:10 MALE: Uh, I'm a PhD student in electrical engineering.  So...

0:10 0:10 FEMALE: What's your focus?

0:12 0:13 MALE: Uh, I do like ultrasound imaging.

0:14 0:17 FEMALE:  Ultrasound imaging.  I know someone who does MRI imaging.  Is that at all similar?

0:19 0:20 MALE: Uh, it's not a lot -

0:19 0:20 FEMALE: Different technology.

0:22 0:23 MALE: Yeah, [unintelligible] -- do you know who he works for, Nishimura's [phonetic] group?

0:22 0:22 FEMALE: No.

0:22 0:28 MALE: Oh, yeah, that's uh, that's pretty different in terms of like the technology but I mean it's medical imaging, so -

0:28 0:28 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:29 0:31 MALE: It's kind of the same stuff, so, yeah.

0:30 0:31 FEMALE: What year are you?

0:32 0:34 MALE: Um, in my sixth year.

0:33 0:33 FEMALE: Almost done?

0:35 0:47 MALE: Uh, that's like - yeah, I'm going to be here -- I haven't like had an official conversation with my adviser about it, but um, probably in December or next winter.

0:46 0:47 FEMALE: What are you going to do then?

0:49 0:59 MALE: Uh, I'll probably -- um, I'm not sure.  I mean, I want to try to see -- I mean I'd like to go do a -- like a Post-Doc.

0:57 0:57 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

0:59 1:14 MALE: You know, in something sort of related to this, maybe switch skills a little bit, or try to find some kind of like small company, you know, try to do something with, you know, uh, some of the research I did, you know, like start a company with some people I know, something like that.

1:12 1:12 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:16 1:17 MALE: So, yeah.  I'm not sure yet, but I'm just trying to like do a good job -

1:16 1:16 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:19 1:22 MALE: - in what I'm doing now, and see what opportunities there are.

1:20 1:20 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:22 1:23 MALE: So how about you, what department are you in?

1:23 1:25 FEMALE: Uh, I'm first PhD in the Slavic department.

1:26 1:26 MALE: Oh, okay.

1:26 1:26 FEMALE: Russian literature.

1:27 1:27 MALE: Cool.

1:27 1:30 FEMALE: So yeah, I'm just starting out.  Got a long ways ahead of me.

1:32 1:33 MALE: So how do you like Stanford?

1:33 1:47 FEMALE: I like it a lot, it's great.  I, um, I'm from Oregon originally, so it's really nice to be close to home.  I, uh, love the weather, it's nice.  I have family in the area.  So, it's pretty ideal for me.  I like it a lot.

1:48 1:56 MALE: Yeah, it's -- I mean, Oregon I think is -- well, actually, I've never been to Oregon, but I'm guessing it's a lot like -- similar kind of attitude as here, right?

1:55 2:14 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah, I mean it's -- you know, the only thing I don't like here is how -- I mean, there's so many people.  The population density is so high, and uh, lots of -- I'm not a big fan of all the traffic, but other than that, it's great.  And uh, yeah, around here at least -- I expected to come down here and just kind of be in shorts and a tank-top year-round, and it's actually been -

2:16 2:16 MALE: Yeah.

2:15 2:21 FEMALE: - you know, I tell myself that I'm just disappointed that it gets cold so often, but it's also -- actually I think it's nice.  I think I'd get sick of it if it was hot all the time.

2:22 2:22 MALE: Yeah.

2:22 2:28 FEMALE: And uh -- and the greenery, like the springtime is really beautiful, so, that reminds me of home.  Where are you from originally?

2:29 2:31 MALE: You haven't been here in the summer, right?  

2:30 2:34 FEMALE:  No.  Well, I got here last September and it was in the 90s when I got here, and that was pretty intense, but -

2:35 2:39 MALE: Yeah, and it's like -- that's like there's just one -- I mean usually it's a couple of weeks it gets really hot and -

2:38 2:38 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:40 2:45 MALE: The weather here's -- you'll get used to it, I'm sure [unintelligible].

2:43 2:46 FEMALE: Yeah, I can't complain.  [laughter].  Where are you from originally?

2:48 2:56 MALE: I'm from -- I mean, mostly from -- well I guess the seven years before I came here I was in Wyoming, but um, I also lived a little bit in Colorado.

2:54 2:54 FEMALE: What'd you do in Wyoming?

2:57 3:11 MALE: I mean just went to school.  I mean, yeah.  I was there for junior high school, high school, and I did my undergrad at University of Wyoming. So -- yeah, so I can, I know where you're coming from, and the population density.

3:08 3:08 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

3:12 3:19 MALE: It's not so bad here, I mean, it's pretty easy to live in Palo Alto, it's not like -- it's definitely not like the big city or like -

3:15 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm usually not much of a fan of suburb kind of areas, but I like it here.  Like San Francisco is so urban.

3:26 3:26 MALE: Mm-hmm.

3:24 3:32 FEMALE:  And it feels a little overwhelming.  Like Portland is very -- I mean it's a decent-sized city, but it's just not the same at all.  People aren't like stacked on top of each other like they are in San Francisco.

3:36 3:36 MALE: Right.

3:34 3:35 FEMALE: So, yeah, I like being out here.

3:39 3:43 MALE: So what kind of stuff do you like to do in the city?  Have you been to the city much?

3:42 4:03 FEMALE: I go -- I don't have a car, so it kind of depends on what, you know, friends are doing.  I just went last Saturday to some bar where they were having some like queer cabaret thing, like performances, and I went to a comedy club show, I've gone and wandered around with a friend who came to visit, um, I mean I'm sure there's so much that I haven't even seen yet, but...

4:03 4:03 [Background Noise]

4:05 4:05 FEMALE: Anyway.

4:06 4:06 MALE: All right.  It was nice to meet you.

4:06 4:06 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
