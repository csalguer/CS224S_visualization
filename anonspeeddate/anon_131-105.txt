0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:02 0:02 MALE:  Hi.
0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  I'm female131.  
0:03 0:04 MALE:  male105 [unintelligible].  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  male105 [unintelligible].  
0:05 0:12 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  Uhm, I'm trying to come up with a different question.  How did you end up coming here tonight?  
0:13 0:15 FEMALE:  Well, I actually answer two questions.  
0:16 0:16 MALE:  Okay.  
0:16 0:37 FEMALE:  All my friends go to law school.  Actually, one of my friends, when he wasn't a student yet found females who were living in studio three in Escondito Village.  And we also were talking about how many [unintelligible].  So, they planned to go, and I'm one of those people that if all my friends are going, I'll go too.  
0:37 0:38 MALE:  [laughter]  
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  Well, they're going to go meet people.  
0:39 0:40 MALE:  That poor guy.  That sounds odd.  
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, and what about you?  
0:43 1:03 MALE:  Uh, one of my friends is a journalism major, and he did a report on the one that happened in EV a while back.  And so we're like, ah, okay.  And so talking to a couple of other friends like we should do this so we know what it's all about.  And so organized a couple of us to come out, and here we are.  It's kind of fun.  
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  Yeah, and you know [unintelligible].  
1:05 1:13 MALE:  Yeah.  I didn't know what to expect.  I hadn't been to anything like this before.  It was a little kind of confusing at the start, but I don't know.  It's cool.  
1:14 1:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And everybody seems like they're really nice people.  I like--you know, if I walk away and like meet like a couple of other people that I just want to hang out with.  
1:22 1:23 MALE:  Right.  
1:23 1:28 FEMALE:  That would be more than I get like going to downtown Palo Alto on a Thursday night.  
1:28 1:37 MALE:  I know.  I know, and like a lot of people tend to be so closed in here.  Like meeting people who are friendly and you can just talk to is really nice.  
1:38 1:43 FEMALE: I'm sad that there's only four minutes and like you actually have to go in a circle, no [unintelligible] people.  
1:43 1:43 MALE:  I know.  
1:46 1:46 FEMALE:  But [unintelligible] to make sense.  
1:47 1:51 MALE:  Well, and a lot of times you're in the middle of a conversation.  It's like, it's nice talking to you.  
1:51 1:55 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's really talking about your life dreams, and, oh, catch you later.  
1:57 1:58 MALE:  Yep, yep.  
1:58 2:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, and it's not really the most romantic way to meet somebody.  What department are you from?  
2:04 2:09 MALE: Mechanical engineering.  Like pretty much most everyone here is some kind of engineer.  
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
2:10 2:10 MALE:  What about you?  
2:11 2:12 FEMALE:  Law school.  
2:12 2:15 MALE:  Law school, right on.  What kind of law do you want to practice?  
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  I actually want to do civil rights.  
2:18 2:18 MALE:  Nice.  
2:18 2:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, so maybe [unintelligible] a lot of material motions. [unintelligible] people hey, they discriminate against race, and religion and-
2:28 2:29 MALE:  Cool. 
2:30 2:31 FEMALE:  That's it.  
2:31 2:31 MALE:  That's kind of fun.  
2:31 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:32 2:35 MALE:  Have you gotten used to the different schedule that the lawschool keeps?  
2:36 2:44 FEMALE:  Well, you know, I think I've always been [unintelligible], and in fact there is a big debate at the law school about should [unintelligible]?  
2:45 2:46 MALE:  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  
2:48 2:56 FEMALE:  People are up in arms.  Like you would just not believe how [unintelligible] they want people to get [unintelligible] who can be like negative.  
2:57 3:00 MALE:  And you guys argue.  So-
3:00 3:03 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yes, right, and [unintelligible].  
3:04 3:06 MALE:  And say you start changing things for them.  
3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:07 3:19 MALE:  I think the worst part about it is if you have a professor who is not used to the quarter system and all of the sudden they try to cram everything in a semester into a quarter.  Then it gets kind of fuzzy and-
3:20 3:31 FEMALE:  But, I mean, do you guys have a lot of visiting professors that come?  You would think that once they've been here for a while they would kind of [unintelligible], and they recognize [unintelligible].  
3:32 3:43 MALE:  Oh, no.  I have had one professor in the fall who said you know we're losing one lecture because of Thanksgiving this year so I've scheduled an extra one on a Friday this week.  So-
3:44 3:47 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, we have a lot of professors that pull that too all the time.  
3:47 4:00 MALE:  You're like what?  I know.  So, and his argument was--you know what he [unintelligible] on the first day of class.  He's like if you guys can't make it, or if you have a problem with it, don't take the class this quarter.  
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  I wish you had let us know that before.  
4:04 4:06 MALE:  Yeah.  It was nice talking to you, female131.  Have a good one.
