0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I know.  
0:15 0:21 MALE:  Then again like if you gave people like a half hour, they probably wouldn't still be done.  I don't know.  Yeah, cool.  What program are you in?  
0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  I'm in education.  I'm doctoral.

0:24 0:24 FEMALE:  First year.  
0:26 0:27 MALE:  Okay, how is it going so far?  
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  Good, busy.  
0:28 0:30 MALE:  Yeah, I'm a third year in political science.
0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  Oh, really.  
0:31 0:35 MALE:  It's kind of like all my friends who are first years are like it's got to be easier like to get through.  I'm like, no.  
0:34 0:39 FEMALE:  No, no, no I've got to tell you I'm a political science refugee.  I'm in poli sci [unintelligible].  
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Please explain why you have to leave. 
0:40 0:43 FEMALE:  I was in the graduate program at UW Madison.  
0:45 0:45 MALE:  Okay. 
0:44 0:51 FEMALE:  And doing European Union Integration, and my advisor moved to Florence, and then my other advisor got [unintelligible].  
0:52 0:54 MALE:  What year?  Who was your advisor at W Madison?  
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  nameX and nameX [phonetic].  
0:56 0:59 MALE:  Okay, okay, I've heard those names before, yeah.  Oh, okay.  
0:59 1:08 FEMALE:  And then I got really interested in like college teaching and like I'm like studying teaching of undergraduates.  And so now I'm like way into research on teaching.  
1:10 1:15 MALE:  Wow, so does that mean you want to be a professor while you teach undergraduates, or a professor but also research the teaching on [unintelligible].  
1:15 1:17 FEMALE:  More researcher, but I do want to stay in academia.  
1:18 1:28 MALE:  Okay, oh cool.  Do most people in the program want to become professors, or is it sort of just completely dependent on random.  Like they want to be--do some want to [unintelligible] administration?  
1:28 1:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, it depends on kind of what fields.  You know, like the higher ed--that's like the part I'm in, and they put--like the higher ed people will only admit people who really want to be a professor.  
1:39 1:40 MALE: Right, okay.  
1:39 1:44 FEMALE:  But then in like the policy area there are more people who want to be administrators, or researchers outside.  
1:46 1:51 MALE:  Right, yeah, and it's good so far like despite the work and stuff.  
1:50 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, actually it's really different than in the disciplines like because it's--you know, it's interdisciplinary, and it's like--it's less like theoretical.  
2:00 2:00 MALE:  Right, right. 
1:59 2:00 FEMALE: And so I'm constantly trying to bring in theories, and they're constantly like, no, no, no no theory.  
2:05 2:19 MALE:  No, no, no, no, right, right.  The same thing is [unintelligible].  There are people like who come from [unintelligible] or something [unintelligible].  Like, I was going to [unintelligible].  This is how it works.  I'm like no, no, no we're not just going to like, you know, your story is [unintelligible] for any kind of like theory of politics and stuff.  
2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  Right.  
2:20 2:30 MALE:  So, it will be like--I think it will be that's what grad school is like.  You get more work with every year, but you get better and better at managing like what's important.  That's what we have to start teaching this so I don't get the TA eventually.  
2:30 2:34 FEMALE:  I don't have to [unintelligible] the program.  I want to though.  [crosstalk]  
2:36 2:37 MALE:  I like TA's.  [unintelligible] is just--it's just a lot of time.  
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  It is.  
2:39 2:44 MALE:  Like to do a decent job you sort of like--you have to sort of spend a lot of time doing it I think.  
2:44 2:44 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:45 2:47 MALE:  It's time you can't do--figure out to do other stuff.  
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  So, who do you work with?  
2:48 2:58 MALE: Do you know a woman in [unintelligible], Isabella Marrs [unintelligible], a little bit, mainly Isabella though.  It's a really nice--mainly Isabella, yeah.  It's a great [unintelligible].  I mean I got extra allotted.

3:01 3:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] question to ask.  
3:01 3:03 FEMALE: Okay, never mind, never mind.  
3:04 3:06 MALE:  It's more actually European policy.
