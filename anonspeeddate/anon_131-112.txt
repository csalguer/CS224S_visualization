0:41 1:05 MALE:  Well, see that's was interesting because the questions are almost in reversal.  They ask what would I study, which HI I am in, and where I'm from, but then there was on very [unintelligible] who asked what is my favorite food and what is my favorite animal, which I had a hard time to answer because I didn't know really what food or animal.

1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  Where did you grow up?  
1:52 1:57 MALE:  I am from Korea, yeah.  Probably we didn't have these teddy grahams.
