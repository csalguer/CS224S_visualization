0:00:56.1 0:00:56.8 MALE:  Maybe from the-
0:00:55.8 0:01:01.1 FEMALE:  Because I remember they did some really cool projects about like technology-
0:01:00.8 0:01:03.5 MALE:  Maybe there was a- a [unintelligible] master's students. 
0:01:03.5 0:01:05.0 FEMALE:  Probably.

0:01:07.4 0:01:08.2 MALE:  We mix a lot.  
0:01:08.3 0:01:08.9 FEMALE:  Oh you do?
0:01:08.1 0:01:09.3 MALE:  I know all of them, yeah.  
0:01:09.2 0:01:09.8 FEMALE:  Oh cool.
0:01:09.3 0:01:12.2 MALE:  I think Shirley might have been in your class.  Shirley and--

0:01:17.8 0:01:20.4 MALE:  And Imra- Evan was in the class, I think.  
0:01:20.6 0:01:21.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:20.2 0:01:24.2 MALE:  Evan, Evan was also, yeah.  So, yeah, I know those people really well.
0:01:24.3 0:01:26.1 FEMALE:  So how do you like being in the school of ed?
0:01:26.3 0:01:30.4 MALE:  I like it a lot, actually.  I love Stanford more than the school of ed, I guess.  
0:01:30.5 0:01:31.7 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:01:31.9 0:01:32.9 MALE:  Yeah, I like being here. 
0:01:31.8 0:01:33.3 FEMALE:  And what- what's the difference?
0:01:34.6 0:01:41.0 MALE:  Overall Stanford has a lot of opportunities to do a lot of stuff, even research wise and just living here is better.  
0:01:41.2 0:01:41.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:41.2 0:01:54.7 MALE:  School of Ed- the kind of work that I do, I don't have a lot of people who do similar work.  So I don't know- I have a very social I exchange with them, with not a lot of academic exchange.  So I would- outside of school.  
0:01:53.9 0:01:54.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:55.2 0:01:56.7 MALE:  But it has  a lot of nice people.
0:01:56.7 0:01:58.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Where were you before Stanford?
0:01:58.8 0:02:02.5 MALE:  I was at Georgia Tech.  I got my master's at Georgia Tech.  And then I came here.
0:02:01.9 0:02:04.9 FEMALE:  Wow.  Are- were- are you from Georgia? [laughter] 
0:02:04.0 0:02:05.6 MALE:  No.  I'm from India.
0:02:05.0 0:02:07.1 FEMALE:  What- what made you go to Georgia?
0:02:08.1 0:02:18.9 MALE:  What made me went to Georgia Tech?  They- they have a really interesting program call- uh, in design of technology and human computer interaction, which is- so I'm an engineering undergrad.
0:02:19.1 0:02:19.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:19.1 0:02:32.0 MALE:  And I wanted to focus on how the social aspects of technology rather than just the design.  So they have a good program in that.  And then, since I decided to come for a PhD, this program, the LSTD program here is pretty nice.  So that's [unintelligible].
0:02:31.5 0:02:34.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.  How did you like it in the south?
0:02:34.9 0:02:39.4 MALE:  It's nice.  I didn't like Atlanta that much, because the school is right in downtown, Georgia Tech.  
0:02:39.3 0:02:40.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
0:02:40.1 0:02:42.3 MALE:  But otherwise, I like Georgia.  I enjoyed it.
0:02:42.2 0:02:44.5 FEMALE:  Was that your first taste of the states?
0:02:44.3 0:02:45.0 MALE:  Kind of, yeah.
0:02:45.3 0:02:47.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Wow, that's- that's really interesting.
0:02:47.1 0:02:47.5 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:47.7 0:02:51.6 FEMALE:  So though- you- you must have done a lot of research to find the program that you liked.
0:02:50.5 0:02:52.8 MALE:  Not- yeah, like kind of yeah, I did.  
0:02:53.2 0:02:53.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:52.6 0:02:57.1 MALE:  But yeah.  And Georgia Tech is a different school, it's an engineering school.  So no- 
0:02:57.6 0:02:58.6 FEMALE:  I didn't know that.
0:02:57.6 0:02:59.8 MALE:  -very little sociology, no psychol- 
0:03:00.4 0:03:01.0 FEMALE:  Oh.
0:03:00.0 0:03:02.7 MALE:  -little psych, no soc, no anthro.
0:03:02.9 0:03:05.7 FEMALE:  Well I mean, the tech part of Georgia Tech kind of-
0:03:03.8 0:03:06.1 MALE:  Yeah.  That is really good.  It's really good.  
0:03:06.2 0:03:06.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:05.9 0:03:08.0 MALE:  So what- what bachelor's program are you in?
0:03:08.5 0:03:10.2 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] the policy program.
0:03:08.8 0:03:13.0 MALE:  [unintelligible]?  So this- you're the new cohort, right?  This is the first year [unintelligible].
0:03:12.1 0:03:17.8 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's the first- first year and it's growing.  Next year it's going to be a lot bigger than it was this year.  
0:03:17.4 0:03:17.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:17.8 0:03:21.1 FEMALE:  There's only like fifteen of us I think.  Or now there's seventeen of us.  
0:03:20.9 0:03:21.6 MALE:  Okay.
0:03:21.6 0:03:28.5 FEMALE:  And so next year, I think they're aiming for like thirty-five, something like that.  I don't really know but- and so it'll double in size.
0:03:28.6 0:03:30.4 MALE:  So how do you like your experience here?
0:03:30.8 0:03:32.2 FEMALE:  I really like it a lot. 
0:03:31.8 0:03:32.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:32.1 0:03:34.9 FEMALE:  I mean, I've been at Stanford for the past five years.
0:03:34.5 0:03:37.0 MALE:  Oh you did your undergrad here?  Okay.  Uh-huh.
0:03:35.1 0:03:45.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, I got my undergrad here.  Um, I enjoyed that.  But I think like your undergraduate experience is pretty much just you like not really knowing at all what you want to do.  
0:03:44.6 0:03:45.7 MALE:  [laughter] 
0:03:45.3 0:03:53.3 FEMALE:  But as a graduate student you have more of an idea of what you want to do and what you want [unintelligible] study.  So it's been a lot more enjoyable.  
0:03:52.9 0:03:54.5 MALE:  What department were you in, undergrad?
0:03:54.8 0:03:57.9 FEMALE:  History and political science.  Yeah.
0:03:55.9 0:03:59.2 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah, it's-
0:03:58.6 0:03:59.4 [horn]
0:04:00.6 0:04:04.2 FEMALE:  Wow.  Perfect timing.  [laughter]
0:04:03.5 0:04:04.6 MALE:  Yeah.  That was fast.  
0:04:05.3 0:04:06.6 FEMALE:  It was nice meeting you. 
0:04:05.1 0:04:06.9 MALE:  I think I did too.  Nice meeting you, female124.
0:04:06.5 0:04:07.8 FEMALE 2:  [unintelligible].
0:04:10.6 0:04:12.2 MALE:  I'm doing fine.  I need food. [laughter]
