0:15 0:15 MALE:  Nice to meet you as well.  

0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  Not many people get it right.  

0:17 0:17 MALE:  Huh?  

0:18 0:19 FEMALE:  Not many people get it right.  

0:18 0:19 MALE:  female235 it's, that's --  

0:21 0:25 FEMALE:  female235, female235, many things that I've never heard of before.  

0:24 0:25 MALE:  People say female235?  Wow.  

0:26 0:28 FEMALE:  You never know.  You never know, so --  

0:28 0:29 MALE:  I'm from Canada so maybe the French influence.  

0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  The French thing perhaps.  

0:30 0:32 MALE:  female235, don't pronounce the T, I don't know.  

0:33 0:39 FEMALE:  Absolutely, I know, actually I don't know French and I've been to the airport in France, [unintelligible] that's about it.  

0:39 0:41 MALE:  I spent one day in Paris and that was plenty for me.  

0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?  

0:42 0:44 MALE:  Montreal though, fantastic city.  

0:45 0:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, I [unintelligible] my high school actually [unintelligible], which is really random because I'm from San Francisco, but it seems like I had a lot of fun there.  

0:51 0:54 MALE:  Oh yeah Montreal, yeah Montreal is a great town.  A friend of mine is doing his PhD there.  

0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Oh really?  

0:55 0:56 MALE:  He absolutely loves it.  

0:58 1:03 FEMALE:  No I wish I would have gone there, I want to just go on the East Coast and you know like, I hear a lot of kids that go to school in the Northeast they take road trips into Canada.  

1:03 1:03 MALE:  Yeah.  

1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  I never did that and I really regret that.  

1:05 1:06 MALE:  Where did you go in the Northeast?  

1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  I went to Wellesley.  

1:06 1:07 MALE:  To where?  

1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Wellesley.  

1:08 1:08 MALE:  Wellesley okay.  

1:09 1:12 FEMALE:  And so Montreal I never went to, maybe one day.  

1:12 1:16 MALE:  It's too bad, I always thought people liked this drinking age of 18, so they [unintelligible] a drinking vacation.  

1:16 1:24 FEMALE:  I know, I know.  I don't know.  But now that we're of age half the fun is gone.  No, no [unintelligible] fun.  

1:24 1:36 MALE:  That really confused me coming here because I went from Canada where it's 18 as well and so I came down here when I was 22 and it's -- the bars are all -- where are the young people? I was 22 thinking where are the young people.  

1:36 1:45 FEMALE:  Really [unintelligible] [laughter].  It always felt kind of nice, because I hear like -- oh, but good when you came when you were 22 not 18 because that would have been a terrible shock.  

1:44 1:48 MALE:  Yeah I came down to visit my brother was doing school at Hastings for a semester.  

1:49 1:49 FEMALE:  Okay.  

1:48 1:54 MALE:  And so I went to visit him and when I was 20 or 19 and that was just -- I can't drink what the hell.  

1:56 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, I know why do you seem like the under age drinking culture here, like is it weird to you?  

2:00 2:08 MALE:  I guess kind of because the underage drinking culture, and I was in high school when I was like 16 and in high school passing around a bottle, something like that.  

2:09 2:12 FEMALE:  Yeah it still is here too, but it continues into college because like --  

2:11 2:15 MALE:  Yeah that, that surprises me, I'm just -- not being able to drink on campus.  

2:17 2:18 FEMALE:  Oh right.  

2:17 2:19 MALE:  Where I went to undergrad had pretty bars owned by students and you know bars, but you know.  

2:20 2:21 FEMALE:  That's awesome.  

2:20 2:22 MALE:  Top secret, 1,000 people.  

2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

2:23 2:28 MALE:  And they were cheap and good and here it's just -- yeah it's kind of surprising.  

2:29 2:43 FEMALE:  It's hard to find.  I know actually Wellesley was a dry town and the only place you could find like alcohol was Arts campus and even then it was just like beer and wine, like nothing hard and so lots of like room parties, like things like that, it was no fun, no fun at all.  

2:41 3:02 MALE:  Yeah, I remember traveling through Texas one time, going to [unintelligible] we drove through Lubbock [phonetic] dry town and what everyone does is there's a drive-thru liqueur store right across the county line and so how is a drive-thru liqueur store going to help things?  Yeah and then other parts it's like a drive-thru margarita stands.  They give you a margarita with a straw and they keep the sealed container because they have the little --  

3:03 3:05 FEMALE:  It's like paper on the straw or something?  

3:03 3:05 MALE:  Little paper on the straw.  

3:05 3:09 FEMALE:  [laughter] very fine line there.  

3:09 3:11 MALE:  Yeah it's -- I don't get it.  

3:12 3:20 FEMALE:  Yeah we couldn't buy alcohol on Sundays, it was like, all sort of weird thing.  I mean I come back here, you know, back home and like you can but it at drug stores, any time of day, like --  

3:19 3:23 MALE:  The thing I like the Costco hard liquor.  I lived in Texas for a few months and --  

3:24 3:24 FEMALE:  [laughter] oh yeah.  

3:23 3:26 MALE:  And Costco was beer only.   Costco hard liquor is great.  

3:26 3:32 FEMALE:   Really?  Oh, yeah we have a couple Costco hard liquor containers in our residence.  

3:32 3:34 MALE:  Yeah you get a giant bottle of something and it lasts forever.   

3:36 3:38 FEMALE:  Exactly.  Anyway, enough about alcohol.  

3:38 3:38 MALE:  Yeah.  

3:39 3:44 FEMALE:  [laughter] so what department are you in?  

3:43 3:44 MALE:  I'm in geophysics.  

3:46 3:48 FEMALE:  Oh so you -- I met somebody else in geophysics.  

3:48 3:52 MALE:  nameX, he's in my research  group class [unintelligible].  

3:53 3:56 FEMALE:  Arisonal [phonetic] is in my program, half the girls here I know.  

3:56 3:56 MALE:  School of Ed?  

3:57 4:05 FEMALE:  That's right, that's right.  So and I was telling nameX that he was the first person I think I met from geophysics like -- and he was like oh you'll meet another person, that's you.  

4:04 4:05 MALE:  That would be me.  

4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  I'm sure you'll meet more ed people.  

4:07 4:09 MALE:  Yeah I think I've met a couple now.  

4:10 4:12 FEMALE:  And [unintelligible] there's more.   Fun stuff.  

4:13 4:22 MALE:  This is kind of interesting, it's nice that things are kind of even here.  I don't know if your experience also on campus, I don't think it's fun for ed.  I don't know like the Rains [phonetic] parties and those things?  

4:23 4:25 FEMALE:  I live in Rains, yeah the Rains parties.  

4:25 4:25 MALE:  Yeah I'm in Rains.  

4:27 4:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

4:27 4:28 MALE:  female235 it was very nice to meet you.
