0:01 0:01 MALE:  Hey, female135.  
0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hey. 
0:02 0:03 MALE: I'm [unintelligible].  
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:04 0:05 MALE:  Nice to meet you too. How are you?  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  Good, how are you doing?  
0:06 0:12 MALE:  Good, good, good, very good.  [unintelligible] Yeah, so I can write everything down.  
0:12 0:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, what field are you in?  
0:15 0:22 MALE:  I'm in the [unintelligible] business school, second-year MBA, finishing up.  Looking forward to going to the real world.  How about you?  
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  I'm a doctoral student in education.  
0:25 0:25 MALE:  [unintelligible].  
0:25 0:25 FEMALE:  First year.  
0:27 0:28 MALE:  That's awesome.  
0:27 0:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, I will never go to the real world.  So...
0:34 0:39 MALE:  You like kind of being isolated, you know, from the real world working with really exciting kids.
0:39 0:50 FEMALE:  I don't know.  What I was doing before I was doing lobbying was like apologies, and that was really too much of the real world.  You know what I mean.  Like it's really cutthroat in [unintelligible].  
0:51 0:52 MALE:  Were you in Washington?  
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  I was in Wisconsin.  
0:53 0:54 MALE:  Oh, okay.  In Madison?  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:55 0:55 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:55 1:02 FEMALE:  I did the state legislature.  Yeah, so it's nice to be kind of away from all of the politics.  
1:02 1:07 MALE:  Yeah, it is.  It's kind of fun to be the gospel again.  
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
1:09 1:22 MALE:  That's how I feel.  I worked for about three years before I came to grad school to GSB.  And the one thing I really like about this place is you have the time to do your own things.  
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:23 1:34 MALE:  I don't know.  I mean maybe the PhD in education is--I mean the PhDs are generally more intense.  So, I don't know how much free time you can find.  But what kind of things do you like to do in the free time if you have any at all? 
1:33 1:39 FEMALE:  I like to like walk the dish, and I live in Mountain View.  There are some wonderful walks in Mountain View. 
1:40 1:41 MALE:  Cool.  Cool. 
1:41 1:46 FEMALE:  So, I like to do that and like go to like Half Moon Bay or like--I like to, you know, take little day trips.  
1:48 1:50 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, oh, that's great.  I like that stuff too.  
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, what about you?  
1:51 2:00 MALE:  I like to [unintelligible].  I like going around like--just doing it like--I love the dish like most every place.  
2:00 2:03 FEMALE:  It's so like--it's so pretty and like just right there.  
2:05 2:05 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:04 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's great.  
2:07 2:21 MALE:  Yeah, and so it's like a really beautiful vista.  Also, I like going to the beaches, going to [unintelligible], going to San Francisco, Farthing, all that kind of stuff.  
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  You stay active it sounds like.  
2:24 2:30 MALE: Yeah, yeah, it's a great place.   I went to Madison Lake last year.  
2:29 2:29 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  
2:31 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, spent some time in my two really good friends back from high school playing Madison out.  
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  Cool.  
2:38 2:40 MALE:  So, like we really enjoyed the [unintelligible].  
2:39 2:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:42 2:42 MALE:  It got cold though.  
2:43 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a good town.  
2:46 2:51 MALE:  Yeah.  Do you live anywhere close to like the capital building?  
2:50 2:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, I live like two blocks from the capital.  I lived right downtown.  
2:55 2:56 MALE:  It's good size.  
2:56 3:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, I kind of miss that because where I live, like I walked to work.  I could walk to bars.  Like everything was within walking.  
3:05 3:05 MALE:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Right.  
3:05 3:09 FEMALE:  If I never had to drive [unintelligible], and now I have to drive everywhere.  
3:11 3:12 MALE:  Yeah, in California.  
3:11 3:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:13 3:13 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:12 3:15 FEMALE:  So, that's kind of sad.  I miss being kind of in a downtown.  
3:17 3:34 MALE:  One of my friends--actually, the--I mean I'm originally from Yugoslavia, but I was living with an American family in Ohio and so my two close brothers were in Wisconsin.  My older folks [unintelligible] is a microbrewer at one of those pubs.  That they call the capital.  I forgot the name.  
3:34 3:35 FEMALE:  Oh, like the Great Dane Dinner.  
3:36 3:37 MALE:  The Great Dane, exactly.  
3:36 3:37 FEMALE:  Oh, my god, that's so exciting.  
3:38 3:38 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:39 3:41 FEMALE:  That's so funny.  I haven't thought about the Great Dane in years.  
3:42 3:47 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  Just look for nameX.  You guessed the premiere.  
3:46 3:51 FEMALE:  I will remember that.  That makes me kind of homesick for Madison now.  
3:52 3:58 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, it's a great place. I was just there during the daytime.  So, but it was so laid back.  
3:57 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, it is.  It's like a slower pace.  
4:02 4:02 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  You know, [unintelligible].  
4:03 4:03 MALE:  Yeah.  
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, here it's like [laughter]  
4:05 4:08 MALE:  Yeah, it's very fast.  Yes.  Good to meet you, female135.
