00:59 01:01 MALE: Oh, no, no.  I just started first year grad school here.  
01:01 01:03 FEMALE: Oh, so you worked at the MIT as what?  
01:04 01:05 MALE: Uh, you know Lincoln Laboratory?  
01:05 01:06 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  
01:07 01:08 MALE: So I worked there.  
01:07 01:08 FEMALE: How do you like it?  
01:09 01:14 MALE: It's good.  Um, it's, uh, lots of secret, secret stuff and, you know, it's all government.  
01:13 01:15 FEMALE: What do you mean secret, secret stuff?  
01:15 01:22 MALE: It's, like, all government, like government, you know, sponsored programs so we work on a lot of secret, secret programs.  And so--
01:21 01:23 FEMALE: Oh, secret, secret--do you have to say secret twice every time?  
01:24 01:35 MALE: Yeah, we say that because, you know, we need to [unintelligible] clearance and everything that gets through the door and all that stuff.  So that was fun.  Um, but I think, like, you know, I feel like I should go and get a master's before, you know, I settle down.  
01:36 01:37 FEMALE: Okay.  So...
01:37 01:41 MALE: Well, what about you?  You're in the education department, right?  [unintelligible], 'cause that's your professor?     
01:41 01:53 FEMALE: No, no.  So I'm in--I did chemical engineering at MIT but I--I'm doing a very interdisciplinary program here.  Um, so I'm studying social entrepreneurship actually.  
01:54 01:55 MALE: Social entrepreneurship?  
01:54 01:57 FEMALE: Yeah.  Related to water projects in developing countries.  
01:58 01:59 MALE: Nice.  
01:58 02:11 FEMALE: So I look for technologies or social innovations, like what happened in Latin American countries, for example, to promote economic development and also, you know, bring water for people.  
02:12 02:18 MALE: Okay.  I was just, uh, at the BASES meeting yesterday.  They were talking about the Social E-Challenge.  
02:16 02:22 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's--I'm an officer there.  We have a last round today.  That's why I'm dressed, like, funny.  [laughter]
02:24 02:26 MALE: [laughter] [unintelligible]
02:25 02:38 FEMALE: I have to bring something out of--professional today so I painted my nails like crazy because I hate dressing like this so I had to be, like, I'm not so professional, you know.  So I, I did that.  
02:40 02:43 MALE: Oh, so I'm probably going to join BASES next year, so.  
02:41 02:44 FEMALE: You are?  Are you interested in Social E or are you interested in [unintelligible]?  
02:45 02:47 MALE: I really like Interact.  Or something like that.  
02:46 02:46 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
02:48 02:56 MALE: But, um, I was thinking about Social E but decided between Social E, interact or, um, marketing, so I'm not sure.    
02:54 02:55 FEMALE: Okay.  Oh, that's great.  
02:57 03:03 MALE: I'm in the ASES [phonetic] right now, which is Asia-Pacific Student Entrepreneurship Society.  It's like the Asia Pacific [unintelligible].    
03:01 03:04 FEMALE: I hear that also.  Oh, okay.  So what do you guys do?  
03:06 03:09 MALE: Probably very similar things to BASES except more geared toward Asia stuff.  
03:08 03:09 FEMALE: But you have competition?  
03:12 03:25 MALE: We don't have competitions.  We have a--our big thing is we have a conference and we have, like, 50 delegates from overseas that come over.  We just had this conference last month.  And so the delegates come over and we interact with them, they stay over at our house and then...  
03:23 03:26 FEMALE: All right, what--are you Chinese, Korean or Japanese?  
03:28 03:28 MALE: I'm Chinese.  
03:26 03:27 FEMALE: Okay.  
03:29 03:29 MALE: What about you?  
03:27 03:34 FEMALE: I'm Korean that's why I was asking you because there is a lot of that kind of stuff going with the Korean community, I think, that they have conferences.  
03:37 03:37 MALE: Okay.  
03:36 03:44 FEMALE: And everyone's, like--oh, that's great.  So I'll be seeing you a lot because I'll be in socially challenged next year for sure.  
03:44 03:47 MALE: Socially challenged, okay.  Yeah.
03:45 03:47 FEMALE: That was a lame joke yesterday.  
03:50 03:50 MALE: You were there?  
03:49 03:51 FEMALE: Yeah.  I was in the back.  
03:53 04:00 MALE: Okay.  I don't remember.  But anyway, that's cool.  That's good.  So, um, so you come straight from Korea or-- 
03:59 04:02 FEMALE: No, I lived in Argentina all my life so I'm Argentinean.  
04:04 04:05 MALE: Oh, Argentina.  
04:03 04:04 FEMALE: That's why my accent is Spanish.  
04:06 04:09 MALE: Yeah.  I thought you were Japanese or something when I first--
04:07 04:10 FEMALE: Nobody thinks I'm Korean for some reason.  I don't know why.  
04:12 04:15 MALE: You look Korean but your accent sounds like it's still Japanese or something.  
04:13 04:14 FEMALE: Oh, [unintelligible].  
04:16 04:16 MALE: But anyway.  
04:15 04:16 FEMALE: I'll see you around.
04:18 04:19 MALE: Okay.
