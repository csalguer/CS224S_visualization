0:21 0:27 FEMALE:  Let's see, I like to bum around and [laughter] eat lots of food and have dinner parties at my place.  And...
0:27 0:28 MALE:  Well, that's cool.
0:28 0:32 FEMALE:  [laughter] I like to cook, but I'm not very good, so.  And...
0:32 0:34 MALE:  It's the desire that will make you good.
0:34 0:38 FEMALE:  I just learned how to make a really good white sauce for pasta too, so [laughter].
0:38 0:39 MALE:  Very nice.
0:39 0:45 FEMALE:  It's all like heavy whipping cream and like butter and cheese, so it's everything that's bad for you [laughter].
0:45 0:49 MALE:  Cool, so if my four minutes goes well is there any way that I can sample that um...
0:50 0:55 FEMALE:  Absolutely [laughter] I just learned how to make it like [laughter].  So of course I'm going to make it for like, as many people as possible [laughter].
0:56 1:08 MALE:  Excellent, yeah I took a cooking class um, at the I center here and um, I took it last quarter I guess, or two quarters ago. And it was very cool, but um, yeah, I haven't had a chance to make recipes for people, that's...
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  Have you made them for yourself?
1:11 1:17 MALE:  Um, I don't like taking the time to cook for myself, to do, like to do any really nice.
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:18 1:20 MALE:  I'll go, like, okay, I've done some of them actually.
1:20 1:21 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
1:21 1:26 MALE:  But, um, I actually should have a dinner party.  It's something that I tell myself to do, but I normally do about once a year, only.
1:26 1:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, I know, that's like how often I do it too.  I'm, I live in a house too, so I feel like you know, I have all the cookware and like all the resources to put together a nice dinner party.  But [laughter] I just don't do it.
1:39 1:39 MALE:  Yeah.
1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  So, yeah.
1:41 1:42 MALE:  Are you almost out of school?
1:42 1:45 FEMALE:  I am, I graduate in two weeks, and so, I'm very happy.
1:44 1:46 MALE:  Excellent, what are you going to do then?
1:46 1:48 FEMALE:  I'm going to be an attorney [laughter].
1:48 1:48 MALE:  Locally?
1:48 1:49 FEMALE:  No, in New York.
1:50 1:51 MALE:  New York?
1:51 1:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm moving to Manhattan.  I'm really excited about that.
1:53 1:58 MALE:  What are you doing here?  You don't need to meet local people anymore.  You need to meet people who are from New York or...
1:56 2:04 FEMALE:  I know, I know, I thought about that, I was kind of like, yeah, I probably shouldn't have come to this [laughter].
2:02 2:06 MALE:  I'm sorry I don't mean to be like, I don't mean to be rude, but [laughter].
2:06 2:14 FEMALE:  No, no, I mean, it's true, I mean what are the chances of meeting someone who is also miraculously moving to New York in [laughter] September, but...
2:14 2:22 MALE:  Oh you're, you 're not going until September.  Well then you could at least like, you know,  meet people who you would want to kind of like hang out or, what not, you know.
2:21 2:26 FEMALE:  [laughter] yeah, yeah, no [unintelligible] [laughter].
2:24 2:33 MALE:  [unintelligible].  That's the only reason, I mean, yeah, I shouldn't say that.  I know, I just kind of thought that it would be a good idea to come here, you know what I mean?
2:34 2:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, have you done speed dating before?
2:36 2:37 MALE:  I haven't, no.
2:37 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, me neither [laughter].  I got here and they thought I was a guy.  They're like, oh, we couldn't tell from your name.  I was like, did you read like the survey that I filled out [laughter].
2:46 2:47 MALE:  I guess not.
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, oh, well, that's alright.
2:49 2:55 MALE:  Well, I want you to know that I'm going to give you a very high score for intelligent because I think it's the only respectable thing to do for people.
2:55 2:56 FEMALE:  Oh, thanks.
2:56 2:57 MALE:  Because I'm sure that we're all very intelligent.
2:58 3:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean some of these things are weird.  Because like how do you tell if someone's ambitious, like, it's like, um...
3:04 3:12 MALE:  And do you care?  Well I mean maybe some, maybe you do, I mean maybe I would care if you were really not ambitious.  But it's not my, [unintelligible].
3:12 3:13 FEMALE:  Totally not.
3:14 3:17 MALE:  Anyway, um, we shouldn't talk about this, um.  What else do you like to do?
3:18 3:26 FEMALE:  Um, I guess just like read and hang out and [laughter].  I like, I guess a lot of the things that a lot of people like to do [laughter].
