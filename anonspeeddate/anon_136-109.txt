0:13 0:14 MALE:  Nice meeting you, female136.  
0:15 0:17 FEMALE:  What are you, uh, what are you studying here?  
0:17 0:21 MALE:  Studying electrical engineering, second year, MS.  How about you?  
0:24 0:31 FEMALE:  This was my first year in law school, or law school.  And are you--from California?  Are you from--
0:30 0:36 MALE:  [interposing]  No, actually I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia, and then I came to U.S. for college.  
0:38 0:43 FEMALE:  Okay, it's like if you life the country and it's pliable where in the U.S. did you go to school at? 
0:43 0:44 MALE:  I went to Perdue University in Indiana.  
0:46 0:48 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  Did you do engineering there?
0:47 0:59 MALE:  Actually I did mathematics for undergrads and computer science. But I started to do [unintelligible] but not five cents worth.  How about you?  What is your major in undergrad?  
1:01 1:09 FEMALE:  What is my major?  You're going to laugh.  Um, Um, I majored in French and architectural history.  
1:09 1:11 MALE:  French and architectural history?  
1:12 1:12 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
1:12 1:18  MALE:  So, do you study architecture as architecture or more work the history behind the architecture.  
1:19 1:24 FEMALE:  More of the history.  I mean I did--I did send architecture.  
1:23 1:27 MALE:  That sounds like it is one of the most exotic majors I have ever heard.  
1:29 1:36 FEMALE:  I mean I started out thinking that I was going to be an architect.  
1:35 1:35 MALE:  Oh, I see.   
1:37 1:51 FEMALE:  That I was really interested in so it would be hard and the history.  And I really loved it.  For a long time I thought I would go into like city planning.  
1:53 1:55 MALE:  Oh, I see, like urban planning. I see.  
1:55 2:02 FEMALE:  But then I worked for a few years after college and decided that I wanted to go to law school.  
2:01 2:03 MALE:  Oh, I see so what did you do before law school?  
2:06 2:18 FEMALE:  Nothing related to my major.  I worked--whatever [unintelligible] actually.  I worked for a public affairs firm in DC that did a lot of governmental purchasing work.  
2:18 2:19 MALE:  What's the name of the firm? 
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  The firm?  
2:21 2:21 MALE:  Yeah, the firm.  
2:23 2:25 FEMALE:  It's called [unintelligible].  
2:24 2:30 MALE:  Oh, it's a private firm that deals with the government.  Oh, I see, okay.  I thought it's a government [unintelligible].  
2:29 2:35 FEMALE:  No, but I want to work for the government.  
2:34 2:35 MALE:  Oh, really?  
2:36 2:36 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:36 2:40 MALE:  Why would you want to work for the government, yeah.  
2:41 3:09 FEMALE:  Because I'm really interested in international law, and I think like working for the State Department, for example, would be--I mean they have--it's some of the most interesting international law firms around.  I mean pretty much everything I could do for a firm would be transactions between large companies, one in the U.S. and one in another country.  And that's--to me that's not international law.  That's a transaction between international entities.  
3:09 3:09 MALE:  I see.  
3:10 3:14 FEMALE:  But the State Department does more international law. Like U.N. law.  
3:15 3:21 MALE:  So, what makes you decide to go to law school instead of MBA or are you just into law?  
3:25 3:38 FEMALE:  I actually  thought about goals, and I decided I'm going to because I thought it was more--I wanted more of an [unintelligible] experience.  And I'm not saying that an MBA isn't, but it was more to me, uhm--
3:38 3:41 MALE:  Commercial, like there is this [unintelligible] and finance.  
3:43 3:51 FEMALE: Yeah, that is what I was going to do.  How about you?  I mean how did you know that electrical engineering was what you wanted to do?  
3:50 4:05 MALE:  I think it's just some kind of--actually I don't really know.  I just liked science when I was a kid.  So, that's why everything [unintelligible].  It was a nice talking to you, female136.  
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Nice talking to you, male109.
