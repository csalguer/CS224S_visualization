FILE NAME: Male Speaker 111 -- Female Speaker 130


0:01 0:01 MALE:  Hi.  
0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hi.  
0:07 0:14 MALE:  male111, not male111 all right?  Only my mother calls me male111.  You're Christine?  
0:14 0:14 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:15 0:16 MALE:  How's it going so far?  
0:16 0:18 FEMALE:  Oh, I am tired.  [laughter]  
0:18 0:19 MALE:  I know.  It's like we're almost near the end.  
0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  Really, really tired.  
0:20 0:25 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, it's been a long week.  For all Stanford grad students it's been a pretty long week.  
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  So, what are you doing?  
0:27 0:30 MALE:  I'm in the political science program getting a PhD.
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  Ah, [unintelligible].  
0:31 0:31 MALE:  Oh, wow.  
0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  What are you doing?  
0:33 0:39 MALE:  I'm only studying comparative politics comparing U.S. and European like history.  
0:40 0:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, I like that.  
0:41 0:43 MALE:  Oh, I like it too thankfully.  
0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  I am from Romania.  
0:43 0:45 MALE:  Oh, okay, I wish I knew more about it.  
0:45 0:47 FEMALE:  So, do you--no, you don't compare anything with Eastern Europe?  
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Mainly it's Germany and the U.S. 
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  Germany?  
0:51 1:06 MALE:  But hopeful--the hopeful sort of [unintelligible] travel to is Western and Eastern Europe as well. And so like, uh, I mean eventually I'd like to spend a little bit of, put a little bit of peer work in in Hungary, maybe Romania and sort of--like I haven't picked those countries yet.  
1:07 1:10 FEMALE: Why do you want to go to Eastern Europe?  
1:11 1:26 MALE:  Well, I'm interested in kind of the role of business lobbyists in developed democracies, but theoretically if I'm missing the history of these countries, there should be something contemporary in Eastern and Central Europea that would matter as well.  I've been meaning to take those on [unintelligible] economy and that kind of thing.  
1:25 1:26 FEMALE: And what did you find out?  
1:27 1:29 MALE:  It's a picture [unintelligible].  
1:30 1:31 FEMALE:  I don't know how it is.  
1:31 2:00 MALE:  Well, the main thing is what we think of like as business lobbies like in the U.S. and Germany are much more powerful in Central and Eastern European Countries in terms of setting policy and what not.  The U.S. for lobbies and Germany the lobbies are kind of all of these other countervailing forces like [unintelligible] labor and what not.  Whereas in Eastern countries it's different.  That's all I know.  Basically, it's not the same tenth or so.  I mean they're revised.  
2:00 2:03 FEMALE:  Do you have to be [unintelligible]?  
2:04 2:05 MALE:  So, you were born in Romania?  
2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:06 2:08 MALE:  And then did you come to the U.S. for school?  
2:08 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:09 2:14 MALE:  Okay. How do you like the--[unintelligible] in philosophy?  Do you like it so far?  
2:14 2:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, I like it a lot.  I start liking [unintelligible].  
2:18 2:20 MALE:  Yeah, are you interested in analytic philosophy?  
2:21 2:24 FEMALE:  Yeah, and it's very much [unintelligible].  
2:24 2:27 MALE:  Oh wow, so I didn't know the two were also [unintelligible].  
2:27 2:29 FEMALE: And I wanted to [unintelligible] political philosopher.  
2:29 2:29 MALE:  Oh, really.  
2:30 2:33 FEMALE:  For instance, I'm interested in like [unintelligible] women's rights.  
2:34 2:37 MALE:  Oh, interesting.  
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Abortion and stuff.  
2:38 2:45 MALE: Right, so some very like contemporary issues.  Yeah.  Do you know of Jacques Cohen's [phonetic] work?  
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, a little.  
2:45 2:48 MALE:  He is MIT's political philosopher.  He is here for the year.  
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Oh, he is here?  
2:49 3:04 MALE:  Yeh, just for the year.  He's technically a political scientist, but he might--I mean I think he's visiting.  He might come here.  He might stay here at Stanford, which would be great because [unintelligible] political.  
3:04 3:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, I would like philosophers to do more like equality, to be more involved, you know, make changes in the way people live.  
3:12 3:12 MALE:  Right, right.  
3:14 3:22 FEMALE:  Not just to justify [unintelligible] and nobody cares.  Philosophy is all like--
3:22 3:38 MALE:  [interposing]  I know very little.  I read some ethics.  I've read some stuff--I really like Peter Unger's work, "[unintelligible] Ethics and Redistributed Justice."  I've only read like some [unintelligible].  
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Do you find them relevant?  
3:40 3:46 MALE:  I think [unintelligible] because I'm interested in welfare distribution and the role of like individuals.  You know--
3:46 3:53 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Because I find it so hard that I don't want to [unintelligible] to distribute [unintelligible].  
3:53 3:59 MALE:  Right, yeah.  Yeah, well that's the thing.  The thing about political science is we don't have to be normative.  We can just be empirical.  But--
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  Yeah, and [unintelligible].  
4:02 4:11 MALE:  You try to measure different countries and things that you care about, and you try to understand why some countries better provide than others.  That's the best that you can do I think, that one can do.  
4:11 4:14 FEMALE:  How do we finance culture?  Like art.  
4:16 4:16 MALE:  Finance?  
4:16 4:22 FEMALE: Like art, yeah, because it looks like in capitalism arts are going out the window.  
4:22 4:22 MALE:  Right, right.  
4:23 4:23 FEMALE:  I don't like that.  
4:27 4:27 MALE:  One argument is [crosstalk].
