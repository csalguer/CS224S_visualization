0:01 0:11 MALE: Too bad we can't meet yet, it would have been so great.  [laughter]  So I'm from Australia, and I have a sunburn because I went on a mountain.  male207.

0:05 0:07 FEMALE: female221.  Hi.  What do you do?

0:14 0:19 MALE: What do I do?  I play a lot of basketball.  I, um, I'm getting a PhD in electrical engineering.

0:13 0:14 FEMALE: What year are you? 

0:21 0:21 MALE: Third.

0:15 0:16 FEMALE: How do you like it so far?

0:24 0:27 MALE: I like it.  I had to switch advisers at the beginning of this year, which was kind of a little frustrating. 

0:21 0:21 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:30 0:35 MALE: But I mean, I like it here, so even if it's going to be an extra year, it's probably okay.  Probably - I think I can finish in three more. 

0:29 0:31 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.  What do you want to do after that?

0:39 0:41 MALE: Um, good thing I don't have to think about it yet, because I still have three left.

0:34 0:35 FEMALE: [laughter].

0:42 0:47 MALE: But um, I don't think I want to be a professor at first, I want to go into industry, I think, for a little while.

0:40 0:41 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

0:48 0:51 MALE: But other than that, I don't really know.  Change the world; how's that for an answer?

0:45 0:45 FEMALE: World peace.

0:52 0:55 MALE: I'm not sure I can achieve that through electrical engineering, but if I could, I would.

0:50 0:50 FEMALE: Right.

0:56 0:57 MALE: [laughter].  How about you?

0:51 0:53 FEMALE: I'm a first-year PhD in Russian literature.

1:00 1:00 MALE: Russian literature?

0:55 0:55 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:01 1:02 MALE: Wow.  I liked Brothers Karamazov.

0:57 0:58 FEMALE: That's a good book.

1:04 1:06 MALE: I didn't like The Death of Ivan Ilyich.

1:00 1:00 FEMALE: Why?

1:07 1:10 MALE: I don't know. I just didn't like it.  Just that.

1:05 1:06 FEMALE: Lots of Russian literature is very sad.

1:13 1:16 MALE: Yeah, Brothers Karamazov, I guess has some sad stuff, but like -

1:09 1:13 FEMALE: Yeah, kind of the anguished pathos kind of country.

1:20 1:22 MALE: What else about -- I think those are two big ones.  Is there anything else?  

1:17 1:18 FEMALE: There's lots, I mean -

1:23 1:25 MALE: What -- yeah, but like what are the big ones?

1:19 1:22 FEMALE: War and Peace, Anna Karenina, uh -

1:26 1:28 MALE: Oh, right.  Nope, haven't read any of those. 

1:22 1:22 FEMALE: - Crime and Punishment.  

1:29 1:31 MALE: Nope. Which of those three are the best?

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Crime and Punishment.  

1:32 1:32 MALE:  Okay.

1:28 1:32 FEMALE: A close second, Anna Karenina.  I haven't read War and Peace, so I don't know about that one.

1:37 1:41 MALE: Okay.  You haven't read one of them?  Doesn't it seem like - you're going to have to read it, soon, right?

1:35 1:35 FEMALE: I don't know.

1:42 1:47 MALE: What?  You can't be like a PhD in something, and not have read like one of the seminary works in it.

1:41 1:44 FEMALE: Yeah, I guess so.  But, you know, I'm not going to focus on Tolstoy.

1:50 1:50 MALE: Okay.

1:45 1:46 FEMALE: You know, he's not my guy, so...

1:52 1:53 MALE: Who is your guy?  

1:47 1:55 FEMALE: I don't know.  I like modern stuff.  I like post, um, well like Soviet Era and post-Soviet Era stuff.

2:00 2:03 MALE: Oh, okay.  Is there -- are there any famous people?

1:58 2:10 FEMALE: Um, well, like early 20th century is people like Pasternak, um, Bulgakov, uh, yeah, probably no one else you would have ever heard of.

2:16 2:16 MALE: Okay.

2:11 2:13 FEMALE: But if you ever get a chance to read "Master and Margarita" --

2:19 2:19 MALE: Okay.

2:14 2:18 FEMALE: - by Bulgakov, that's like the best 20th Century Russian book ever, yeah.

2:23 2:29 MALE: Cool.  I like to read.  Actually, I took a Victorian novels class in college [unintelligible].

2:23 2:23 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:30 2:44 MALE: But, I don't know, I mostly -- I don't know, I think of reading as like a pleasure thing, so I don't think I get -- I mean, I like to read like even some classics for pleasure, but I just never really -- I feel I don't get as much out of it necessarily as some people do.

2:38 2:38 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:45 2:48 MALE: I think I don't think that deeply about it, I like to just go with the flow.

2:42 2:48 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, if you're looking for like, uh, just kind of a happy escape, War and Peace is not going to do it for you.  [laughter].

2:53 2:54 MALE: Well, you know I mean I also like to be -

2:49 2:50 FEMALE: Challenged?

2:56 2:57 MALE: Yeah, stimulated.  

2:51 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:58 3:03 MALE: But I don't like, I don't know, I'm just not good at the whole, like, symbolism and all that, so, I don't know.

2:57 3:00 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where are you from originally?

3:07 3:08 MALE: I'm from Virginia, near D.C.

3:02 3:03 FEMALE: How do you like California?

3:10 3:10 MALE: Love it.

3:04 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah?

3:11 3:12 MALE: How about you, where are you from?

3:06 3:06 FEMALE: Uh, Oregon.

3:13 3:13 MALE: Okay.

3:07 3:12 FEMALE: Portland.  So, it's good.  I had an in-bred hatred of California for a long time.

3:18 3:20 MALE: Now you're getting over it, slowly but surely?

3:14 3:20 FEMALE: But I -- yeah, after I came back home from college and spent a few years there, it was California started to look very, very nice.

3:27 3:28 MALE: [laughter].  Where did you go to college?

3:22 3:22 FEMALE: Uh, Darmouth.

3:29 3:29 MALE: My Dad went to Dartmouth.

3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Oh, really?  What year?

3:32 3:35 MALE: Oh God, what year was he?  '72, '74.

3:29 3:30 FEMALE: Nice, yeah.

3:36 3:41 MALE: But yeah, he -- I actually looked at it, and - but couldn't really handle the whole...

3:35 3:37 FEMALE: Yeah.  It was beautiful.

3:43 3:44 MALE: So did you just graduate?

3:38 3:45 FEMALE: No, I graduated in '99, so I've been, um -- I worked in law firms and went to law school for a year and a half.

3:52 3:53 MALE: Okay.  Didn't like law school?

3:46 3:51 FEMALE: And then -- I liked law school, I just didn't think it was my thing to -- I don't like working in general, so...

3:56 3:59 MALE:  Okay.  Working is not the most fun thing.

3:53 3:56 FEMALE:  No, it's really not.  I really don't like it.  [laughter].

4:02 4:02 MALE:  Yeah.

3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  So I figured... [laughter].

4:04 4:06 MALE:  So you know, what you need to do is marry rich.

3:59 4:06 FEMALE:  Yes, I've actually like realized that that's, you know... so if I'm not going to make shit as a professor or as anything else, then...

4:12 4:16 MALE:  No.  Speed-dating at a university might not be the best place to marry rich, but you know -

4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  [laughter].

4:16 4:17 MALE:  - chances are -- you've got to get -

4:10 4:13 FEMALE:  I should just start asking, "What's your income potential?"  Eh!

4:20 4:21 MALE:  Well, it was good to meet you.

4:14 4:14 FEMALE: [laughter].  You, too.

@4:14 4:17 MALE:  [unintelligible] over your shoulder, please.
