0:07 0:10 FEMALE: I'm female327.  That's right.   How's it going, male311?
0:10 0:13 MALE:  You see, I appreciate a good name.  I have a boring name, so.
0:14 0:15 FEMALE: That's not boring to you at all.
0:15 0:21 MALE: Oh come on.  See you wouldn't know, 'cause how many Shubas have you ever met, besides yourself?
0:21 0:26 FEMALE: Um, I'm sure there's very many others in women who are named female327 too [laughter].
0:27 0:29 MALE: You haven't met [unintelligible], right?  Yeah.  male311's, they're a dime a dozen.
0:29 0:29 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:30 0:34 MALE: I'm very common.  Yeah.  So I have to make out, you know, with like-
0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  That's all right.  That's all right.
0:37 0:38 MALE: So what are you studying?
0:39 0:43 FEMALE: I study early childhood development and psychology here in the school of education.
0:44 0:47 MALE: So you can sort of--you know, you need someone----this is like old hat for you, like--
0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Well [laughter]--
0:49 0:52 MALE: Yeah, his facial tick indicates that, you know, his mother----
0:52 0:56 FEMALE: I'm sure, everyone used to think this when I'd say something about psychology. 
0:57 0:57 MALE: Really?
0:57 1:00 FEMALE: I think I cut it down to early childhood development.
1:00 1:00 MALE: Okay.
1:01 1:02 FEMALE: And they're like, okay, so you won't be judging me then.
1:03 1:07 MALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah [laughter].  It's like I want to see your early inner child.
1:07 1:07 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].
1:10 1:10 MALE: If you're having problems there. 
1:12 1:13 FEMALE: So how about you?  What do you study here?
1:14 1:17 MALE: Um, I'm in the electrical engineering program.  I did an MBA, but----
1:19 1:19 FEMALE: [unintelligible].
1:19 1:22 MALE: ----[unintelligible] yeah, and then finished that and went to electrical engineering.
1:22 1:24 FEMALE: Can't get enough of graduate school, can you?
1:24 1:26 MALE: Well no, I work part time, too.  So--
1:26 1:26 FEMALE: I see.
1:27 1:30 MALE: So 'cause there's only so much, like you said---- 
1:30 1:31 FEMALE: Yeah, sure.
1:31 1:33 MALE: ----school you can take before you go insane, and go postal on everyone, right?
1:33 1:34 FEMALE: Exactly.  Yeah.
1:35 1:37 MALE: So which I'm sure happens.  You probably would see the signs of that early on.
1:37 1:41 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].  Maybe I experienced that myself [laughter].
1:41 1:52 MALE: That facial tick indicates he has about two minutes to go. [laughter]  So yeah.  No, I--on the flip side, there's a philosophy that people should always learning somethi
1:53 1:55 FEMALE: I agree with you.  Yeah.
1:55 2:00 MALE: I mean, you know, how many times do you hear people say, you know what?  I'm out of school.  I don't have to learn to take a test ever again?
2:00 2:00 FEMALE: I know.
2:01 2:02 MALE: Forget it.  They're wrong.
2:02 2:02 FEMALE: That's true.
2:03 2:04 MALE: It happens all the time.  So.
2:04 2:06 FEMALE: I know.  Life is the [unintelligible].  So.
2:06 2:08 MALE: So is this a master's program or a PhD program?
2:09 2:10 FEMALE: I'm in the PhD program here, so.
2:12 2:14 MALE: Okay.  So how did you get into early childhood development?
2:14 2:24  FEMALE: Um, what was an interesting story, actually.  I studied social psychology as an undergraduate.  Um, but it was social psychology in a design based discipline.
2:24 2:25 MALE: Okay.
2:25 2:29 FEMALE: So basically, I studied how the built in environment influences human behavior.
2:29 2:31 MALE: How the environment includes--okay.
2:32 2:35 FEMALE: How the built environment influences human behavior.
2:33 2:34 MALE: Oh built?  Okay.
2:35 2:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:35 2:35 MALE: Okay wow.
2:37 2:40 FEMALE: Um, and so it was kind of like architecture, interior design, that kind of stuff.
2:40 2:42 MALE: Oh really?  That picture's pretty fascinating.
2:42 2:43 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:43 2:45 MALE: Because you know, like take this for instance, right?
2:45 2:45 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:46 2:49 MALE: You know, it's actually probably a good place to have this kind of thing, because it's sort of open. 
2:49 2:49 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
2:50 2:50 MALE: You know----
2:51 2:51 FEMALE: That's true. That's true.
2:52 2:53 MALE: It's sort of interesting.
2:53 2:57 FEMALE: So I did some work on preschool classrooms, in designing preschool classrooms.
2:57 2:57 MALE: Oh that's neat.
2:57 3:01 FEMALE: [unintelligible] kind of got interested in early childhood back then.
3:01 3:02 MALE: Wow.
3:02 3:04 FEMALE: Did some policy work in D.C. for about a year.
3:05 3:05 MALE: Oh cool.
3:05 3:19 FEMALE: ----around early childhood education, and just wanted to go to grad school.  So I did some grad school up in Boston, did some more graduate school in New York.  And then, I'm in the final graduate school phase here, I hope [laughter].  So--
3:19 3:20 MALE: Wow.  Oh so you're almost done with your degree?
3:20 3:23 FEMALE: Um, I'm just working on my dissertation right now, you know.
3:23 3:23 MALE: Okay.
3:23 3:24 FEMALE: Um, we're--
3:25 3:26 MALE: So that's like lots of self discipline.
3:26 3:27 FEMALE: Yeah.  And I don't have a lot of that--
3:28 3:28 MALE: No.
3:28 3:30 FEMALE: ----unfortunately, you know.
3:30 3:31 MALE: You're like, I [unintelligible] maybe today.
3:32 3:34 FEMALE: Yeah.  I know [laughter].
3:35 3:38 MALE: 'Cause movies, you know, people get influenced by movies as kids. 
3:38 3:47 FEMALE: True, true.  So yeah.  But I think, you know, I'm getting there.  I'm getting closer.  But I don't know that I'm in like a huge rush to finish, you know.
3:47 3:50 MALE: Yeah.  Well I think that it's important to take your--
3:50 3:50 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:50 3:50 MALE: ----time.
3:50 3:51 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:51 3:55 MALE: Because you know, if I assume that, you know, the research you'll be measured on wherever you go.  
3:55 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:55 3:59 MALE: [unintelligible] doing research or are you going to be doing teaching or?
3:59 4:05 FEMALE: Um, I--I don't hope to get into teaching right away.  I hope to kind of just stay in research for a while, so.
4:05 4:06 MALE: Yeah.  I think it would be fascinating.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE: Yeah. Definitely. 
4:07 4:08 MALE: Wow.  Well it was nice meeting you.
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: It was nice meeting you, male311.
4:10 4:10 MALE: Nice meeting you.
4:10 4:10 FEMALE: Take good care.
