0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  Well, I like my name.
0:23 0:26 MALE:  I mean so they should follow you.
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  But then it wouldn't be unique, though.
0:28 0:33 MALE:  Oh, I see.  I see.  I see.  That's very important, yeah.
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  So what program are you in?
0:38 0:43 MALE:  Let me answer the three most people ask me the questions about first.
0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  Get it over with, okay.
0:49 0:58 MALE:  I'm from GSP studying Finance.  However, I'm not in an MBA program.  I'm in a Ph.D. program.  And I'm from Korea.
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  What year are you?
1:00 1:04 MALE:  Third year.  Oh, that was your third question, yeah.
1:06 1:09 FEMALE:  So I'm a first year Ph.D. Genetics student.
1:10 1:10 MALE:  Genetics.
1:11 1:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, School of Med.
1:13 1:15 MALE:  Making all [unintelligible].
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  A little bit of that.
1:18 1:20 MALE:  [unintelligible] technology.
1:21 1:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, but DNA work.  I might end up joining a Human Genial Lab.
1:29 1:29 MALE:  I see.
1:29 1:39 FEMALE:  So I really like sequent studies like that and they even taught us in a programming class last quarter [unintelligible].
1:40 1:58 MALE:  Uh huh.  I see.  Actually one of my good friends [unintelligible], Maine.  You know the Maine, the far north end of U.S. territory where they grow the lobsters?
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Right, okay.
2:00 2:24 MALE:  [unintelligible].  [unintelligible] 25% of the genetic meds are composed there.  Something like that.  Because you mentioned you're from genetics.
2:26 2:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, and Kansas has an interesting lab as well.  So Stanford Human Genial Center, its off campus and a lot of people work there and they collaborated on [unintelligible].  It was an international project.
2:42 2:43 MALE:  I see.
2:43 2:46 FEMALE:  Stanford, though, they refer to us as health.
2:46 2:48 MALE:  Which year are you in?
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  First year.
2:49 2:50 MALE:  First year.  I see.
2:50 2:51 FEMALE:  Exactly.
2:53 3:03 MALE:  It is also hard for you?  Bio-engineering was.  Genetics just [unintelligible].
3:04 3:06 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:03 3:43 MALE:  No, that was this year.  And then suddenly, my biology department in my college [unintelligible] just moved from [unintelligible].  I also traveled one year, however, I decided not to because you know this genetics [unintelligible] and you know what if you know I touched a limit that I cannot go beyond.
3:45 3:56 FEMALE:  Yeah, and so that's getting into technology and the ethics of [unintelligible] and stuff, but I don't actually quite understand how it works.  So the basic science and [unintelligible].
4:00 4:01 MALE:  You come about it yourself.
4:01 4:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:03 4:03 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
