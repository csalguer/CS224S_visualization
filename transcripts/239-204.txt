0:00 0:01 MALE:  Why ambitious?
0:01 0:07 FEMALE:  I know it, did you even get, did you even get to that?  Did you even get to that part of the conversation with them?  It's like...
0:07 0:10 MALE:  nameX [phonetic], why ambitious?  Why?  Why are you doing this to me?
0:10 0:22 FEMALE:  It's like, its like, are you going to save the world?  Yes, I am.  [laughter].  Oh, that's a 10 on my scale.  I feel like I should just start off with that, so then I will have ambitious on everybody's thing, you know?
0:22 0:25 MALE:  [laughter] that's right, I want to be president of the United States.  No, no, president of the world.
0:24 0:27 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's exactly.  Hi, I'm female239; I'm going to be president of the United States.
0:27 0:28 MALE:  Nice, me too.
0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  Oh, hey, darn it [laughter].
0:30 0:31 MALE:  No, no, that's alright, we can, we can...
0:31 0:39 FEMALE:  Or if it goes with the opposite of sincere you know, it's like, I planned on ambitious, but like, [laughter], one [unintelligible] [laughter].
0:40 0:43 MALE:  So if someone's being really funny are they also being sincere?
0:44 0:46 FEMALE:  That's a good point, I don't know.
0:45 0:51 MALE:  Because a lot of like humor, could be like developed out of sarcasm and, and, or understatement, hum.  I think we're in trouble.
0:48 1:05 FEMALE:  Oh, I know, that's true, yeah, hum, unless they're like sincerely funny [laughter].  I'll just make jokes about sincere people.
1:05 1:24 MALE:  [laughter] just start ripping on sincere people, sincere people.   I met this sincere guy this other day, just do this whole stand up routine.  Your dates like [laughter], I don't know, she was funny, but I didn't get a word in edgewise.  [laughter] so any way...
1:22 1:25 FEMALE:  [laughter] Oh gosh.
1:25 1:26 MALE:  So...
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  Anyway, hi, male204.
1:28 1:29 MALE:  Hi, female239.
1:30 1:32 FEMALE:  [laughter] oh, okay, well.
1:32 1:34 MALE:  [laughter] so, what's your major?
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Product design.
1:35 1:36 MALE:  Product design?
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, mechanical engineering.
1:37 1:38 MALE:  I know.
1:38 1:39 FEMALE:  You?
1:39 1:40 MALE:  I'm electrical.
1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  Cool.
1:41 1:47 MALE:  Yeah, so do you know, um, nameX nameX?  She's a mechanical engineer, she teaches all the design classes.
1:48 1:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think so, yeah I think so.
1:50 1:53 MALE:  She's got um; I mean there are probably like six girls in there, so.
1:53 1:55 FEMALE:  Well, I mean, the thing is, product design is different than mechanical engineering.
1:55 1:56 MALE:  Yeah.
1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  We, we kind of...
1:56 2:00 MALE:  Yeah, she takes, there's yeah, I know what you mean.
2:00 2:07 FEMALE:  We, yeah, we, yeah, and so people in mechanical engineering think they're in product design, no.  Or they think they take our classes, but actually our classes are pretty restricted.
2:07 2:08 MALE:  Oh, are they?
2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  Uh-hum, yeah.
2:09 2:10 MALE:  So that'd mean they're wrong.
2:12 2:17 FEMALE:  Oh, I'm just saying the classes that I take; I don't see them in it, [laughter], is all.  Anyway, whatever.
2:17 2:20 MALE:  So, it's, but it's technically part of the mechanical engineering department?
2:20 2:27 FEMALE: Uh-hum, yeah, I'm not sure; I think they might be changing that.  It's kind of like an integration of the art department and the engineering department.  I take a lot of studio classes and stuff too, so.
2:27 2:33 MALE:  Yeah, it seems like, it seems like, because mostly when I think of designers I think artists, not engineers.
2:33 2:34 FEMALE:  Uh-huh, right, right.
2:34 2:36 MALE:  They're like artists with a technical sort of side.
2:36 2:42 FEMALE:  Right, it's like engineers and the, they like to be called designers and artist, you know, they want, I don't know.  But enough about that.
2:42 2:47 MALE: I mean like, the designer's the guy that makes this, this microphone thing the most awkward thing in the world.
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, it's bad design, you know.
2:49 2:51 MALE:  And that takes creativity [laughter].
2:51 2:53 FEMALE:  Uh-hum, uh-huh, I like the electrical tape, that's a good one.
2:54 2:56 MALE:  Yeah, I, well, it's [unintelligible], you know.
2:56 2:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, uh, so...
2:57 2:58 MALE:  Electrical engineering gives you a more [unintelligible].
2:58 3:00 FEMALE:  Definitely.  You're doing PhD program?
3:00 3:01 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.
3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  That's exciting.
3:02 3:03 MALE:  So are you here for masters, or?
3:03 3:06 FEMALE:  Masters, yeah, they don't really have a PhD, it's not researched based and stuff, so.
3:06 3:10 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, it's uh; it seems like a more, like disciplined.
3:11 3:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, but I, I do like to incorporate some research into it.  I do value that.
3:15 3:17 MALE:  What type of research do you want to do as in that?
3:17 3:27 FEMALE: Well, a good question.  Um, I'm working on a proposal right now for the NSF grant to do research on the comic medium on education in university level.
3:28 3:30 MALE:  On comic medium educating university students?
3:28 4:08 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah, there's, there's a, um, a long story behind it.  I'm, I'm a comic artist.  I like draw a lot of comics, so what I like to do is, when I was a TA for a mechanics class last fall, I do hand outs with my characters.  And they teach like, like the concepts.  And I evaluated it and they, I got great responses and like just overwhelming, like, can you make more, can you do that, you know.  We want to see more.  And so, writing this proposal for a curriculum grant to see, evaluate the effects of using this medium to help teach difficult concepts, engaging for the students like, you know learn better.  So I think there's some research involved in that.  It's a little fuzzy, but it's, its exciting.
4:09 4:12 MALE:  Wow, I have like a million follow up questions, but my mind blew and so...
4:12 4:16 FEMALE:  I know, darn it.  Well I don't even know anything about you and I don't even know, like...
4:16 4:22 MALE:  I'm an electrical engineer from Virginia.  Um, I uh, like biking and hockey and moonlight walks on the beach and I'm a Capricorn.
4:20 4:25 FEMALE:  I love hockey.  Dude, I used to play hockey, I'm big into hockey.
4:24 4:25 MALE:  I'm a goal tender.
4:26 4:29 FEMALE:  Me too.  Yeah, I played like a cross goalie and stuff.  Uh, you're here.
4:32 4:33 MALE:  Oh, I'm sorry.
4:32 4:34 FEMALE:  Sorry, he's just a little late.
4:35 4:36 MALE:  I know, I'm, sorry, sorry, sorry.
4:35 4:36 FEMALE:  See you male204.
