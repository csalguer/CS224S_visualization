0:40 0:40 FEMALE: [laughter], fair enough.
0:41 0:46 MALE:	And actually have even been kind of going for a little bit of like mid grad school crises because I feel like I don't want to be the sit in front of the computer type of person for all my life.
0:46 0:46 FEMALE: Ooh, yeah, yeah.
0:47 0:57 MALE:	And I think it's -- I kind of think [unintelligible] having a Ph.D. and electronics [unintelligible] can still be useful and might end up going into like more math [unintelligible]. 
0:57 0:57 FEMALE: Right. 
0:57 1:00 MALE: But in the mean time I'm like trying to get my people skills and stuff outside of work [unintelligible].

1:20 1:24 FEMALE: It's been different.  I don't think I've ever done this before so, it's been -
1:25 1:27 MALE:	It's hard when you -- I mean I'm sure [unintelligible] people are kind of starting to blur together a little bit. 
1:27 1:29 FEMALE: Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna recall any of the faces; it's really sad [laughter].

1:44 1:45 MALE:	I mean socials one of the biggest aspects of business school.
1:45 1:46 FEMALE: Yeah, it is.  It's totally, it's a tiny little social bubble, it's crazy.

2:51 2:51 MALE:	Yeah, they're pretty [unintelligible].
2:52 2:54 FEMALE: All the time.
2:54 2:54 MALE:	And I'm sure like business schools -
2:57 3:02 FEMALE: Yeah.  No, I mean the business school's not bad, but what I did before business school was really bad.  So, um, I don't want to go back to that. 
3:02 3:02 MALE:	Okay, let's not talk about it.
3:03 3:05 FEMALE: No, no, no, it's fine.

3:31 3:34 MALE:	I mean I know that -- I know that they work really hard and they all get kind of caught up in the whole [unintelligible] company thing.  
3:35 3:35 FEMALE: Right.
3:35 3:45 MALE:	Which, I mean, you know, if that's important to them that's fine with me.  But it's just not my style I guess, you know.  Like always got to wait for the next promotion.
3:45 3:48 FEMALE: So what matters most to you in life as they ask us in the business school question.
3:48 3:49 MALE:	Ooh.
3:49 3:50 FEMALE: [laughter].

3:57 3:57 FEMALE: Okay.
3:57 4:10 MALE:	In like, I don't really even know what that means, but I want to -- I don't know I just have all these ideas of like making a difference through technology and whatever, that's kind of what matters to me, I guess, but I don't know how to do it yet.
