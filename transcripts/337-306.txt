0:35 0:38 FEMALE:  So, it's just like a break to like shut up or what?  So, we're not free to talk?

0:38 0:40 MALE:  Yeah.  Probably one six-minute deal, I guess.

0:40 0:46 FEMALE:  Okay.  So, yeah, I was just--oh, let's see, well, let me see.  Do you need water, food, or anything?

0:46 0:46 MALE:  No, I'm--I'm good.

0:47 0:53 FEMALE:  I'm fine too.  So--so, yeah, I, am just--where--where was I?  Yeah, I'm in the department of developmental bio [unintelligible].

0:54 0:54 MALE:  Okay.

0:55 0:58 FEMALE:  So, [unintelligible].  And that's right--it's in the medical school.

0:59 1:03 MALE:  Yeah.  My--my knowledge of medicine is like zip.

1:03 1:06 FEMALE:  I've [unintelligible] always in medical school, but we're not really doing the MD stuff so.

1:07 1:08 MALE:  Yeah, I understand.

1:08 1:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, yeah that was--it was okay.  And are you in the Ph.D. program here?

1:14 1:15 MALE:  No, I'm in the masters [unintelligible] program.

1:15 1:17 FEMALE:  So, you'll be done soon or how long--how long would that take?

1:17 1:21 MALE:  I'll have--I'll have another year and then I'll probably be here for--working in the Bay Area for a few years.

1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  I see.

1:23 1:25 MALE:  I'm not leaving Stanford.  I actually want to come back to the [unintelligible] in another like two years.

1:25 1:27 FEMALE:  Oh, wow, so you just like school?

1:27 1:27 MALE:  Yeah.

1:28 1:34 FEMALE:  I don't know if I--I--I don't know--I think I'm ready to leave the school 'cause I think I've been here for like at this school for too long.

1:35 1:35 MALE:  How long have you been here?

1:35 1:45 FEMALE:  Well, 'cause on the grad I'm done--I was in grad school for almost six years and then I have been in post doc for like three years and then it's just like school, school, school.  So, I think I'm ready for the real world.

1:45 1:46 MALE:  Yes, I--I--I know.

1:47 1:47 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:47 1:51 MALE:  And for me it was like, okay, well, I am going to work like forever, you know, work, take a break, come back to school.

1:51 1:54 FEMALE:  That's right because school--like, [unintelligible] working and then going to school is like a brick, right?

1:55 1:58 MALE:  Yeah, that's why I worked about a year and a half, two years at it.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  And you just [unintelligible].

1:59 1:59 MALE:  I came back to school.

2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  That's nice. 

2:00 2:03 MALE:  I came back to school, be here, go back work again, back to school.

2:04 2:07 FEMALE:  Which is like a good thing to do 'cause you can take a break and you advance yourself and you learn something new.

2:07 2:08 MALE:  Yeah, absolutely.

2:08 2:11 FEMALE:  What did you like change direction after you go [unintelligible] it's like [unintelligible]?

2:12 2:15 MALE:  Well, last time I did.  It's sort of--it's like moving on.  I was a CS major.

2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

2:16 2:20 MALE:  Now, sort of MS [unintelligible] half engineering and half business school and then the full [unintelligible].

2:20 2:21 FEMALE:  And then [unintelligible] business school you think?

2:21 2:21 MALE:  Yeah, probably.

2:21 2:23 FEMALE:  So, are you are more interested in the business side, I assume?

2:24 2:26 MALE:  Yes, I am [unintelligible] not--not really a programmer person.

2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Right.

2:27 2:29 MALE:  I am not somebody who is like--likes to sit in one place.

2:29 2:31 FEMALE:  I know what you mean yeah 'cause I [unintelligible].

2:32 2:33 MALE:  We start.  Okay.

2:33 2:54 FEMALE:  So, yeah, I think--I--I figure out I'm not really into doing research all the time, so I might eventually.  But I think the first step will still be doing what you know what [unintelligible].  Because eventually I'll move away, who knows.  Or I hope I can just [unintelligible] yeah, just move away from doing [unintelligible].  It's kind of boring [unintelligible] I don't know I'm just not used to [unintelligible] 'cause you don't really interact with a lot of people.

2:56 3:00 MALE:  Yeah, and that's [unintelligible] like yeah I just love being around people and hang around 

3:00 3:02 FEMALE:  So, business is definitely what you--where you're going?

3:02 3:03 MALE:  Yeah, maybe bureaucracy, but I don't know.

3:04 3:10 FEMALE:  Well, like, yeah, I guess there are pros and cons [unintelligible] that right [unintelligible] with politics [unintelligible].  But, you know, I think there's politics everywhere.

3:10 3:10 MALE:  I--I--I--

3:11 3:19 FEMALE:  Even in the school when I--when I first started grad school I was so naive thinking [unintelligible] love each other no politics at all, but I'm not sure.

3:19 3:20 MALE:  No, it doesn't work that way.

3:20 3:21 FEMALE:  I agree, no.  

3:21 3:24 MALE:  I figured that out the last years of my under graduate.

3:25 3:25 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

3:27 3:27 MALE:  So, what do you do for fun?

3:28 3:38 FEMALE:  Well, um, I--I like dating, I like dining out, I like to watch movies and hang out with friends.  I'm not too athletic, so I don't do a lot of like sporting stuff.  How about you?

3:39 3:49 MALE:  I love sports, but I've become too [unintelligible] and I was into valley guards theater, but [unintelligible] I was doing a bunch of stuff.  I was in professional theater.  I was going to join ESPN [unintelligible] before coming here.

3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  Really?  Wow.

3:51 4:02 MALE:  But, uh, I kind of figured out this-- this worked out better maybe.  And here I just like hanging out with friends and that kind of stuff.  Do anything but just be with friends.

4:02 4:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, I just like hanging out, I just like chilling, but I [unintelligible] it's fun.  So, how long have you been in the states?

4:08 4:10 MALE:  Not long, six months, seven months.

4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  Oh, really?

4:11 4:11 MALE:  Yeah.

4:11 4:13 FEMALE:  Oh, so you did your, um, under grad back in India?

4:13 4:14 MALE:  In India, yeah.  Both in India.  

4:15 4:17 FEMALE:  That can't be four minutes, right?

4:18 4:20 MALE:  Yeah.  Somebody said--I think we're starting.  

4:20 4:20 FEMALE:  Again?

4:21 4:21 MALE:  Again.

4:22 4:22 FEMALE:  Oh, they will yell.

4:23 4:24 MALE:  Yeah, they will just yell.

4:24 4:27 FEMALE:  Oh, so you said you're planning on working here for a few years?

4:27 4:28 MALE:  For a while.

4:28 4:29 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] stay in the states?

4:29 4:31 MALE:  But my--it--if you were to ask my interest I just like to work everywhere around the world.

4:31 4:32 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  

4:32 4:33 MALE:  Yeah.

4:33 4:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, 'cause I'm originally from Hong Kong and--

4:35 4:37 MALE:  Yeah, go to Hong Kong.  Yeah, go to Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Europe.

4:37 4:39 FEMALE:  Wow.  So, you just like adventuring, exploring?

4:40 4:42 MALE:  I--I just love learning cultures and people.

4:42 4:45 FEMALE:  Cool.  That--that means business is your way to go too.

4:45 4:46 MALE:  Pardon?

4:46 4:47 FEMALE:  Business is definitely your way to go.

4:48 4:51 MALE:  Yes.  I kind of figured I'd find a job which involves a lot of traveling.

4:51 5:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, oh, wow.  So, yeah, okay, so I'm kind of from the opposite [unintelligible] I'm not really big on traveling too much 'cause--oh, I don't know why.  It's like if you're taking a plane you have to be down at the airport and then it's just like you get stuck [unintelligible].  And I like my old bed a little bit better than a hotel bed.

5:08 5:09 MALE:  Yeah, so that's why I said work.

5:10 5:10 FEMALE:  Work.

5:11 5:15 MALE:  Yeah, work in different places where you have to actually live there and get to know people.

5:15 5:16 FEMALE:  I see, not like traveling every week, right?

5:16 5:18 MALE:  No.  No.  I--I can't do that.

5:19 5:20 FEMALE:  So, probably no milk and cow town for you.

5:20 5:21 MALE:  No.

5:21 5:23 FEMALE:  It's like no I don't want to travel every week.

5:24 5:29 MALE:  Unfortunately, I think I may end up there during [unintelligible] I'm actually--hopefully--I'm starting in Microsoft Office this summer for three months.

5:29 5:30 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.

5:31 5:33 MALE:  If it works out I will probably get into that.

5:32 5:33 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

5:33 5:33 MALE:  Yeah.

5:34 5:37 FEMALE:  That's nice.  So, do you think you'll eventually move home or...?

5:36 5:38 MALE:  I will.  My family is there, I guess.

5:40 5:40 FEMALE:  I see.

5:38 5:45 MALE:  But I'm not [unintelligible] the world is one big place right, I mean, you just--

5:45 5:47 FEMALE:  Eventually, your home is home, right?

5:48 5:48 MALE:  Home is home.

5:48 6:03 FEMALE:  I agree with you, yeah.  So, yeah, I haven't decided, like, I never rule out the possibility of people moving back home, but right now I'm thinking I'm still trying to find a job here.  Because California--California is almost like a second home for me, so I like it and I do have some relatives in the area.  So, it's not--

6:04 6:05 MALE:  You have been here for so long absolutely, I agree.

6:05 6:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, I--I--I like it though.

6:07 6:11 MALE:  It's a beautiful place.  I probably--when I actually go back home for a vacation--

6:12 6:12 FEMALE:  They break you.

6:13 6:18 MALE:  Yeah.  It would have actually been a year and a half I am going back next December end--Christmas--this Christmas.

6:18 6:18 FEMALE:  Okay.  

6:19 6:19 MALE:  Right.

6:19 6:20 FEMALE:  For how long you said?

6:21 6:23 MALE:  It would have been a year and a half before I actually was going home.

6:23 6:25 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  So, you probably home sick a little bit?

6:26 6:33 MALE:  No, I will be like culture shocked.  I--I enjoyed it.  I mean, I was--I was getting a little bored at home.

6:34 6:35 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] people have to work and just like hang out.

6:35 6:41 MALE:  Yeah, it's--it's--as I said, you know, I like to travel and you learn--new--meet new people and just get to know--

6:42 6:42 FEMALE:  So, like--

6:43 6:45 MALE:  --[unintelligible] it's too monotonous.  It's just too monotonous back home.

6:45 6:52 FEMALE:  I see.  Well, I actually like--when I--whenever I go home I--I usually have a good time just seeing old friends and just like--I--I--

6:53 6:56 MALE:  That will be fun [unintelligible] when I visiting home [unintelligible].

6:56 7:03 FEMALE:  Well, it's very different when you go home as a visitor and people will treat you like, oh, you're moving back for like--and do you have a [unintelligible], yes I do.

7:04 7:06 MALE:  Yes, I would be able to answer you.

7:06 7:18 FEMALE:  It's always fun.  But I--I enjoy my home a lot just for a vacation.  It's just that--and I guess when you go back for a vacation you don't have to do anything.  You don't have to work, so it's kind of relaxing too.  It's very different than when you actually live there.

7:19 7:22 MALE:  I--I--I'm [unintelligible] total workaholic [unintelligible].

7:22 7:24 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, so you're not comfortable.

7:24 7:27 MALE:  [unintelligible] workaholic, yes [unintelligible]. so when I go back it's like okay what am I going to do, what am I going to do.

7:27 7:29 FEMALE:  So, kind of like [unintelligible] I need something to do.

7:29 7:37 MALE:  Yeah, work all the time it's just--just work like boring stuff.  It's just be active, just do some--something productive in life.

7:37 7:43 FEMALE:  I see.  Well, then troubling working everywhere it's just tasting--you just got to taste each culture, right?

7:43 7:44 MALE:  Yeah, absolutely.

7:44 7:45 FEMALE:  It'll be fun.

7:45 7:50 MALE:  Hopefully, I--I get to do that.  So, what brought you here?  A friend pushed you into this dating [unintelligible].

7:51 8:04 FEMALE:  Well, a friend of mine told me because he knows the organizer and they said [unintelligible] know her and they said like they [unintelligible] short [unintelligible].  I think somebody dropped out at the last minute.  So, I heard about it last night and I said, sure I'll come.  This is your first meeting thing?

8:05 8:05 MALE:  Yes.

8:05 8:12 FEMALE:  Me too.  [unintelligible] okay, sure I'll come out and meet new people because I don't really get to meet a lot of people outside of my department.  So, you know, it will be fun.

8:14 8:17 MALE:  Do you like to date a lot or you don't get a chance--time?

8:17 8:20 FEMALE:  Um, I don't get to meet enough people so.

8:20 8:20 MALE:  Oh, okay.

8:20 8:21 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

8:21 8:22 MALE:  Yeah, this should be a fun place to meet people.

8:22 8:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, nice meeting you nameX [unintelligible].

8:23 8:24 MALE:  It's great to meet you.
