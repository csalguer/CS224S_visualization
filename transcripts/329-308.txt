0:14 0:14 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you--what do you do?
0:19 0:22 MALE:  I just finished, a day ago, um my second year of law school.
0:19 0:19 FEMALE:  Oh--
0:23 0:24 MALE:  [interposing] So how about yourself?
0:20 0:20 FEMALE:  --congratulations.  
0:24 0:25 MALE:  Thank you.  Oh yeah.
0:21 0:23 FEMALE:  You finished all those finals.  Some people.
0:26 0:29 MALE:  Oh my God.  I'm totally super fried.  But it--it's great to be done with that.
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  Good.
0:30 0:31 MALE:  What about yourself?  What do you study?
0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  Um product design.  Do you--oh, you don't want a cookie?
0:33 0:36 MALE:  No, but I do definitely.  The second time around I was really [unintelligible].
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Oh, I'll ask if there's a fourth and fifth, too.
0:38 0:43 MALE:  Well, they don't--I'll give in.  I have no willpower and I'm really susceptible to peer pressure.  That is sweet.  What are you doing in product design?
0:40 0:45 FEMALE:  Um I make things.  In fact, I'm sewing right now and basically uh um seamstress.  
0:50 0:50 MALE:  That's sweet.
0:46 0:51 FEMALE:  I'm a glorified--extremely glorified seamstress who went to Stanford to study sewing.
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Well, I mean--
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  [interposing] It's doing great.
0:57 1:01 MALE:  --it's okay.  Well, if you work for the right, you know.  Are you uh--but it can be just like, you know, [unintelligible].
0:57 1:08 FEMALE:  Um I--you actually make a lot of things.  I made things out of plastic.  Made things out of wood and metal and all that other good stuff.  It just happens to be my thesis is on currently on skirts, and so I'm making skirts.  So I've been doing a lot of sewing, so.
1:12 1:13 MALE:  Is this a masters degree or--
1:09 1:11 FEMALE:  [interposing] Masters program, yeah.
1:14 1:14 MALE:  And then?
1:11 1:19 FEMALE:  And then I graduate and try to get a job, which basically is impossible 'cause you know they don't hire designers, and when they do, they don't give you any money 'cause their poor and, you know, you've--
1:23 1:23 MALE:  [interposing] Oh for Pete's sake.
1:20 1:28 FEMALE:  You basically are like a starving artist, but you're even lower on the totem pole because you still have to work for people.  You can't even work for yourself.  So you're even worse.  You're like in the dumps.
1:31 1:33 MALE:  Well, I'll tell you this--
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  [interposing] It sucks.
1:33 1:36 MALE:  I mean, you have an awful life ahead of you.  There's no question about that.  But--
1:33 1:34 FEMALE:  [interposing] The poorest miserable life in the world.
1:38 1:49 MALE:  --you know, I knew some people that did product design undergrad, and while all that applied to them, they had like really cool bookshelves made of books and things.  So you know, assuming someone can loan you some materials.  Obviously you won't be able to afford them.
1:46 1:54 FEMALE:  I assume that I need very, very rich benefactors and patrons like you who will be a rich lawyer while I'm a starving designer.  And I--
1:58 1:58 MALE:  [interposing] Well, see my plan was--
1:54 1:59 FEMALE:  --need to find all these people that have a ton of money that I can just be like give me money, and I'll give you something.
2:03 2:07 MALE:  Well, I know.  See, my plan is to marry wealthy and then like go do good work.
2:02 2:04 FEMALE:  Your plan is to marry wealthy.  You're a lawyer, hello.
2:09 2:10 MALE:  So try to sell some skirts and we'll talk.  [laughter].
2:06 2:14 FEMALE:  I might say that you have some problems 'cause lawyers should not be looking for someone wealthy.  Lawyers are the wealthy ones.  If you are looking for someone wealthy, there's a problem.
2:18 2:18 MALE:  This is--
2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  [interposing] A serious problem.
2:19 2:20 MALE:  --the most depressing experience I've had in weeks now.
2:17 2:19 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  This is depressing.  This is just sad.  [laughter].
2:22 2:24 MALE:  I totally get it.  So what did you do before your masters degree?
2:21 2:27 FEMALE:  Um I did consulting, and I did software startup, and then I went to Spain for a year and studied art.
2:32 2:33 MALE:  That's sounds sweet.  Where were you consulting?
2:30 2:31 FEMALE:  Um I worked at Mercer.  Do you know them?
2:35 2:36 MALE:  Yeah, definitely.
2:32 2:32 FEMALE:  I still--yeah.
2:36 2:40 MALE:  I was, you know, econ, undergrad, did the consulting interviews.
2:36 2:38 FEMALE:  Cool.  What [unintelligible]?  What have you done before?
2:43 2:48 MALE:  I did product management at Microsoft and then, you know, decided to get out of business.  But it was cool.
2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  Why did you decide law?
2:49 2:57 MALE:  The honest story is uh so you know how it is when you start a job.  In the first couple of weeks, you're just like working all the time trying to figure out what's going on.
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:58 3:16 MALE:  So I was doing that, and I'm up in Seattle and I don't know anybody, so I go to Borders one day.  And uh I pick up this book like 100 things you can do with a law degree, just one of those like strange random moments that--and uh I started looking at it, and particularly a section on--on careers and entertain, like people who are running movie studios.  And I thought that sounds fabulous.  So--
3:12 3:13 FEMALE:  [interposing] Is that what you want to do?
3:18 3:31 MALE:  Well no.  Uh this is why it's a weird story.  So anyway, it got me to apply to law school.  Okay.  Uh I deferred for a year.  By the time I got here, I decided I had other interests other than law, but that was the thing that precipitated me applying to law school and thinking about law.
3:27 3:27 FEMALE:  Was entertainment?
3:33 3:41 MALE:  Yeah.  Like you know, start in the entertainment laws, switch over to more of the business-side of the industry.  Do like the business side of the entertainment industry but--
3:37 3:40 FEMALE:  [interposing] But then you'll make money, so you don't need to marry rich.  That was all a lie and a scam.
3:44 3:46 MALE:  But that was under the--that was under the--the old plan.
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  You were just lying to me weren't you?
3:47 3:53 MALE:  No.  Now why did you leave consulting and the software startup, not to mention the year in Spain, to do this?
3:50 3:53 FEMALE:  'Cause I don't like doing this.
3:58 3:59 MALE:  Did you have like a background in product design?
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  My--no, my background was applied math and economics, so.
4:01 4:03 MALE:  Oh.  Well that's good.  I want software.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Okay.  That was funny.
4:05 4:08 MALE:  Well thank you.  I feel awful about myself now, but--
4:05 4:09 FEMALE:  [interposing] I think that you should feel guilty and miserable and, you know, embarrassed and hide your head in the dirt.  [laughter].
4:14 4:19 MALE:  Succeeded.  Oh, okay.  Anyway, it's really good to meet you.
4:15 4:21 FEMALE:  Good to see you.  Bye bye.  [unintelligible].  Wait, what was your name?  
4:26 4:26 MALE:  male308.
4:22 4:23 FEMALE:  I'll have to write it down.  Okay.  Thank you.
