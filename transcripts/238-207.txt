00:01  00:02	MALE:  [horn] Hello, female238.
00:02  00:02	FEMALE:  Hi.
00:03  00:04	MALE:  I'm male207, with a G.
00:04  00:05	FEMALE:  male207, oh, I said Gregory before.  
00:06  00:06	MALE:  No, terrible spelling of my name.
00:07  00:08	FEMALE:  My brother's name is male207, but with a J.
00:09  00:10	MALE:  The right way of spelling it, sorry but ah --
00:10  00:11	FEMALE:  How did that happen?
00:12  00:13	MALE:  Well, let me tell you a little story.
00:14  00:14	FEMALE:  [laughter]
00:15  00:37	MALE:  You know male207, male207, III a great name.  But anyway so they -- my parents wanted to name me male207, but then my grandfather who was male207 Senior  was putting pressure on them at the last minute so he wanted me called male207, so they said we'll name him male207 and keep the name going.  But then call him male207.  And they figured if I changed it to a G keep the same initial.  I mean, it doesn't -- I don't really buy it.
00:38  00:39	FEMALE:  What's on your birth certificate, male207.
00:39  00:39	MALE:  male207, III.
00:40  00:42	FEMALE:  But you go by male207, it's like a nickname.
00:43  00:43	MALE:  Like a nickname.
00:44  00:45	FEMALE:  But can't you just decide to spell it with a J if you want?
00:45  00:57	MALE:  I have this thing up on my door at home that says G is for -- when I was really little --.  G is for grapes, giraffe something else and male207.  It's just like that's just the way I think [unintelligible].
00:58  00:58	FEMALE:  Right.
00:59  01:02	MALE:  You know, not then right.  You don't really get to choose your name you know, that's just what they call you and teach you how to write it, you just kind of learn to accept it right?
01:03  01:05	FEMALE:  Yeah, right.  And are you at that?
01:06  01:14	MALE:  So --.  I went through a phase where I wanted to switch male207 to J, but male207 and then I also went through a phase where I just wanted to be male207 and never -- I think of myself as male207 with a G, all there is to it.  
01:15  01:15	FEMALE:  Okay.
01:16  01:17	MALE:  Sorry, to say.
01:19  01:20	FEMALE:  What are you going to do.
01:21  01:23	MALE:  I'm powerless, powerless [laughter].
01:24  01:25	FEMALE:  So, are you having a good time tonight?
01:26  01:27	MALE:  Its actually pretty fun.  Do you like it?
01:28  01:31	FEMALE:  Yeah, I do.  I think I'm getting a bit um, I don't know --
01:33  01:34	MALE:   I feel like everything is blurring together.
01:34  01:36	FEMALE:  Like I'm starting to blur, but um, --
01:37  01:38	MALE:  I feel like when I feel it's like, I'll write down all fives down the whole way you know.
01:39  01:44	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  So, anyway um --
01:45  01:46	MALE:  Has anyone said anything clever yet?  What's the most clever things someone has said?
01:47  01:56	FEMALE:  There's been some cleverness.  I wouldn't really call it -- it wasn't requiring too much context to make it properly clever, but yeah.
01:57  01:58	MALE:  So no just like radically creative things. 
01:59  01:59	FEMALE:  No, nothing --
02:00  02:02	MALE:  Just the standard this is what I do, this is what you do.
02:02  02:14	FEMALE:  Exactly.  My friend -- I have one friend that has done this before and she told me I should have a question that I ask, like off beat questions like if you were a color what color would be or something.  And I said, okay do you have any more advice, because I'm not taking that.
02:15  02:17	MALE:  [laughter] yeah.
02:18  02:19	FEMALE:  Yeah, no I'm not doing that, but um --
02:20  02:36	MALE:  So I did this before in the fall through Raines.  And one of the things I did was towards the end and having some fun was, spy on the people in front of me.  I haven't been doing it this time, but find out what the people in front of me were saying.  People kind of say the same things and then like ripping off what they said, so just like saying some funny crack about someone had said.
02:37  02:38	FEMALE:  Oh, well that guy is from Australia.
02:39  02:39	MALE:  Okay.
02:40  02:41	FEMALE:  He just ran a triathlon.
02:41  02:43	MALE:  Okay, I'm sure he's telling everyone [unintelligible].
02:44  02:52	FEMALE:  No, I asked, I asked him how he got the sunburn and he was sunburned.  So you might want to say I'm male207 and I have sunburn because I ran the triathlon.
02:53  02:53	MALE:  Oh yeah.
02:54  02:55	FEMALE:  So you're set up for that end.
02:56  02:56	MALE:  Yeah, that's [laughter] --
02:57  02:58	FEMALE:  Um, I think that's the guy.
02:59  03:00	MALE:  Do you know any of the other girls?
03:00  03:02	FEMALE:  Um, I brought a friend, I kidnapped -- I forced someone to come with me.  But we're not even sitting next to each other, so it's not really as fun as I though it would be.
03:08  03:09	MALE:  Have you checked in on her yet?
03:10  03:10	FEMALE:  No, she's --
03:11  03:12	MALE:  Well, there's no time, its like --
03:12  03:17	FEMALE:  Yeah, I can't check, yeah.  And she's letter C so she's like all the way down there.  So anyway.  What are you going to do?
03:18  03:27	MALE:  Pretty fun though, but I guess blurring thing is interesting I don't know how to deal with it; it's like a little bit more time.
03:28  03:29	FEMALE:  I think less people, fewer people whatever.
03:30  03:30	MALE:  Yeah.  
03:31  03:32	FEMALE:  Whatever the grammar for that is.
03:32  03:34	MALE:  That's okay.  I'm an engineer I don't speak English.
03:35  03:38	FEMALE:  I'm a linguist so I'm supposed to you know.  
03:39  03:40	MALE:  Ooo, so does that mean you can recognize accents and stuff?
03:41  03:42	FEMALE:  Some, I'm not very talented at it.
03:45  03:45	MALE:  [unintelligible].
03:46  03:47	FEMALE:  But I can tell you where you're not from.
03:47  03:48	MALE:  Where am I not from?
03:48  03:49	FEMALE:  You're not from California.
03:49  03:50	MALE:  True.
03:51  03:53	FEMALE:  You're not from -- you're not from Ohio, Kentucky or Indiana.
03:54  03:55	MALE:  Correct.  Not from the Midwest.
03:56  03:59	FEMALE:  No, that's not the whole Midwest, hold on.
04:00  04:01	MALE:  Well not Minnesota.
04:01  04:06	FEMALE:  Yeah, you're not from Minnesota.  You're not from North Dakota.  You might be from Connecticut.
04:07  04:09	MALE:  Okay, my mom's from Connecticut.   I do say Aunt.
04:10  04:16	FEMALE:  You might be from -- you might be from Texas.
04:17  04:17	MALE:  Really?
04:18  04:27	FEMALE:  You don't have a southern feeling, but I've found [horn] from people that whenever I can't place them it turns out there from Texas and they moved there like when there were seven [horn].
04:28  04:29	MALE:  D.C. area, Virginia.
04:30  04:31	FEMALE:  That's where I was going to go next.  
04:31  04:31	MALE:  How about you?
04:32  04:36	FEMALE:  I'm from Cincinnati, but I lived in D.C. for like six years, so.
04:37  04:38	MALE:  Cincinnati, the natty.
04:38  04:39	FEMALE:  The natty, it's a nasty natty.
04:39  04:40	MALE:  There you go.  Cool, it was good to meet you.
04:41  04:41	FEMALE:  Yeah, you too.
04:42  04:43	MALE:  Moving on with the blur.
