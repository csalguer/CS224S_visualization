0:13 0:17 MALE: Right, okay, good, you're M.  Excellent.  Are we supposed to not talk until-- 
0:07 0:07 FEMALE: I think so.
0:18 0:19 MALE: --she gets to [unintelligible].  Okay, well--
0:08 0:10 FEMALE: Because otherwise I'm sure they'll crucify us, so-- 
0:21 0:22 MALE: Well, in the name of science, I will.
0:12 0:12 FEMALE: [laughter] 
0:24 0:25 MALE: Oh, man.
0:14 0:18 FEMALE: Yes.  So we're-- straight to station M, right?
0:29 0:29 MALE: I think so.
0:20 0:20 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
0:32 0:34 MALE: We move, do we, I guess we're move in alphabetical order, right?  
0:26 0:28 FEMALE: Yeah, you move, I stay where I am.
0:38 0:39 MALE: Yeah.  [pause]  Okay.
[horn]
0:37 0:42 FEMALE: It's so annoying.  And so I guess we start quiet.  
0:52 0:52 MALE: Wow.  Okay, I'm male313.
0:42 0:43 FEMALE: female333, nice to meet you [laughter]
0:54 0:54 MALE: What's your name?
0:45 0:45 FEMALE: female333.
0:56 0:56 MALE: Let me write it here.  
0:46 0:47 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:57 0:57 MALE: I can't actually hear.
0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Sorry, M-I-R-I-C-A.  
1:00 1:00 MALE: Sweet.
0:50 0:52 FEMALE: Uh, it's kind of contrary to its spelling, but yeah.  So.
1:03 1:05 MALE: Awsome.  So, this is kind of crazy.
0:55 0:56 FEMALE: It's kind of weird.  
1:06 1:07 MALE: Done anything like this before?
0:57 0:58 FEMALE: I never have.  You?
1:08 1:09 MALE: I've actually been here a couple times, but-- 
0:59 1:00 FEMALE: Really?
1:10 1:16 MALE: I'm friends with [unintelligible], actually I met her at speed dating.  Sorry [unintelligible] I revealed that.  So, you know, I was helping her get more people.
1:06 1:16 FEMALE: [laughter] That's hilarious.  That's nice of you.  I um, I heard about it, they were leaving flyers in front of people's doors, so I was like, oh, sounds fun.  Sounds very time efficient, so yeah, I might as well go.
1:25 1:27 MALE: Yeah, I mean, it's two hours out of your life, right, in the worst case.
1:17 1:21 FEMALE: Exactly, exactly.  Might as well do it.  So what department are you in?
1:31 1:31 MALE: Uh, computer science.
1:22 1:23 FEMALE: Okay.  Masters or Ph.D. or-- ?
1:33 1:34 MALE: Ph.D. I think.  
1:24 1:24 FEMALE: Alright.
1:35 1:38 MALE: That's the plan, I don't know, you know, I always think I'm okay.  I'm just going to, you know, I'm just going to bail, I'm just going to take the masters and run.
1:29 1:30 FEMALE: Do you know Bob McGrew [phonetic] by any chance?
1:41 1:42 MALE: I know him, yeah, blonde, right?
1:32 1:34 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, he's a friend of mine from undergrad.
1:43 1:45 MALE: Yeah, I sort of know him.  Cool.  Where'd you guys go?
1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Stanford.
1:46 1:47 MALE: Oh, okay, cool.
1:37 1:38 FEMALE: Didn't really go far.
1:48 1:49 MALE: Very nice.  What program are you in?
1:40 1:49 FEMALE: Medicine and neuroscience, so M.D./Ph.D.  So I'll be here for a while, because-- four years of undergrad, four years of the med school and presumably four years of Ph.D., so 12 years total.
1:58 1:59 MALE: Yeah, wow.
1:49 1:50 FEMALE: [laughter]
2:00 2:01 MALE: Are you getting sick of Stanford yet?
1:52 1:58 FEMALE: Not yet, but I'm only halfway into it, so I very well may.  [laughter]  Yeah.  
2:07 2:08 MALE: Okay, cool, very interesting.
1:58 1:59 FEMALE: So like where are you from?
2:10 2:12 MALE: Uh, Houston, Texas, originally.  I went to UT Austin.
2:02 2:04 FEMALE: Okay.  That's awesome.
2:13 2:16 MALE: Undergrad, so-- West Coast is kind of a change, I don't know.
2:05 2:19 FEMALE: I'm sure.  Although, like I think a lot of people, a lot of undergrads at Stanford are from Texas, so how feeling like, you know, for Texans, it's kind of like go far, but not really, like it's less, still a cultural abyss [unintelligible] the east coast, you know.   
2:27 2:30 MALE: It's still kind of in the west, yeah.  Yeah.  East coast is, yeah.
2:19 2:23 FEMALE: That kind of thing.  Just like still kind of like lots of land, you know, I don't know. 
2:33 2:36 MALE: Yeah, and I tell you, I- I like the space, you know.  
2:26 2:26 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:36 2:38 MALE: I'm not a big fan of super crowded, super urban places.  
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:40 2:40 MALE: Where are you from?
2:30 2:31 FEMALE: I'm from Croatia originally.  
2:41 2:41 MALE: Oh, cool.
2:32 2:33 FEMALE: And so, I--
2:43 2:44 MALE: Why did you come over here, for undergrad?
2:34 2:35 FEMALE: Yeah, so when I was 18, yeah.  
2:45 2:46 MALE: Sweet, very nice.  
2:37 2:37 FEMALE: I know.  
2:48 2:51 MALE: So, have you been following all the political stuff in- in Croatia?
2:41 2:55 FEMALE: Not very thoroughly, not recently, no, like I mean, like I kind of would, my parents will tell me when something more important happens, but honestly, I just try not to focus too much on it.  It's like, healthier not to, it's stressful, so-- Yeah.  
3:06 3:08 MALE: Yeah.  Cool, alright.  So you plan to stay over here?  Or how does that work?
2:59 3:21 FEMALE: Yeah, so I'm actually uh, have a green card, so I'm, I'm actually going through the process of getting my citizenship fairly soon, so-- Maybe from a month from now I will be a U.S. citizen, so yeah, I'm definitely staying.  Especially like, oh, it doesn't make much sense to like get educated here, like, well [unintelligible] actually paid for, but you know, like to may for an M.D. degree like, which costs a lot, and then go and practice in Croatia, where you make no money-- 
3:31 3:33 MALE: And then you've got all those debts.
3:21 3:26 FEMALE: As opposed to doing it the other way around, where I'd say med school in Croatia, med school in Croatia's free, and like you'd make here a lot of money, so-- 
3:36 3:37 MALE: It's free in Croatia.
3:27 3:27 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:38 3:38 MALE: Wow.
3:28 3:31 FEMALE: Yeah.  Well, uh, all universities are free, so, yeah.  
3:41 3:41 MALE: Wow, that's cool.
3:32 3:36 FEMALE: Are you like planning to go into academia?  Or are we talking more like-- 
3:45 3:49 MALE: I think industry, actually, which is weird, I mean, everybody's like, "Okay, why are you getting a Ph.D."
3:39 3:39 FEMALE: Right, exactly.
3:50 3:52 MALE: But the stuff I do, you kind of have to have a Ph.D.  
3:42 3:43 FEMALE: Uh-huh, what do you do?
3:52 3:54 MALE: I worked for a year in industry doing verification.  
3:45 3:45 FEMALE: Uh-huh.
3:55 3:58 MALE: And all the guys in my group have Ph.D.s, it's kind of everybody's doing it.
3:48 3:52 FEMALE: Okay, everybody's doing it, so I might as well.  [laughter]  Jump the bandwagon.  Okay.  
4:00 4:02 MALE: Alright, I'll- I'll follow the crowd.  Yeah, exactly.
3:53 3:54 FEMALE: That's [unintelligible]
4:03 4:08 MALE: So, with M.D./Ph.D., is that research?  Are you planning to practice?  How does that work?
3:56 4:11 FEMALE: Probably research, so I research, I mean, I could go either way.  Um, I'm seeing myself really doing more likely, like mostly research, maybe a little bit of medial practice.  We'll see, really kind of depends, I mean like, I could make some sort of sweeping statement about what I'm going to do six years from now when I finish this-- 
4:21 4:22 MALE: Yeah, but who knows?  Exactly.
4:12 4:21 FEMALE: Who knows?  [laughter]  So, I prefer it to kind of keep things open, 'cause I really don't know, and like any kind of attempt to make a deci-- like a definite answer would probably be BS, so.
4:31 4:34 MALE: Yeah, excellent.  So do you do one first and then the other?
4:24 4:25 FEMALE: So I did, uh-- 
4:36 4:36 MALE: Like you do M.D.
4:26 4:31 FEMALE: So I just finished my second year in med school, and then I'm doing my Ph.D., and then last year's med school.  
4:42 4:46 MALE: So you can't get the M.D. and go, "Haha, I'm not actually doing the Ph.D., thanks for paying for my M.D.," and then leave.
4:37 4:42 FEMALE: I mean, some people do do quit [horn] in which case they don't have to pay back, so that's okay.  
4:52 4:53 MALE: Oh, that's sneaky.  Alright.
4:43 4:45 FEMALE: I know.  [laughter]  Cool.  Well, nice meeting you.  
4:55 4:56 MALE: Nice meeting you, good luck tonight.
4:46 4:56 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:56 4:57 MALE: Thanks.
4:57 4:58 FEMALE: Was your name male313?
4:58 5:00 MALE: male313, yeah.  Make sure the microphone isn't covering it.
