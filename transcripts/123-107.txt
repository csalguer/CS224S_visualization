0:00 0:01 MALE:  Hey.
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  Hi.  female123.
0:02 0:03 MALE: male107 [phonetic].
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  male107?
0:05 0:05 MALE:  Mm-hmm.
0:15 0:17 FEMALE:  That's a very unusual name.  What does it mean?
0:09 0:18 MALE:  It means the sun god.  It's from India, my father [unintelligible] means the sun god basically.
0:25 0:27 FEMALE:  Your parents gave you--they had high expectations, huh?
0:19 0:25 MALE:  Yeah.  They were like--they gave me my [unintelligible]--in India we have a name that I would use in the house.
0:34 0:34 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:25 0:34 MALE:  And then, when you go to school, you need a real formal kind of a name.  So they're like in a hurry, and my mom was reading this book.  And she was reading about this character, and she was like, let's give him this name.
0:44 0:49 FEMALE:  You know, I read about that for the first time in this book by nameX--I'm going to butcher this author's name.
0:41 0:42 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:51 0:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And I was--she had a short story from her latest book that came out; it was in nameX's.  And it was about this kid who's name was Gogal [phonetic] and it like--
0:50 0:52 MALE:  The Namesake [unintelligible].
1:01 1:02 FEMALE:  Oh, did you read that?
0:53 0:57 MALE:  I read parts of it, yeah.  I love her.   She has another short story collection before this--
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:57 0:59 MALE:  That she got the Pulitzer Prize for.
1:09 1:09 FEMALE:  Oh.  Was it good?
1:01 1:03 MALE:  It's brilliant.  Really good.  She writes really well.
1:12 1:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.  No, she's an amazing writer.  She's an amazing, amazing writer.  I mean, who could make a story out of Gogal?  I mean, but it was just--it was fantastic.
1:10 1:10 MALE:  Yeah.
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  So.
1:11 1:13 MALE:  Yeah, she made--yeah, that's interesting.
1:22 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So I did--I've heard about that phenomenon before, the pet name and then the--
1:16 1:16 MALE:  Right.  Right.
1:26 1:26 FEMALE:  --formal name.
1:17 1:18 MALE:  Exactly.  Exactly.
1:27 1:32 FEMALE:  Otherwise, I would have been like, what?  Yeah.  So what do you do here at Stanford?
1:24 1:26 MALE:  Uh, I'm a third year PhD student in the School of Education.
1:36 1:38 FEMALE:  Oh.  You're in ED School.  What exactly do you do in the ED School?
1:29 1:34 MALE:  I do something which is not at all related to education.  I actually look at how technology used within organizations.
1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  Wait.  How technology is used with--
1:36 1:37 MALE:  Used within organizations.
1:47 1:47 FEMALE:  Oh.
1:39 1:51 MALE:  Different--yeah, how do coworkers use technology for learning and knowledge sharing, especially when they work with people who are the--at not at the same space--geographic place that they are, across the [unintelligible].
2:00 2:05 FEMALE:  Um, and did you know that what you were going to be doing had nothing to do with education when you entered the program? Or--
1:56 1:59 MALE:  Yeah, because I'm in the program they call learning sciences and technology design.
2:08 2:09 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
1:59 2:06 MALE:  So it's pretty focused on that.  [unintelligible] very different.  I came in just because of that program and the people who are in that program.
2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  I see.
2:07 2:09 MALE:  And other people at Stanford who do the same kind of research.
2:20 2:20 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
2:11 2:11 MALE:  What department are you in?
2:21 2:25 FEMALE:  I'm in law school. I'm just right next door.  Just next door.  I'm in first year.
2:16 2:19 MALE:  First year law school?  So what is the law program like here, overall?
2:30 2:49 FEMALE:  Um, relaxed, laid back, fun, for the most part.  I feel like I'm in junior high, but that's okay.  Um, it's really quite interesting how I first rushed back.  I mean, I think that a lot of the law students--I mean, I took some time off before I went to law school.  But I think a lot of--like half of them are straight out, like 21, 22.
2:40 2:40 MALE:  Really?
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:41 2:41 MALE:  Wow.
2:51 3:01 FEMALE:  Really young.  And then, you've got a, like an odd group that's older.  And then, I think a lot of the younger kids have worked so hard as undergraduates, that they've never had a chance to cut loose and have fun.
2:53 2:53 MALE:  Okay.
3:02 3:06 FEMALE:  Like they've never had the college experience that people have in college, 'cause they're all overachieving, type A persons.
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:07 3:24 FEMALE:  And so, they're sort of doing it now.  So I mean, you would think by the time you're 22, you'd know how much you can drink, right?  I can't tell you how many parties I've been to where people were puking all over the place.  They can't walk.  You know, so.
3:15 3:19 MALE:  That's interesting, yeah.  Our school, yeah, it's like, the average age used to be 35 years for the PHD program.
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:20 3:27 MALE:  It's kind of coming down.  Some people are really young who are in the program, and some people aren't.  There's a lot of age variance in our school too, for the PhD.
3:37 3:52 FEMALE:  I think a part of it is that the economy hasn't been good in the U.S.  And so, whereas college graduates might have decided to work for a few years, and then, maybe they go back, a lot of people, I think, just straight out are like, I don't want to go and get a job.  They can't find jobs; they go straight to graduate school.  What do you think it is?
3:44 3:48 MALE:  That might be, that might be a partial reason.  I think it's just that--
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  Oh.
3:52 4:04 MALE:  In our school, more and more people are coming just for the research part, and they're not trying to go into like teaching and stuff after this.  So that has kind of changed the curriculum a little bit.
4:14 4:14 FEMALE:  I see.
4:05 4:08 MALE:  And they're coming with less teaching experience, just for the research part.
