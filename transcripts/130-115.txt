0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  How are you? 
0:03 0:07 MALE:  Hi, I'm male115.  Hi, nice to meet you.  
0:05 0:05 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] .  
0:08 0:11 MALE:  I'm from Spain.  How about you?  
0:11 0:11 FEMALE:  I'm from Europe.  
0:14 0:26 MALE:  You're from Europe?  I am--well, I will tell you in a second once I hear your accent.  So, what was your letter, "J?"  I will tell you in a second.  So, what's your program?  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Philosophy.  
0:28 0:29 MALE:  Oh, philosophy.  
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  What is yours?  
0:31 0:31 MALE:  I do physics.  
0:29 0:31 FEMALE:  What kind of physics?  
0:35 0:37 MALE:  I do biophysics, computational stuff.  
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  Like what?  
0:41 0:53 MALE:  I--okay, so I work with computers on proteins.  That's what I do.  Instead of doing experiments, it's in the computer. I'm sorry?  
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  What did you figure out until now?  
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Oh, by my research?  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:57 1:04 MALE:  Oh, that they are very important.  [laughter]  I cannot guess where you are from.  Let me say Bulgaria.  
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  Where?  
1:06 1:06 MALE:  Bulgaria?  
1:05 1:09 FEMALE:  Bulgaria, why?  Accent, or?  
1:13 1:13 MALE: No, French.  
1:13 1:13 FEMALE:  French?  
1:15 1:16 MALE:  Are you French?  
1:14 1:15 FEMALE:  Do you know French?  Do you speak French? 
1:17 1:17 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:16 1:19 FEMALE:  So you should recognize if I have a French accent, right?  
1:21 1:22 MALE:  Well, from Belgium?  
1:21 1:23 FEMALE: That would be a French accent too.  
1:25 1:28 MALE:  Yeah, but in Belgium they also speak the other [unintelligible].  
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  Ah yes, the other one.  
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Or Dutch?  
1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  It's getting interesting.  
1:32 1:34 MALE:  Or Denmark?  Denmark?  
1:32 1:35 FEMALE:  Ah, am I not too brown for Denmark, like too dark?  
1:40 1:45 MALE:  I don't know.  You're mostly--I know--are you Swedish?  
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  You are getting to the north, and I am from the south.  
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Oh, Greece?  
1:50 1:51 FEMALE:  I [unintelligible], but I'm from Romania.  
1:53 1:55 MALE:  Oh, Romania, Romania.  
1:52 1:56 FEMALE:  My father is Greek, but I was born in Romania.  
1:58 2:03 MALE:  Oh, that's really interesting. Okay, okay, okay, that was hard.  
2:00 2:06 FEMALE:  So, I speak a romance language.  I think it's really important for a country.  
2:08 2:12 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that's where I see a little bit of French, but you don't have a French accent.  
2:13 2:15 FEMALE:  At least I wasn't Russian.  Why Bulgarian?  
2:20 2:29 MALE:  Because I don't know many people from Bulgaria, and then I said probably she is from Bulgaria.  I know.  That was a very wild guess.  
2:28 2:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:36 2:48 MALE:  You know what happens that people--I mean at least me, we don't know so much about accents, you know, and then we just have these silly ideas that maybe within a Russian accent it sounds like that.  
2:46 2:46 FEMALE: Oh.
2:49 2:55 MALE: And to me people very often they say that I come from Russia.  Really?  
2:53 2:55 FEMALE:  They tell you that?  
2:56 2:58 MALE:  They tell me that, I don't know why [unintelligible].  
2:56 3:00 FEMALE:  Because you are speaking a [unintelligible] language, and [unintelligible] romance.  
3:03 3:10 MALE:  I know but many people they just--since I'm pretty pale, and my name is male115 and that sounds like Serge [phonetic].  
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  Ah, [unintelligible].  
3:12 3:19 MALE:  I guess it's regards of that, but many people say, oh, you come from Russia?  Yeah, really I'm the next [unintelligible].  
3:17 3:19 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
3:21 3:26 MALE:  In the beginning I was surprised, but then I say I come from Spain.  And then for some reason they like it better.  
3:25 3:25 FEMALE: Of course. 
3:28 3:29 MALE:  They say, oh, really?  They don't believe me sometimes.  
3:28 3:30 FEMALE:  They feel happy then, right?  
3:33 3:43 MALE:  Yeah, and they say, oh, you speak Spanish.  And I say, yeah, I'm telling you I come from Spain.  They don't really believe me.  They think I was born in Spain, and then I moved somewhere else.  Really funny.  
3:41 3:42 FEMALE: Where do you come from?  
3:45 3:46 MALE:  From?  I am from Madrid.  
3:44 3:45 FEMALE:  Where?  
3:47 3:48 MALE:  I am from Madrid.  
3:47 3:53 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  I always wanted to visit Spain.  That's my next spot.
3:56 3:57 MALE:  Oh really?  You have to go.  
3:56 3:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, many people know about Spain. 
4:00 4:02 MALE:  Okay, very nice to meet you.
