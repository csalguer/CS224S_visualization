0:10 0:10 MALE:  I am.
0:10 0:13 FEMALE:  Where from?
0:13 0:13 MALE:  New Delhi.
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  I just went to New Delhi over Christmas.
0:14 0:14 MALE:  Wow.
0:15 0:16 FEMALE:  I had a friend getting married there.
0:16 0:17 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:17 0:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, and I spent two weeks [unintelligible].
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Wow.
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.  
0:22 0:22 MALE:  I think that's more then I've been there.
0:22 0:24 FEMALE:  I know.
0:24 0:26 MALE:   [unintelligible].
0:27 0:27 FEMALE: What?
0:27 0:30 MALE:  I know your stay was [unintelligible]-
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  No, no, no, uh -
0:31 0:31 MALE:  Wasn't very pleasant.
0:31 0:56 FEMALE:  No, I mean it was -- no, it was pretty.  No, but I'll actually give you an honest answer.  Contrast, just like I'm sure you heard from everyone, I had a really amazing experience as my driver, who I met in New Delhi and stayed with us for six days most amazing man ever, just blown away with how honest he was because a lot of people were trying to rip us off, obviously.
0:56 0:56 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:57 1:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, he was taking care of me like a family member.  Just so touched.
1:03 1:03 MALE:  That was lucky.
1:04 1:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, I was really touched.  I mean, just the sweetest, nicest person.  But I did have my luggage stolen, uh.
1:11 1:11 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:12 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, but then it was stolen at a train station and was locked up, but then it was found.  I don't know how, you know, I don't know what was going on.  But we called the police, there like 15 people running around, everything, we were having this huge search party, so maybe they just got scared away and they put it back.  I don't know what happened, but I ended up getting it back, thankfully.
1:33 1:34 MALE:  Oh, okay.
1:34 1:41 FEMALE:  Yeah, and I ended up getting food poisoning, but aside from those two incidents.
1:41 1:42 MALE:  But at least you got it back, right?
1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.  Uh-mm.
1:43 1:48 MALE:  I'm surprised.  I mean usually when something gets lost, even lost [unintelligible] you're not getting it back.
1:49 1:58 FEMALE:  I think it was -- it was really weird.  I think that they actually -- like one of the security guards took it -
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Everything's [unintelligible].
1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  I know.
1:58 2:03 MALE:  [unintelligible] all sorts of people, all ranges and everything.
2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:04 2:07 MALE:  Food poisoning, you know, one can expect that.
2:07 2:13 FEMALE: That was expected.  So, but it was -- it was definitely interesting.  'Cause we took an overnight train -
2:13 2:14 MALE:  Uh-mm.
2:14 2:17 FEMALE:  Um, to Jazomark [phonetic].
2:17 2:17 MALE:  Uh-mm.
2:18 2:31 FEMALE:  And that's like impossible to get to.  Right?  It's like all the way out by the border.  So end up getting sick on the train, end up having to spend a couple of hours in the train station.  There was homeless people, and me.  
2:31 2:31 MALE:  Wow.
2:32 2:35 FEMALE:  [laughter].  It was a little rough.
2:35 2:39 MALE:  [unintelligible] and having food poisoning [unintelligible].
