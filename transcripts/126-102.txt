00:02  	00:02  	FEMALE:  Break.  Hi.

00:02  	00:03  	MALE:  My gosh.

00:04  	00:07  	FEMALE:  Hi.  It feels like they're cutting down the time a little by little [laughter].

00:07  	00:11  	MALE:  [laughter] well, I wasn't finishing to begin with, so.  

00:12  	00:13  	FEMALE:  I try not to distract you.

00:14  	00:16  	MALE:  Oh, that's all right. I'll finish it later.

00:16  	00:18  	FEMALE:  So where did you grow up?

00:18  	00:23  	MALE:  Uh, I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio.  I'm very much a Midwestern person and uh --

00:23  	00:29  	FEMALE:  And when you say a Midwestern person what do you mean by that?  Just cause I don't want to impose stereotype to Midwestern.

00:30  	00:56  	MALE:  Probably, fits your stereotype.  I don't know it depends on what your stereotypes are.  My uh, it's sort of mellow, but friendly, not overly direct about things.  Um, uh, I'm trying to think.  Not perhaps as politically or culturally diverse as the coast respectively.

00:56  	00:59  	FEMALE:  So apparently it's very important politically, I've learned.  

00:59  	01:07  	MALE:  Oh, absolutely, no it's been great.  In fact I kept my residency in Ohio until recently, just to vote in this last election, so.

01:07 	01:14  	FEMALE:  Just so you could your grandkids that my vote doesn't matter, you can say my vote matters [laughter].

01:13  	01:14  	MALE:  My vote mattes [laughter].  Yep.

01:15  	01:20  	FEMALE:  Unfortunately, my legal residence is California so my vote does not matter.  

01:20  	01:26  	MALE:  Yeah, well California is important state, fortunately it wasn't sequestered so, that's good.

01:26  	01:39  	FEMALE:  And I have the unfortunate luck of -- having only ever voted absentee?  See I don't think my -- my absentee ballots I don't think have ever arrived on time.  So I have never in fact voted.  Because [unintelligible] in time.

01:40  	01:41  	MALE:  Wow, interesting.

01:42  	01:43  	FEMALE:  I'm not excited -- 

01:43  	01:45  	MALE:   You don't like going to the polls and have that commodore or?

01:46  	01:51  	FEMALE:  Absentee is cool.  Okay, for four years I was absentee out of state.

01:51  	01:53  	MALE:  Okay.  So this is when you were undergrad?

01:53  	01:53  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

01:53  	01:54  	MALE:  Where was?

01:54  	01:55  	FEMALE:  I was in Virginia.

01:55  	01:57  	MALE:  Cool.  At the University of Virginia or?

01:57  	02:01  	FEMALE:  No, the University.

02:01  	02:02  	MALE:  How did you like it there?

02:02  	02:06  	FEMALE:  I loved it.  It was so hard to leave.

02:06  	02:06  	MALE:  What did you study?

02:07  	02:07  	FEMALE:  Electrical Engineering.

02:07 	02:09  	MALE:  Oh really?  Are you in the Engineering Program here then?

02:09  	02:10  	FEMALE:  Um-hum.

02:11  	02:12  	MALE:  Also doing electrical?

02:13  	02:25  	FEMALE:  At the moment I know you can switch, undergrad to grad.  I don't see -- I am amazed at all the electrical engineers that I meet here that did study this as an undergrad, because I'm struggling so much.  I'm just amazed that they can keep it.

02:26  	02:51  	MALE:  I know.  Particularly when I was in Illinois I did my undergrad in engineering as well.  And I did it -- I started out in computer engineering and then I switched to uh, industrial engineering and I switched to general engineering which was sort of an interdisciplinary sort of a little bit more of business engineering, but more closer to mechanical and uh ended up double majoring in philosophy there.  And that's how I got into philosophy education, which is what I do now basically.

02:52  	02:54  	FEMALE:  So you in the Education school?

02:55  	03:05  	MALE:  I'm in the School of Education, believe it or not doing philosophy of education, so.  A little bit different than engineering.  But I do philosophy of education research, so I'm interested in philosophy science, if there's such a thing.

03:05  	03:16  	FEMALE:  I've worked with some interesting people [unintelligible].  My grandmother was a professor and she --.  She actually didn't get her PhD until she was 55 or something like that. 

03:16  	03:17  	MALE:  What did she do it in?  Or is she a professor of? 

03:17  	04:00  	FEMALE:  Mathematics.  

04:00	04:00	MALE:  Mathematics.

04:01	04:03	FEMALE: And so she went and started teaching at age 60 or something like that.  And she -- when her kids moved out of the house to go to college, she wanted a little more company, because my grandfather worked long hours.  So started reading dog training books and learned that dogs learn better under fear.  So if you yell at the dog and say, don't eat the bunny.  The dog will less likely to [unintelligible] than if you said, nice puppy don't eat the bunny.  So she decided this also applied to college students.

04:03	04:03	MALE:  Nice

04:03	04:06	FEMALE:  So, I have met students that my grandmother taught and most of them say, you're [unintelligible] granddaughter? 

04:07  	04:11  	MALE:  You're so friendly and nice [laughter].  

04:08	04:11	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] and they go oh, did you like her?  Very good teacher [unintelligible] [horn] any of that.  I'm sure you don't tell people their mean.

04:11	04:12	MALE:  No that' snot the educational -- the [unintelligible] that we recommend.  But it was very nice meeting you female126.

04:12  	04:13  	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
