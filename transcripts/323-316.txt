0:00 0:01 FEMALE: [laughter] That's right.
0:02 0:04 MALE: I need to pick up my speed. So I'm male316 by the way.
0:04 0:04 FEMALE: Hi, I'm female323.
0:06 0:08 MALE: Nice to meet you. So you're the one that recruited nameX there?
0:07 0:08 FEMALE: I did, yeah.	
0:09 0:17 MALE: I heard all about you. Yeah. The trouble maker that you are. So what? Is this Station C?
0:13 0:22 FEMALE: C, yeah. nameX and I teach together, we're together all the time so.
0:24 0:26 MALE: So you're in the School of Education as well, obviously.
0:25 0:25 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.
0:26 0:34  MALE: She really didn't tell me anything about you. She was just said that the person you'll meet next, that's the one that dragged me down here. So I'm used to it or did she drag you down here, right?
0:33 0:36 FEMALE: No, it's me. I'm guilty. I did the dragging.
0:38 0:42 MALE: That's good. So you're almost done with the education thing?
0:40 0:42 FEMALE: Yeah. I'll be done June 12th, it's really exciting.
0:44 0:47 MALE: Are you really excited about it or are you kind of...?
0:45 0:51 FEMALE: No. I'm excited that I'm-- I love going to school here but I'm also excited that it's gone and done.
0:52 0:52 MALE: So what are you going to do now?
0:53 0:57 FEMALE: I have the summer off and then I'm teaching full time in San Lorenzo High School next year.
0:59 1:01 MALE: Where's San Lorenzo High School?
1:00 1:04 FEMALE: If you take 92 to 880, go up two exits, it's pretty much right there.
1:06 1:07 MALE: Wow.
1:06 1:08 FEMALE: Yeah. Sort of in the middle of nowhere. 
1:10 1:11 MALE: Awesome. So are you going to live over there.
1:11 1:13 FEMALE: Not there, no. I'm going to live in San Francisco.
1:15 1:17 MALE: That's kind of a commute, isn't it?
1:15 1:16 FEMALE: Yeah, it is.	
1:20 1:21 MALE: So what subject are you teaching?
1:19 1:19 FEMALE: Math.	
1:22 1:22 MALE: Oh. You're both math teachers.
1:20 1:23 FEMALE: Yeah. We literally teach in the same classroom right now.
1:24 1:26 MALE: Yeah. Is that what started the connection? Is it like the love for math?
1:27 1:37 FEMALE: Yeah. It just happened that we ended up spending a whole bunch of time together. And then now that we had a teacher on maternity leave so we took over her classes.
1:37 1:39 MALE: That's awesome.
1:38 1:41 FEMALE: So we teach the same classroom with the same students.
1:41 1:44 MALE: So you guys during the Masters program do you guys do like student teaching?
1:44 1:45 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:46 1:47 MALE: But you don't do any--
1:45 1:46 FEMALE: You're supposed to do student teaching the whole year.
1:47 1:49 MALE: An4d you did not or you did?
1:49 1:53 FEMALE: We did but we're not student teaching anymore, we're the actual teacher. So we're getting paid, which is nice.
1:53 1:54 MALE: Oh yeah?
1:54 1:54 FEMALE: Yeah.	
1:56 1:56 MALE: So it's not even like an informal.
1:56 2:02 FEMALE: No, no, no, no. It's like we're officially interns at the district, which is nice because most people student teach for free so.
2:03 2:04 MALE: What school district?
2:04 2:07 FEMALE: San Mateo. It's Hillsdale High School. Did you grow up around here?
2:08 2:12 MALE: No. But I lived in San Francisco for a while actually before coming back to school.
2:10 2:13 FEMALE: And what are you doing at Stanford?
2:14 2:20  MALE: Goofing off basically. [laughter] No. I'm in the Business School so basically goofing off.
2:19 2:20 FEMALE: Really?
2:21 2:23 MALE: No, no, no. We do a little bit of work.
2:24 2:24 FEMALE: Monday through Wednesday? 
2:28 2:37 MALE: I'm actually taking a test as we speak. It's a take home test so it started, came to this little dating event and I have to go back home and finish it. It's like legitimate somewhat.
2:34 2:38 FEMALE: Okay. Are you first or second year?
2:39 2:41 MALE: First year. As opposed to second year, it's harder.
2:40 2:41 FEMALE: Better? Harder?
2:41 2:41 MALE: Yeah, easier.
2:44 2:44 FEMALE: [laughter]
2:46 2:51 MALE: Harder like on your body, on your life but easier, I guess [unintelligible].
2:51 2:52 FEMALE: Interesting. What did you do before you came to business school?
2:53 3:04 MALE: I worked in San Francisco for this economic consulting firm so guys with PhDs in economics. Which is boring stuff on a day to day basis, very long hours.
3:03 3:04 FEMALE: Office Space stuff?
3:06 3:07 MALE: Exactly. I even had a red stapler.
3:07 3:07 FEMALE: Did you? [laughter]
3:09 3:13 MALE: It was awesome. So what about you? Did you come directly out of undergrad?
3:12 3:20 FEMALE: No. I worked for a couple months for Lucent Technologies and then I worked for Arista Records in New York City for a little over two years.
3:18 3:22 MALE: Oh yeah? Oh wow.
3:22 3:22 FEMALE: That was fun.
3:23 3:23 MALE: What did you do for them?
3:24 3:40 FEMALE: I was the international marketing coordinator, which means that I booked travel. Basically when we had an artist, like Usher went internationally for a promotional tour I managed all of the travel and their visa and their budget. It was interesting.
3:41 3:43 MALE: So what caused you to switch gears?
3:43 4:00 FEMALE: Well Arista was having financial problems so I didn't really think they were going to hang around for a while. And I wanted to try teaching, do something a little bit more meaningful. Getting Puff Daddy's entourage visas to go to France is not overly fulfilling.
4:02 4:03 MALE: But this is.
4:03 4:05 FEMALE: Yeah, this is completely revolutionizing. [laughter]
4:07 4:08 MALE: All right. Well it was very nice to meet you.	
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: Very nice to meet you, too.
