0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:01 0:02 MALE:  Hey female123.  I'm male117.
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:02 0:03 MALE:  How's it going?
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  Good.  Good.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  You get to be in the prime spot here, huh?
0:14 0:18 FEMALE:  Not really [laughter].  I mean, I'm close to the Hershey's kisses, which if you'd like one, you're more than--
0:12 0:12 MALE:  Oh yeah.  That's--
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  You know, there's caramel in these?
0:14 0:14 MALE:  No
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  Did you know--
0:16 0:16 MALE:  And you know, I've never had these ones.
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  I had no idea they make caramel now.
0:19 0:24 MALE:  You know what's going to happen now?  I'm going to be going to the store and getting these things all the time [laughter].
0:30 0:34 FEMALE:  Marketing.  Actually, this is run by Hershey Corporation, um [laughter].
0:29 0:29 MALE:  Yeah.
0:35 0:38 FEMALE:  It's not really a research program.  Yeah.
0:32 0:33 MALE:  Well I have no problem with that, but [laughter].
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:34 0:34 MALE:  How's it going?
0:41 0:44 FEMALE:  Good.  Really good.  Yeah, you are--can I guess what department you're in?
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Yes.
0:45 0:47 FEMALE:  I'm going to guess political science.
0:42 0:43 MALE:  No, but I was in political science as an undergrad.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE:  Oh were you?
0:44 0:44 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:51 0:51 FEMALE:  What program are you in?
0:46 0:46 MALE:  I was history, political science--I'm in law. Law school.
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  You are not a law student.
0:49 0:49 MALE:  Yeah.
0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  How come I haven't seen you?
0:51 0:52 MALE:  Are you a law student?
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:52 0:52 MALE:  What year are you?
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  I'm a one L.  What year are you?
0:54 0:54 MALE:  Three L.
1:03 1:12 FEMALE:  'Cause you know, the other thing--well I was thinking you--I thought you might be a B-school person, but you weren't quite B-school, which was why I guessed political science.
1:06 1:06 MALE:  How'd you, uh--
1:13 1:17 FEMALE:  But I would have guessed law, except I didn't see you in law school.  That's why I went to political science.
1:11 1:15 MALE:  So how did you, um, put me in that?  How did you think I'd be a--
1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  I don't know.
1:16 1:16 MALE:  What made--what was it?
1:23 1:28 FEMALE:  I mean, don't you think there's sort of like a B-school type, political science type, law school type?  No?
1:23 1:24 MALE:  I'm not sure.  Well what would a--
1:31 1:33 FEMALE:  I got myself in trouble.
1:27 1:28 MALE:  [laughter] You did [unintelligible] big [laughter].
1:37 1:46 FEMALE:  I don't know.  You're just more--um, how do I want to put this?  I think people in the professional schools tend to be a little bit more professional.
1:42 1:47 MALE:  You know, it's funny, though, is 'cause I was like--um, this dress you mean?  Like professional dress or?
1:53 2:07 FEMALE:  But also the mannerisms and sort of the way you carry yourself, too, is, you know, not one of, like, the people in the [unintelligible] program.  Which is why I thought well, the most [unintelligible] program is political science [laughter].
2:02 2:03 MALE:  Well that was nice of you--nice way to view that.
2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  I just got myself in lots of trouble, didn't I?
2:06 2:10 MALE:  You just dug yourself out by putting a positive spin on it, so that's good [laughter].
2:16 2:18 FEMALE:  I'm a lawyer.  What can I say [laughter].
2:12 2:14 MALE:  Exactly.  That was good.  I'm impressed.
2:19 2:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, thanks.  So why haven't I seen you--is it just 'cause you're a three [unintelligible] and three [unintelligible] don't hang around the law school?
2:17 2:32 MALE:  Well you know, I've actually been out of town so much this semester.  It's just been unbelievable what I've had going on.  So, I actually have to go--Sunday, I have to go to Florida testify at a trial next week.  So this has been like--that's how my semester's been.
2:39 2:39 FEMALE:  Are you an expert witness?
2:34 2:37 MALE:  [unintelligible] expert, no.  That'd be pretty funny, though.
2:43 2:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:37 2:41 MALE:  No.  I'm just a witness to something that happened with people that I know.
2:47 2:49 FEMALE:  Oh I see.  I'm sorry to hear about that.
2:43 2:45 MALE:  Yeah. 
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  Right.  I see.
2:46 2:48 MALE:  It's one of those things that I thought I was going to be able to do by phone.
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
2:49 3:00 MALE:  I actually had to testify a couple times already by phone, and then they said just recently, now you've got to--you have to come.  And so, I'm like, okay.  [unintelligible] just par for the course this semester.  But--so I haven't been around that much.  But.
3:06 3:12 FEMALE:  I see.  I mean, I don't even think I've seen you--I mean, I've sort of poured over the Facebook, as I'm sure everybody has [unintelligible] their 1-0 year.
3:07 3:07 MALE:  Yeah.
3:13 3:15 FEMALE:  I don't think I even remember you from the Facebook.
3:10 3:10 MALE:  I'm not very memorable.  No.
3:17 3:20 FEMALE:  No, no I don't mean it like that.  You must be one of the blank faces with the question mark.
3:15 3:15 MALE:  No.  I'm in there.
3:22 3:24 FEMALE:  Oh so what are you doing afterwards?
3:18 3:20 MALE:  I'm working at a law firm.
3:26 3:26 FEMALE:  Where at?
3:21 3:21 MALE:  In Chicago.
3:28 3:28 FEMALE:  Are you from the Midwest?
3:23 3:23 MALE:  Yeah, I am.
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  Me too.
3:25 3:25 MALE:  Where are you from?
3:31 3:31 FEMALE:  Cleveland.
3:26 3:26 MALE:  Cleveland.  Okay.
3:32 3:33 FEMALE:  How about you?
3:28 3:28 MALE:  I'm from Chicago.
3:35 3:35 FEMALE:  Which firm are you working at?
3:29 3:31 MALE:  At Lebuff [phonetic] Lamb.
3:38 3:40 FEMALE:  Actually they're not [unintelligible] Midwest firm.
3:34 3:37 MALE:  I was actually going to work out here.  I worked at [unintelligible] in Palo Alto this summer.
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:38 3:50 MALE:  And um, I accepted a job there, actually.  And then--so with all this stuff that's been going on, I decided I better go to Chicago 'cause this--I've had all this family stuff going on, where I've had to fly back a lot.  So.
3:57 3:57 FEMALE:  I'm sorry to hear that.
3:51 3:52 MALE:  [laughter] [unintelligible].
3:59 4:01 FEMALE:  It was great talking to you.  Maybe I'll see you around the law school.
3:55 3:58 MALE:  Yeah.  Maybe you'll notice me next time [unintelligible] [laughter].
4:04 4:06 FEMALE:  No, I definitely would have noticed you.
