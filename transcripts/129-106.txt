0:08 0:09 FEMALE:  I'm such a rule follower.  
0:10 0:10 MALE:  Huh?
0:10 0:11 FEMALE:  I'm such a rule follower.  
0:11 0:12 MALE:  Yeah, I know.
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:13 0:20 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].  Nice to meet you.  I have--I screwed up on my numbering so I'm making sure I'm writing the names on each one.  
0:21 0:21 FEMALE:  Right.  
0:21 0:24 MALE:  Cause I'm here just to help research, and I don't want to hurt--
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  Right, me too. 
0:25 0:25 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  I'm in nameX's class.  
0:26 0:27 MALE:  Oh, really?  
0:27 0:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  We were reminded repeatedly that this is for research, [unintelligible] research.  
0:33 0:38 MALE:  Yeah, uh-huh. Is that allowed to be in the class of someone who is organizing this?  You're not going to sway it in any way.  
0:37 0:43 FEMALE:  It's not on my [unintelligible].  He's not here.  Actually a couple of us are like, okay, we'll do it.  
0:44 0:46 MALE:  They're planted.  Girls [unintelligible]?  
0:47 0:52 FEMALE:  You know, I don't think there are any single guys--well, there are [unintelligible] single guys in that class.  But not--
0:52 0:53 MALE:  [interposing]  Okay, all right, uh-huh.  
0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, I didn't even know about it until he mentioned it to us.  
0:55 0:55 MALE:  Oh, really?  
0:55 0:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't know how everybody else found out about it.
0:57 1:03 MALE:  I heard it through a friend of mine.  I hadn't heard until like a few days ago.  
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] to come out?
1:05 1:05 MALE:  Yeah, yeah. 
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  What program are you in?
1:07 1:08 MALE:  I'm in computer science?
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  Computer science?
1:10 1:11 MALE:  Yeah.
1:11 1:12 FEMALE: Master's, Phd?
1:12 1:12 MALE:  Master's.
1:13 1:13 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:13 1:20 MALE: I work in the genetics department on computational biology.  So...
1:20 1:21 FEMALE: That's pretty curious, isn't it?  
1:22 1:24 MALE:  Like, I guess so.  It sounds very impressive, right?  
1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:25 1:27 MALE:  Computational, a couple of big words together.  
1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, throw genetics and all such--
1:30 1:32 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, you're in the ed school?
1:32 1:33 FEMALE:  I'm in the ed school.  
1:34 1:35 MALE:  What kind of--
1:35 1:38 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I'm doing a Master's in policy organization.  
1:38 1:40 MALE:  Uh-huh, cool.  
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  It is cool.  It's fun stuff.  
1:43 1:43 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:43 1:44 FEMALE:  Very interesting.  
1:44 1:47 MALE:  Yeah, what do you plan to do with that?  Do you know?  
1:46 1:48 FEMALE:  That's a good question.
1:48 1:49 MALE:  Yeah, I have no idea.
1:50 1:55 FEMALE:  I'm finally starting to sort of figure it out.  I feel like for the last seven months I'm like, oh, I have no idea what I want to do.  
1:56 1:56 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:57 2:01 FEMALE:  I'm looking at jobs almost exclusively in non-profits that are doing work directly.  
2:01 2:01 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:01 2:04 FEMALE:  With schools and school districts, sort of urban school reform.
2:05 2:05 MALE: Yeah, okay.  
2:06 2:09 FEMALE:  A more external position than [unintelligible].  
2:10 2:13 MALE:  Yeah, I mean that would be stuff in classrooms like--
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I taught second grade for three years.  
2:15 2:17 MALE:  Oh, yeah?  Did you like that?  
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  A great job.  Hard work.  
2:21 2:21 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  But it was great, and I miss it a lot.  
2:23 2:25 MALE:  Uh-huh, was that in this area?
2:26 2:27 FEMALE:  No, it was in Boston actually.  
2:28 2:28 MALE:  Okay.  
2:28 2:29 FEMALE:  Were you here before Stanford?  
2:30 2:32 MALE:  Yeah, I went to Berkley for undergrad.
2:32 2:33 FEMALE:  Uh-oh, switching teams.  
2:34 2:34 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  So now who do you cheer for?
2:35 2:37 MALE:  Well, my plan--I cheer for Berkley still.  
2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  Okay, that's good.  
2:38 2:39 MALE:  I even actually cheer for--
2:39 2:40 FEMALE:  That's good.  The loyalty has to be with the undergrad.  
2:40 2:45 MALE:  I've even been to Stanford games where they're playing like Arizona or something and cheered against Stanford.  
2:45 2:45 FEMALE:  Really?  
2:45 2:45 MALE:  Yeah.
2:46 2:48 FEMALE:  That's kind of intense.  For any particular reason?
2:49 2:58 MALE:  At Berkley we get completely conditioned to hate Stanford.  It's like--here they don't really care about the whole rivalry, but at Berkley it's a very big deal.  
2:58 3:00 FEMALE:  Okay, did you grow up in California?
3:00 3:01 MALE:  No, I grew up in Minnesota actually.  
3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  Minnesota?  
3:03 3:05 MALE:  Yeah, is that surprising?  
3:05 3:09 FEMALE:  Uhm, well yeah just because there aren't that many--
3:10 3:10 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  I mean in the grand scheme of things there aren't that many Minnesotans in there.  
3:11 3:14 MALE:  That's true.  Yeah, I guess it's somewhat surprising.  
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  Minneapolis?  
3:14 3:25 MALE:  Yeah, a suburb of Minneapolis. So, my plan is that if I go into the real world and do well, I'll say I'm from Berkley, but if I do badly, I'll be like I'm from Stanford.  And then--
3:25 3:26 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Man, [unintelligible].
3:27 3:31 MALE:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Either way I win.  I'm happy either way.  
3:31 3:34 FEMALE:  Okay, well that's pretty intense loyalty to the Bay Area.  
3:35 3:39 MALE:  Yeah, I guess so.  I like it a lot better than the Midwest I have to say.  
3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
3:39 3:40 MALE:  Are you from Boston?  
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  No, I grew up in Texas.
3:41 3:42 MALE: Oh, really?  
3:43 4:08 FEMALE:  It's like embarrassing to say.  [laughter]  People have been [unintelligible].  I don't know what it is every [unintelligible] I've been in class or something has come up about Texas that is completely embarrassing.  And there are such stereotypes, but they're totally true.  And I don't know what's been going on the last couple of weeks, but repeatedly I've had like ten turning and ribbing me, like pointing at me and laughing.  I know, it's embarrassing.  
4:09 4:09 MALE: Oh.
4:10 4:11 FEMALE: Well, it was nice to meet you.  Have fun tonight.  
4:11 4:12 MALE:  Nice to meet you too.  You too.  
4:12 4:12 FEMALE:  Bye.  
4:13 4:13 MALE:  Have a good time.
