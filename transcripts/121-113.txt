0:06 0:07 FEMALE: [laughter] Hi, I'm female121.

0:07 0:08 MALE: Huh?  nameX.

0:07 0:08 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

0:09 0:09 MALE: Good to meet you.

0:09 0:10 FEMALE: Are you having fun?

0:10 0:16 MALE: Yeah, yeah, totally.  I've never done anything like this.  My friend actually convinced me and he pulled me into it basically.

0:16 0:17 FEMALE: Oh really?

0:17 0:18 MALE: He saw that flyer on his door

0:18 0:19 FEMALE: Uh huh, is he here too?

0:20 0:24 MALE: He was--he's late or I don't know if he came here or not.  He was like the one person holding us up.

0:23 0:26 FEMALE: See, that's not--that's not fair. [laughter] 

0:25 0:28 MALE: Yeah, I feel like I've been abandoned.  Horrible.

0:28 0:31 FEMALE: He set you up.  Maybe he was intending not to come.

0:32 0:34 MALE: Well I don't know.  He just broke up with his girlfriend.

0:34 0:34 FEMALE: Aww.

0:35 0:41 MALE: It was like three weeks ago and then he's all yeah, let's try this thing.  We can compare notes later and laugh about it. 

0:41 0:41 FEMALE: Exactly.

0:41 0:44 MALE: And I was like skeptical, like dude, I don't want to do this.  

0:44 0:45 FEMALE: It sounds strange doesn't it?

0:44 0:47 MALE: And then like, yeah, then I get pulled into it and I'm like oh, might as well.

0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Yeah, it's not bad actually.

0:49 0:50 MALE: Yeah, yeah.

0:50 0:57 FEMALE: It's not bad.  It's not-I had no idea what to expect and I was trying to get information out of nameX [phonetic] beforehand and she's like I don't know.

0:56 0:58 MALE: Oh really?  Did you know her or--?

0:58 0:59 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm in the ed school so--

0:59 1:00 MALE: Oh, okay, okay.

1:00 1:07 FEMALE: --I have um, Professor nameX for a class right now.  That's how we heard about it because he handed out the forms in class.  [laughter]  What program are you in?

1:08 1:09 MALE: I'm an electrical engineer.

1:09 1:10 FEMALE: Excellent.  Excellent.

1:10 1:14 MALE: So working on a PhD, trying to get out of here and get into the real world.

1:15 1:17 FEMALE: Excellent.  How many years are you into it?

1:17 1:18 MALE: Uh, I'm on year five.

1:18 1:21 FEMALE: Oh my God.  And how many more?  Aren't you almost done?

1:22 1:23 MALE: Maybe six total so--

1:23 1:27 FEMALE: Really?  Really?  And then do you want to teach or go get a job or--

1:26 1:32 MALE: Um, I want to get a job in industry.  I want to get away from the university environment for a while just to try something different.  

1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Uh huh.

1:32 1:34 MALE: Because I've been at school for so long.

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: A long time, right, right.

1:35 1:38 MALE: Yeah.  And it's like, a lot of exciting things happening in industry too.

1:38 1:44 FEMALE: Uh huh.  What kind of place?  I don't really know much about electrical engineering, like what kind of companies you could end up at.

1:44 1:47 MALE: If I could get a job at Intel that would be cool.

1:45 1:49 FEMALE: Or your dream.  Like, what's the dream job?  Intel?

1:48 1:56 MALE: That would be cool.  Yeah, well we do laser and optics in our group and that's my research.  And Intel, they're starting an optics division, um--

1:56 2:00 FEMALE: Perfect.  They need you.  [laughter] 

1:58 1:59 MALE: That's the hope.  

2:01 2:01 FEMALE: Send a letter.

2:01 2:03 MALE: We'll see if they're hiring and--

2:03 2:08 FEMALE: Um, do the Stanford professors have connections there?  Like, is that a resource that you can--?

2:08 2:10 MALE: Um, yeah, oh definitely, yes, yes.

2:10 2:12 FEMALE: Good, good.  That's part of the reason to come right?

2:15 2:18 MALE: Yeah, it's all about making the connections.

2:14 2:24 FEMALE: It totally is.  It totally is.  I know I graduate in June and I'm looking for a job right now.  Uh huh.  Because it's only a one year masters program and I've just been hitting them all, you know, like it's time to--

2:25 2:27 MALE: Is that the STEP program or is that kind of different?

2:26 2:39 FEMALE: The STEP program is one of the education programs that prepares you to be a teacher but I'm doing a masters in policy and leadership studies so it's more like I'd work for the district or I would work for an organization that supports schools.

2:39 2:39 MALE: Okay.

2:39 2:43 FEMALE: So it's not the classroom side, it's sort of the other side of the--uh huh.  So--

2:41 2:44 MALE: Okay, oh that's cool, yeah.

2:44 2:54 FEMALE: I know I hope it's cool.  [laughter]  I have to get a job.  Um, so what do you do for fun when you're not doing lasers and optics?

2:53 2:55 MALE: I do Tae Kwon Do at Stanford.

2:55 2:55 FEMALE: No way.

2:56 3:09 MALE: Um, I'm actually pretty involved with the club.  It's a pretty big club, like over a hundred people in it and it's exciting because of the programs and change.  We're trying to set up like a league, and inter-collegiate league.  Make it almost--like model it after like say wrestling, kind of like a varsity sport.

3:09 3:14 FEMALE: Are there other um, colleges or universities that have programs that are sort of already in place?

3:14 3:15 MALE: Berkeley has a huge program.

3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Really?

3:15 3:17 MALE: Yeah, they're very strong.

3:18 3:23 FEMALE: Excellent.  So who--how do you even start that process for making it sort of to be recognized?

3:23 3:31 MALE: Um our coach--  Oh well, our coach has ties with the athletic department and I'm not sure exactly what the goings on are.

3:31 3:31 FEMALE: Mm hmm. 

3:31 3:37 MALE: But like, we have organized events.  We had something called the Big Kick because like, you know, our first league.

3:37 3:38 FEMALE: The big game?  Uh huh.

3:38 3:42 MALE: So like yeah it's a lot of fun.  We just had collegiate nationals last week.

3:43 3:43 FEMALE: Where were they?

3:44 3:44 MALE: They were in Berkeley.

3:45 3:45 FEMALE: Oh they were?

3:45 3:47 MALE: Yeah, that's why--that why it was a big--

3:46 3:47 FEMALE: How'd we do?  How'd you do?

3:48 3:51 MALE: Um, I had a second round.  It's a single elimination tournament.

3:51 3:52 FEMALE: Oh that's tough.

3:53 3:53  MALE: Yeah.

3:53 3:53 FEMALE: That's tough.

3:53 3:56 MALE: So like some awesome kid from Miami just cleaned me up and--

3:57 3:59 FEMALE: The ringer.  [laughter] 

3:58 4:03 MALE: Yeah, well--yeah I knew he was good before, you know.

4:02 4:04 FEMALE: Uh huh.  Excellent.

4:04 4:05 MALE: It was fun just to be there.

4:05 4:12 FEMALE: Absolutely.  And be a part of it, especially if it's going to turn into something.  Like, that's really exciting to be a part of the building process.

4:11 4:13 MALE: Oh yeah, I'm looking forward totally.

4:13 4:14 FEMALE: Excellent, nice meeting you.

4:14 4:14 MALE: It's good meeting you.
