FILE NAME: Male Speaker 109 -- Female Speaker 135

0:03 0:03 MALE:  Hi.  
0:02 0:02 FEMALE: Hi. 
0:04 0:04 MALE:  Are you female135?  
0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:05 0:05 MALE: Hi, I'm male109.  
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  It's nice to meet you.  
0:06 0:08 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  So, what school are you in?  
0:03 0:07 FEMALE:  I'm in education.  
0:10 0:13 MALE:  Oh, education, which part of you education people?  
0:11 0:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, there are a bunch of them.  I'm a doctoral. 
0:17 0:17 MALE:  Oh, I see.  
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:18 0:19 MALE:  Some MS.  
0:17 0:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, a lot of Master's do those.  They sort of outnumber us.  
0:24 0:24 MALE:  Oh, really?  
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:26 0:28 MALE:  So, what's your research topic?  
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  It's college teaching.  
0:30 0:31 MALE:  College teaching.  
0:29 0:39 FEMALE:  So, like I research on different ways, you know, to teach undergraduates and what's the most effective way to, you know, through different fields through teaching.  
0:41 0:46 MALE:  So, what's one of the most effective ways to teach?  
0:44 0:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Like not lecture.  
0:49 0:50 MALE:  Not lecture.  
0:48 0:50 FEMALE:  People [unintelligible].  
0:52 0:55 MALE:  People sleep over lectures.  
0:53 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know, it's a tradition.  What do you study?  
1:01 1:02 MALE:  I studied the school of engineering.  
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:03 1:12 MALE:  I'm a second-year MS in electrical engineering.  So, it's not lecture, and what's a good way to teach.  
1:11 1:32 FEMALE: Well, like a small group project, and in engineering you might do this quite a bit where you have to work as a team and, you know, you have to apply what you know in a real context instead of just like learning theories.  Because they say, you know, the best things are well it really--you can see how to apply it and be there.  
1:35 1:39 MALE:  So, projects, but they still must have a lecture component, or?  
1:37 1:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, lecture, okay, but like lectures for 90 minutes are just kind of a waste of time for the 60--you know, for the first half-hour okay.  
1:49 1:52 MALE:  The statistic by 3 p.m. they are not paying attention to anything.  
1:50 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, and it's really hard to make like a lot of meaning and stay invested when you're getting no, you know, feedback.  So.  
2:03 2:03 MALE:  Interesting.  
2:02 2:04 FEMALE:  Do you think that's true like in your own experience?  
2:07 2:15 MALE:  I don't know.  In the course of my study a lot of the things that the professor taught was just really nothing [unintelligible].  
2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.
2:15 2:27 MALE:  So, I feel that the most things that I learn--I mean that I learn in the science [unintelligible] are just, are just on my own.  
2:25 2:25 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:29 2:35 MALE: Except the intuition that the professors give because sometimes you can use some intuition from--
2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Right.  
2:37 2:52 MALE:  Like to have some--like say you have a subgroup right, and they want [unintelligible].  The professor sees they are so into it.  They can have a different angle on it, and those angles are the ones that are very applicable and useful.  But the rest are fairly logical.  
2:51 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:54 2:55 MALE:  I don't really like lecturing.  
2:55 2:58 FEMALE:  That's what everyone says, but then when they become professor, that's what they do.  
3:00 3:31 MALE:  Have a [unintelligible] circle, and I [unintelligible].  First the center gets you the objective.  By the end of this course or training, you'll be able to do this, this, this and that, and they say, wow, this looks like a really great thing like I want to [unintelligible] the seminar.  And it's from 8 to 5 with a lunch break for two days.  When it's done, I realize I didn't really learn anything.  It's all just reading of the notes.  
3:32 3:33 FEMALE:  You just know it.  
3:35 3:36 MALE:  And it's like $2,000.  
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Oh, no.  
3:38 3:45 MALE:  So, I definitely think there is a field of contained information.  It needs a lot of work. 
3:43 4:05 FEMALE: Yeah, especially because like there is so much technology available that there's no excuse anymore to just do lectures.  Do you know what I mean?  If they can get it from a web site, they should just get it from a web site.  You know, teaching should be things that they aren't able to do on the web site.  
4:08 4:11 MALE:  So, did you do [unintelligible] for undergrads? 
4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  Oh, no I did political science.  
4:13 4:15 MALE:  Oh, pol sci.  Interesting.  
4:13 4:14 FEMALE:  Well, it was nice to meet you, male109. 
4:16 4:16 FEMALE:  It was nice to meet you female135.
