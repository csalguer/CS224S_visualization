00:17  	00:20  	FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah.  So what are you doing here at Stanford?

00:20  	00:25 	MALE:  I'm in Computer Science.  I'm working in a genetics lab.

00:25	00:25	FEMALE:  Interesting.

00:26	00:29	MALE:  I actually I wanted to do computation in biology.  How about you?

00:30  	00:34  	FEMALE:  Um, I'm in the Ed program in educational policy.

00:34  	00:35  	MALE:  Okay, like --

00:35  	00:38  	FEMALE:  I start my educational certs next year.  But we'll see.

00:37 	00:38	MALE:  Okay.  You're in the Master's program?

00:39	00:40	FEMALE:  Yeah I'm getting my Masters?

00:40	00:41	MALE:  So you know quite a few of these little characters.

00:41	00:46	FEMALE:  Yeah, there was -- they're mostly in one program and I'm in a different program.

00:46	00:46	MALE:  Oh, really, okay.

00:47 	00:49	FEMALE:  But, uh, yeah, we all know each other.

00:50	00:50	MALE:  Okay.

00:51 	00:52  	FEMALE:  And most of us are all [unintelligible].

00:53  	00:53  	MALE:  Yeah.

00:54  	00:55  	FEMALE:  So, helping her out a little bit, but [laughter].

00:55  	0:59  	MALE:  Yeah, are you going to tell me each one of these [unintelligible] [laughter].

00:59  	01:00	FEMALE:  Not quite.  Um, it's so funny though to think you could be like this [unintelligible].

01:05  	01:05  	MALE:  Yeah.

01:08  	01:08  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

01:09  	01:13  	MALE:  Yeah, that's kind of awkward I guess [unintelligible] would know.  Yeah.

01:13  	01:15  	FEMALE:  So where are you from originally?

01:15  	01:16  	MALE:  Minnesota.

01:16  	01:16  	FEMALE:  Oh, Minnesota.

01:17  	01:17  	MALE:  How about you?

01:17  	01:18  	FEMALE:  Rochester, New York.

01:18  	01:20  	MALE:   Okay.  Where did you go to undergrad?

01:21  	01:22  	FEMALE:  I went to William's College.

01:22  	01:23  	MALE:  My roommate went there.

01:24  	01:25  	FEMALE:  Really?  Who?

01:26  	01:28  	MALE:  nameX.  He just went there.  He graduated last June.

01:30  	01:36  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  I might have met [unintelligible] William's happy hour.

01:37  	01:39  	MALE:  Uh-huh, its William's is near Boston, right?

01:39	01:39  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

01:40	01:41  	MALE:  Okay, yeah.

01:41	01:51  	FEMALE:  I might -- I met someone who was back there before who [unintelligible] and asked me if we were doing something sciency, but I don't remember [unintelligible].

01:51	01:52  	MALE:  Yeah, probably, that was probably him.

01:53	01:53  	FEMALE:  Is he really funny?

01:54	01:54  	MALE:  Uh-huh.  Cool.

01:56	01:56  	FEMALE:  So where did you go to school?

01:57	01:57	MALE:  I went to Berkley.

01:58	01:58  	FEMALE:  Oh, okay right around the corner.  Rival schools.

01:59	02:01  	MALE:  Exactly.  Yeah.

02:01	02:01  	FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

02:02	02:09  	MALE:  Try to take them down from the inside here is the plan.

02:09	02:11 	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] in Brooklyn?

02:12	02:12  	MALE:  Berkley.

02:13	02:13	FEMALE:  Really?

02:14	02:18 	MALE:  Yeah and pretty much anyone who went to Brook went to undergrad and now who is here will say the same thing.

02:17	02:26  	FEMALE:  Definitely, I mean [unintelligible], just say Williams [unintelligible] to each other.

02:27	02:30  	MALE:  Yeah.  I think Stanford is probably a lot more fun for the undergrads than grads school.  

02:31	02:31  	FEMALE:  Yeah [unintelligible - cross talking] --

02:32	02:34  	MALE:  Because they all seem to know each other and they're pretty tight.

02:34	02:39	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] in our program and they are all love, love, love, love this place.

02:40	02:40  	MALE:  Yeah.

02:42	02:46  	FEMALE:  So what types of things do you like to do? Outside of computer science.

02:46	02:56  	MALE:  I went to Tahoe earlier this week or earlier this month.  And this weekend I'm going to Vegas with some of the guys I play poker with, so --

02:58   02:59	FEMALE:  I'd like to -- I've never been to Vegas.

02:59	03:00  	MALE:  This is my first time also.

03:00	03:00  	FEMALE:  Really?

03:00	03:01  	MALE:  Yeah.

03:02	03:15  	FEMALE:  I've been to Reno once.  My mom and I actually drove cross country this summer [unintelligible].  So we stopped in Reno, but I can't too much gambling.

03:15	03:16  	MALE:  Yeah.

03:17	03:25	FEMALE:  So we were so tired at that point of driving that we were like you want to stay up late and move some balls around.  [unintelligible].

03:25	03:26  	MALE:  With the money, yeah.

03:26	03:27  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

03:27	03:27  	MALE:  What do you like to do?

03:28	03:31  	FEMALE:  Um, I've been trying to get outside as much as possible.

03:32	03:33  	MALE:  Yeah, with the weather and all.

03:33	03:45	FEMALE:  It's just so gorgeous I went up to Tahoe skiing I went with some friends.  I used to ski a lot in high school, but I hadn't done it in years.  So I was little nervous getting back out there.  But I still remembered how managed to stop.

03:46	03:46  	MALE:  That's good.

03:48	03:48  	FEMALE:  Yeah, so --

03:49	03:53	MALE:  I got roughed up on a few hills there in Tahoe, but --.

03:55	03:57  	FEMALE:  I hear you.  I managed to get roughed up in the parking lot.

03:58	03:59  	MALE:  I know, I even ran into the parking lot sign.

04:00  	04:06	FEMALE:  [unintelligible] and I actually have [horn] a little bit of a scar from [unintelligible].

04:06	04:06  	MALE:  Yeah, uh-huh.

04:07	04:07  	FEMALE:  Well it was nice to meet you.

04:08	04:08  	MALE:  Yeah, nice to meet you.
