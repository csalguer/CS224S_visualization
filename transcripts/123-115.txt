0:31 0:31 FEMALE:  What year are you?
0:26 0:26 MALE:  I'm a third year.
0:33 0:36 FEMALE:  Oh, so are you in a doctoral program?
0:30 0:34 MALE:  Yeah.  Actually, everyone in physics [unintelligible] takes program [unintelligible] PHD program.
0:40 0:42 FEMALE:  They don't give master's in physics?
0:36 0:37 MALE:  They do give master's, but if you just want a master's degree, they don't take you.
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  Okay, right.
0:42 0:44 MALE:  They expect you to want to do it [unintelligible].
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  How many people drop out?
0:47 0:49 MALE:  I don't know the [unintelligible] of that.  But I think not many.
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Really?
0:50 0:55  MALE:  Not many.  I should figure it out.  Probably, I don't know, 10%.
1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  Oh that's not very high at all.
0:57 0:58 MALE:  I know it's not very high.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  That's not high at all.
0:59 0:59 MALE:  So what's your program?
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Law school.
1:01 1:02 MALE:  Oh law school.  And what year are you?
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  I'm a first year.
1:04 1:06 MALE:  Okay.  Everyone so far is first year.
1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  Really?
1:07 1:07 MALE:  Really.
1:13 1:16 FEMALE:  I've met tons of people who aren't in first years.
1:10 1:11 MALE:  Okay.  That means--
1:18 1:19 FEMALE:  Maybe all the women are in their first years.
1:14 1:15 MALE:  Sadly, it seems [unintelligible] at least half the women--
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  Really?
1:17 1:18 MALE:  --are first year.  Yeah, that's funny.
1:24 1:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.  That is funny.  Uh, no, I made a--there's a guy here who's like nine years or something or--
1:24 1:24 MALE:  Oh really?
1:31 1:34 FEMALE:  No, that can't be right.  He did his undergraduate here.  So he's in his 5th year of his program.
1:29 1:30 MALE:  Oh, it must be that.
1:36 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's from engineering or something or other.  Yeah, yeah, it was engineering.
1:35 1:43 MALE:  Well can you imagine being here ten years?  [laughter] I mean, I like Stanford, but I wouldn't spend that much time here.
1:49 1:55 FEMALE:  Not in your 20's either.  I mean, you could maybe settle down here when you're older.  But if you're in your 20's--
1:49 1:49 MALE:  Yeah.
1:55 1:57 FEMALE:  You do not want to spend it here at Stanford.
1:52 1:53 MALE: I know.  I know.
1:58 2:00 FEMALE:  You know?  Where are you originally from?
1:54 1:55 MALE:  I come from Spain.
2:02 2:02 FEMALE:  Oh.
1:57 1:57 MALE:  How about you?
2:04 2:09 FEMALE:  I'm Korean.  I mean, I'm from--I mean, I've been born and raised here.  But I'm Korean.
2:04 2:07 MALE:  Oh.  So where have you been living?  In Ohio?
2:13 2:21 FEMALE:  Um, wow.  I haven't been to Ohio in a lot of years.  I was born there, went to school there.  Then I've been out in L.A. for the past few years, and then I just moved--
2:16 2:16 MALE:  Where?
2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  Los Angeles.
2:16 2:17 MALE:  Oh, I've been there before.
2:23 2:25 FEMALE:  And then I just moved up here, so.
2:20 2:21 MALE:  How do you like Los Angeles?
2:28 2:29 FEMALE:  I really don't like it. 
2:23 2:23 MALE:  Really [laughter]?
2:29 2:30 FEMALE:  Have been down there?
2:25 2:26 MALE:  I was--I spend there like three days.
2:33 2:34 FEMALE:  Oh and what were you doing, just vacation?
2:28 2:36 MALE:  I--that's where I went with a friend to visit it, 'cause I hadn't been yet and I wanted to see how it looks.  And it looks huge.
2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  It is huge.
2:37 2:38 MALE:  It is huge.
2:44 2:45 FEMALE:  It is huge.  Where did you go?
2:40 2:48 MALE:  We went to Santa Monica, Hollywood.  I don't remember.  I mean, we spent half the time on the highway, you know.
2:54 2:56 FEMALE:  Oh, 'cause the traffic is so bad.
2:51 2:51 MALE:  I know.
2:58 2:58 FEMALE:  And just sit there.
2:53 2:57 MALE:  And we went to UCLA as well.  I remember.  And [unintelligible]?
3:04 3:05 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  It's gorgeous.
2:59 2:59 MALE:  That's what I like the most.  I know.
3:06 3:08 FEMALE:  It's beautiful.  Yeah.
3:03 3:03 MALE:  It's really nice.
3:10 3:13 FEMALE:  And the gardens, did you go to the gardens [unintelligible]?
3:07 3:12 MALE:  Oh absolutely.  I'll tell you, that's what I--I didn't look at the interior that much.  [unintelligible] were not that good.
3:18 3:25 FEMALE:  No.  I think the most amazing thing about the [unintelligible] is the architecture, and then the gardens themselves.  But no actual--
3:19 3:19 MALE:  And it was so nice outside. 
3:26 3:27 FEMALE:  Oh Los Angeles is always so nice.
3:21 3:22 MALE:  I know.
3:28 3:29 FEMALE:  It is always so beautiful.
3:24 3:26 MALE:  I know.  And the heat was warmer than here.
3:33 3:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Oh yeah. 
3:28 3:30 MALE:  That's what I noticed.  I could swim in the sea, 'cause--
3:36 3:36 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.
3:30 3:36 MALE:  --here you cannot.  But there, I went to Santa Monica.  It was almost night.
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:37 3:44 MALE:  And you could feel safe.  And then I said, well I'm going to try to the water.  And it was, it was actually warm.  I could get in, you know.  It was a surprise.
3:51 3:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It never gets warm up here.
3:49 3:49 MALE:  I know.
3:56 3:57 FEMALE:  I mean, it's always a little bit chilly.
3:52 3:54 MALE:  Oh yeah.  A little bit towards a lot.
4:00 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:55 3:55 MALE:  Okay.  Nice to meet you.
