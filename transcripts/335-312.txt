0:02 0:04 MALE: female335?  I don't think I said it right. 
0:01 0:02 FEMALE: Yeah, female335.
0:06 0:10 MALE: Mine's male312.  It's pretty [unintelligible]
0:06 0:07 FEMALE: I think I can manage it. 
0:10 0:13 MALE: Okay.  Fair enough.  Wait, what station are we at, sorry?
0:10 0:10 FEMALE: O.
0:14 0:18 MALE: I don't mean to fill our time with [unintelligible]?  Where are we?  Do you know? 
0:15 0:18 FEMALE: O.  O.
0:20 0:24 MALE: Oh, O.  Oh.  Okay.  Sorry, it was like, "Who makes your--who makes your watch?  Guess."  
0:19 0:21 FEMALE: It wasn't an explanation.
0:25 0:27 MALE: Guess, no, it's Guess.
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: [laughter]
0:28 0:30 MALE: Um, all right.  Sorry.  
0:27 0:28 FEMALE: That's okay.
0:30 0:31 MALE: What's going on?
0:28 0:29 FEMALE: Not much. 
0:32 0:33 MALE: This is pretty fun, huh?
0:30 0:30 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:34 0:38 MALE: I feel like I'm, like, 16 [unintelligible] away from you.  Um ,what are you studying?
0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Um, I study, um, biology. 
0:40 0:40 MALE: Oh.
0:37 0:41 FEMALE: Well, so I was a math major in college, and now I study theoretical biology.
0:44 0:47 MALE: What is the difference between theoretical biology and  regular biology?
0:44 0:58 FEMALE: So I joke that it means I'm theoretically a biologist, but really what it is, is it's the modeling of genetic processes.  So using math and statistics to make predictions about what--I study human data, but somebody else in my group studies flu dynamics. 
1:02 1:03 MALE: You study human data?
1:00 1:05 FEMALE: Yeah, so I study the dis--the distribution of genetic variation in human population.
1:08 1:09 MALE: Oh, cool.
1:06 1:06 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:09 1:20 MALE: Well, I was a history major, so I'm a poet. But I took, um--I took, my freshman year, I took, like, genetics for dummies at Princeton, which was actually an awesome class.  You meet all these really, like--
1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Who taught it?  Do you remember?
1:21 1:22 MALE: Shirley Talman [phonetic]?
1:20 1:22 FEMALE: Oh, yeah.  President.
1:24 1:25 MALE: She's--yeah.  
1:22 1:23 FEMALE: Yeah, she's really cool.
1:25 1:27 MALE: She's awesome.  She's a hitter. 
1:24 1:25 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:27 1:33 MALE: Um, but she, um--we did all these things, like, totally above the rim for us.  Like, we did a gel.  
1:31 1:31 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:34 1:37 MALE: We like, you know, did our, like, cheek shells--cheek cells and all this stuff. 
1:35 1:45 FEMALE: That's really fun stuff, though.  That's, like, what I do for--I mean, I don't know how to do that stuff either since I didn't study, um, biology in college.  So now when I do it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is great.  This is fun." 
1:47 1:57 MALE: Yeah, it was cool, but it was definitely, like, introductory.  You know, only know as much as you need to know.  I mean, all my friends who are, like, genetics majors are like, "You did a gel?"  I'm like, "Yeah." [unintelligible] 
1:54 2:00 FEMALE: But oftentimes--I mean, oftentimes, somebody like you would be so much more impressed, probably, than they are with their field.
2:02 2:03 MALE: Yeah, it was awesome. 
2:01 2:01 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:03 2:05 MALE: It was really cool.  She was--she was a great teacher. 
2:03 2:03 FEMALE: That's neat.
2:06 2:07 MALE: So I'm in business school now. 
2:05 2:07 FEMALE: Okay. What, what steered you away from history? 
2:11 2:13 MALE: Uh, I don't--I don't want to go into academia. 
2:09 2:11 FEMALE: Or did you never intend to be [unintelligible]--yeah. 
2:14 2:19 MALE: No, I just wanted to--I just was interested in history, and, like, when I go to the bookstore, I always want to buy history books.
2:17 2:17 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:19 2:29 MALE: But I know I didn't want to, like, write papers.  You know, and, I mean, academia's such a thorny sort of--are you a PhD, or a Master's program?
2:26 2:27 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah. 
2:29 2:30 MALE: So you want to go teach?
2:28 2:30 FEMALE: Yeah.  I want--I want to be a professor, but it's definitely--
2:32 2:38 MALE: But I almost feel like the sciences are different.  I mean, you'll get to do research and do really practical sort of--
2:35 2:42 FEMALE: Yeah. And definitely being--I don't know about the differences being a faculty member, but I think being a grad student is very different in the humanities and sciences. 
2:45 2:45 MALE: Right. 
2:43 2:45 FEMALE: Very different.  I think it can be much less pleasant. 
2:48 2:50 MALE: Much less pleasant in which?  In the Humanities?
2:47 2:51 FEMALE: In the humanities I think just, like, funding situations and time and stuff like that. 
2:52 2:55 MALE: Oh, because there's more money?
2:52 2:55 FEMALE: I don't think the material--I think the material's probably more interesting.
2:57 2:58 MALE: Are you throwing stuff at me?
2:56 2:57 FEMALE: I know.  Look at me.  I'm such a klutz.
3:02 3:18 MALE: There, there's much more funding in the sciences.  Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I don't know.  Plus, it seems like with history, you have to take the [unintelligible] thing, and you know, like, I wanna investigate, like, economic development in South Carolina, 1780 to 1790.
3:16 3:16 FEMALE: Right. 
3:18 3:19 MALE: Like, it's so narrow. 
3:17 3:18 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:21 3:28 MALE: At the end of the day, I would be like, "What?  Who cares?"  I mean, what good is that?  At least you guys get to do something sort of material.
3:26 3:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  So you're first year [unintelligible]?
3:30 3:33 MALE: First year, yeah.  And I lived out here before school for five years.
3:31 3:32 FEMALE: Oh, wow.
3:34 3:36 MALE: I keep on trying to move away from here. 
3:34 3:37 FEMALE: Yeah, I know.  I'm from Sacramento.  It's a hard place to leave. 
3:39 3:40 MALE: Oh, you are?  Wow.
3:37 3:38 FEMALE: Once you're, like, from California. 
3:41 3:44 MALE: I mean, I'm from New York.  I came out here after school.
3:42 3:44 FEMALE: No, I'm much worse.
3:46 3:48 MALE: You're much--you're like--you're like, "I have to be here?"
3:45 3:51 FEMALE: Well, I'm at the point where I have to leave, now, after I finish grad school because, um, I went here for college also.
3:51 3:55 MALE: You're not gonna leave.
3:52 3:53 FEMALE: No, I will.  I will.
3:56 3:59 MALE: No, you know everybody here.  I mean you've created a network here.
3:56 4:01 FEMALE: Yeah, but it actually is getting to the point where my friends are disbursing, so I think it's time. 
4:05 4:06 MALE: All right.  Well, it's nice to meet you. 
4:04 4:04 FEMALE: Nice to meet you. 
4:07 4:07 MALE: Have a good night. 
4:05 4:05 FEMALE: You, too.
