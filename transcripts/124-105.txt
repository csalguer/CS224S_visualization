0:11 0:11 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:13 0:15 MALE:  Nice to you meet you.  So what department are you in?
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] education.
0:17 0:20 MALE:  You don't have the pink card, so you kind of threw me off.
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  The pink card?
0:21 0:27 MALE:  I think three out of the people I've seen from the school of education have a little pink card on top of their name tag.
0:26 0:29 FEMALE:  Oh I don't.  I'm missing out.
0:31 0:31 MALE:  I know.  That's all right.
0:30 0:32 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:33 0:34 MALE:  Well you have a cool shirt, so it's okay.
0:35 0:36 FEMALE:  Well thanks.  I like your shirt [unintelligible] cool.
0:36 0:38 MALE:  Thank you.  It's my favorite shirt, so.
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] good shirt.
0:42 0:44 MALE:  [laughter] So how are you doing so far?
0:43 0:48 FEMALE:  Doing pretty good.  Kind of [unintelligible] experience, but it's fun.
0:50 0:51 MALE:  Had you ever done anything like this?
0:49 0:50 FEMALE:  No, no.
0:52 0:52 MALE:  Join the club.
0:51 0:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, I know.  [unintelligible].  So what are you studying here?
0:56 0:57 MALE:  Mechanical engineering.
0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Okay.  [unintelligible].
0:59 0:59 MALE:  Which is kind of fun.
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:02 1:04 MALE:  Um, currently a Masters, working towards PHD, so.
1:04 1:07 FEMALE:  Okay.  So how long [unintelligible] three years?  Two years?
1:08 1:30 MALE:  The Masters, um, some people do it in a year.  Most people do it in, um, a year and a half.  And the PHD in--I know people who have gotten out in three, and met people who it took them five.  And then, I met one guy in biology who's been here for nine years.  And I really didn't know what to say, except--
1:30 1:31 FEMALE:  Oh okay.
1:32 1:36 MALE:  Yeah.  'Cause I really wanted to say I'm sorry.
1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:37 1:43 MALE:  But that just didn't seem right [unintelligible].  I don't know what to say.  What are you studying in education?
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:45 1:50 MALE:  Nice.  So do you want to work in kind of a support role for the schools or research?
1:49 1:53 FEMALE:  I'm not sure yet.  And I just graduated from undergrad last June.
1:55 1:56 MALE:  Oh, right on.
1:54 2:06 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] master's program, um, so I haven't really had an opportunity to have a full time job in education.  So I'm thinking about teaching, [unintelligible] that would be a good thing to do [unintelligible].  But I'm also thinking [unintelligible].
2:08 2:11 MALE:  Didn't you have to do, like, the practical for your undergrad?
2:10 2:10 FEMALE:  A what?
2:12 2:13 MALE:  Practical, like student teaching?
2:12 2:15 FEMALE:  Um, no because I didn't major in education.
2:16 2:17 MALE:  Oh.
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  There's no education major for undergrads.
2:19 2:19 MALE:  Okay.
2:18 2:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So at Stanford, if you want to go into teaching, you join a program [unintelligible] little bit, then you get your teacher's credentials and your master's as [unintelligible].
2:35 2:35 MALE:  That's nice.
2:30 2:45 FEMALE:  So that's kind of the only [unintelligible] available to undergrads [unintelligible] way into teaching.  I mean, there's not really very many classes offered [unintelligible] open to undergrads.  [unintelligible].
2:46 2:48 MALE:  Nice.  What particular period in time?
2:47 2:52 FEMALE:  Um, I started out with Latin American history, [unintelligible] revolution Mexico.
2:55 2:55 MALE:  Woa.
2:54 3:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Also, a lot of Mexican politics and um, yeah.  But they're [unintelligible] different [unintelligible] area with professors and classes and stuff.  So I switched to [unintelligible] my senior year.
3:13 3:17 MALE:  Okay.  So have you been down and visited any places in Mexico?
3:16 3:20 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I was [unintelligible].
3:21 3:22 MALE:  Oh nice.  Where to?
3:22 3:37 FEMALE:  All over.  I've been to [unintelligible].  I've been to [unintelligible].
3:39 3:40 MALE:  Did you get to see the mummies?  
3:39 3:41 FEMALE:  Yes, I did see the mummies, and they are really gross.
3:42 3:42 MALE:  They are?
3:41 3:50 FEMALE:  I mean, they were really fascinating, and it's cool to see that, but it's just kind of gross.  [unintelligible].
3:51 3:53 MALE:  But that's some cool stuff, like the [unintelligible].
3:52 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:54 3:55 MALE:  I'm from Africa.
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  Where are you from in--
3:57 3:57 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:56 4:02 FEMALE:  Oh okay.  [unintelligible].
4:01 4:03 MALE:  Oh nice.  Well nice to meet you.
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
