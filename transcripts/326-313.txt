0:00:00.0 0:00:05.2 MALE:  These things are kind of detailed for one minute.  I'm just like, six, six, six, six.
0:00:03.1 0:00:08.6 FEMALE:  They are.  And it's like, I don't know.  I just go down the middle [laughter].
0:00:06.8 0:00:10.1 MALE:  Yeah.  If I have- it's either five or six.  If I didn't feel strongly one way or the other.
0:00:11.4 0:00:11.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:11.5 0:00:14.1 MALE:  And I think I'm doing normal curve, so nobody's getting one's or ten's.
0:00:15.5 0:00:15.9 FEMALE:  Oh that's good.
0:00:15.5 MALE:  I don't know.  I don't know if it's supposed to be that way.
0:00:18.2 0:00:24.9 FEMALE:  I think I met one guy who was doing like, one's or ten's.  And I was like, oh [laughter].  I was like, that's kind of scary [laughter].
0:00:20.6 0:00:28.1 MALE:  [unintelligible].  Wow.  Well not if you're a ten I guess.  Wow.  That's very decisive guy.
0:00:30.4 0:00:32.6 FEMALE:  Apparently. [laughter] 
0:00:31.4 0:00:42.2 MALE:  Yeah.  I had a lot of trouble- well not trouble, but, filling out that survey, like rate, you know, the following things.  You have a hundred points to allocate.
0:00:41.8 0:00:47.0 FEMALE:  It's like, I don't know.  I don't know- yeah.  I'm like I can't add to a hundred, I'm sorry.  It's like-  [laughter] 
0:00:44.2 0:00:44.8 [horn]
0:00:42.8 0:00:50.0 MALE:  It's oh my gosh.  It's like, well I have zero from the last four things.  Now what?  [unintelligible] 
0:00:47.4 0:00:51.0 FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah.  [unintelligible].
0:00:50.0 0:00:51.4 MALE:  Anyway.  Okay.  I'm male313.
0:00:52.5 0:00:52.9 FEMALE:  I'm female326.
0:00:51.8 0:00:52.7 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:00:53.0 0:00:54.6 FEMALE:  [laughter] You too.
0:00:53.8 0:00:54.9 MALE:  So how are things going?
0:00:56.5 0:00:58.8 FEMALE:  Okay.  It's very, um, hectic.
0:00:58.3 0:00:58.8 MALE:  Yeah.
0:00:59.3 0:01:00.0 FEMALE:  I feel like- 
0:00:58.7 0:00:59.5 MALE:  It is hectic.  
0:01:00.3 0:01:01.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But- 
0:01:00.6 0:01:05.4 MALE:  I don't know.  I mean, four minutes- maybe it's about right, because there are probably some people you don't want to talk even for four minutes.
0:01:06.1 0:01:09.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Some people are kind of like, [unintelligible] again [laughter]?
0:01:08.1 0:01:12.7 MALE:  Have you really had that awkward silence?  What do you do?  Just make up a question?
0:01:10.4 0:01:17.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I just kind of like keep rambling.  [unintelligible] I kind of do.
0:01:15.0 0:01:37.3 MALE:  Yeah.  There's actually a girl over there who has a book of- like the book of questions.  I don't know if you've seen this book.  It's like a hundred random questions.  And she's like flipping through it.  It's like, okay, put your finger on the book.  I put my finger in the book, and it was like a question- it was like, would you rather have, you know, fifty thousand dollars a year but never be able to earn any more money, or be able to earn as much money as you want, but not have a guaranteed income.
0:01:39.1 0:01:43.8 FEMALE:  You're like, uh, I don't know [laughter].  It depends on the work.
0:01:38.3 0:01:44.0 MALE:  [laughter] And then, she's like, this one sucks.  So she gave me a different question.  I was just like- 
0:01:45.4 0:01:46.1 FEMALE:  That's kind of scary.
0:01:44.9 0:01:49.6 MALE:  It's kind of bizarre.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't put her down [laughter].
0:01:46.7 0:01:53.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little scary.  You're like, [laughter] awkward silences.
0:01:51.6 0:01:56.8 MALE:  Is the book going to come with us on every date [laughter]?  Anytime it gets- okay, here's- I don't know.
0:01:54.1 0:02:02.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] I guess if it was kind of like random questions, but I guess if it's not, you know, then it's [unintelligible] 
0:02:01.2 0:02:09.5 MALE:  Yeah.  I went to one of these where they basically asked you a conversation starter every time.  That was okay, but not for the reason they thought.  The question was totally lame.
0:02:10.6 0:02:11.8 FEMALE:  Did you start laughing at it?
0:02:10.4 0:02:12.8 MALE:  But yeah.  You had something to mock [laughter] kind of in common. 
0:02:13.1 0:02:17.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] 
0:02:12.9 0:02:20.7 MALE:  So that was like the only common ground.  This is totally lame.  Yeah.  It is.  Maybe that was the intent.  Maybe they actually were smart.  I kind of doubt it.
0:02:17.6 0:02:18.6 FEMALE:  What kind of question is that?
0:02:21.6 0:02:22.8 MALE:   Anyway, so what are you studying?
0:02:23.8 0:02:24.8 FEMALE:  Uh, material science.
0:02:24.1 0:02:24.6 MALE:  Say again?
0:02:25.6 0:02:26.3 FEMALE:  Material science.
0:02:25.0 0:02:26.2 MALE:  Material science.  Cool.
0:02:26.8 0:02:28.9 FEMALE:  Engineering.  So yeah.
0:02:26.8 0:02:29.7 MALE:  Great.  I'm doing C.S., also engineering.
0:02:30.5 0:02:32.0 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.
0:02:31.2 0:02:32.6 MALE:  I guess everyone's doing C.S. though.
0:02:33.6 0:02:35.6 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
0:02:33.0 0:02:34.5 MALE:  I think material science is more exotic.
0:02:36.1 0:02:39.0 FEMALE:  It's new, I think, so- especially here.
0:02:38.4 0:02:42.4 MALE:  So what are you working with?  Like- like ceramics?  I mean, I don't even know what the categories are.
0:02:42.1 0:02:43.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's solar cells.
0:02:43.0 0:02:43.9 MALE:  Solar cells.
0:02:44.8 0:02:56.2 FEMALE:  So solar cell materials, [unintelligible].  Yeah.  [unintelligible] pretty cool stuff.  But I'm- you would probably appreciate this.  I actually interviewed at Google this morning for a marketing position.  So-
0:02:54.5 0:02:56.0 MALE:  All right.  Do you think you're going to get it?
0:02:57.3 0:02:58.5 FEMALE:  I don't know.  It was my second interview.
0:02:57.3 0:02:59.0 MALE:  They're really hard, right?  To get-
0:03:00.5 0:03:01.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, it was- 
0:02:59.7 0:03:01.1 MALE:  I think everybody wants to work at Google.
0:03:02.5 0:03:17.8 FEMALE:  Yeah, I- I mean, it was kind of nice, 'cause I took the phone screen, and then I went in today.  And so, I mean, it's kind of progressing.  But I'll know how I did today.  [laughter] I don't know anything about marketing, you know.  They're like, oh what would you advertise this?  I'm like, uh, in the store [laughter]?  So-
0:03:15.8 0:03:21.2 MALE:  Wow.  So did they- did they give you a particular Google products and make you come up with a sales pitch or something?
0:03:22.0 0:03:25.0 FEMALE:  Yes.  [laughter] And then they make you do all the math- 
0:03:23.1 0:03:25.5 MALE:  No pressure.  They make you do math?
0:03:25.6 0:03:28.3 FEMALE:  -like how many cats you think there are in the United States.
0:03:27.4 0:03:28.5 MALE:  Oh like [unintelligible] problems.
0:03:30.2 0:03:31.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Stuff like that.
00:03:30.4 0:03:30.9 MALE:  Was that- 
0:03:31.3 0:03:37.2 FEMALE:  Which actually that was okay.  It was kind of fun, 'cause, you know, you've been in engineering for long enough, you're kind of like, oh well you know, that's probably about right.  And then- 
0:03:34.7 0:03:36.4 MALE:  And they're not going to prove you wrong, right?
0:03:38.5 0:03:40.5 FEMALE:  I don't know. [laughter]  
0:03:38.9 0:03:41.0 MALE:  I mean, I don't know, maybe they actually did know the number.
0:03:42.5 0:03:43.1 FEMALE:  They might.
0:03:42.1 0:03:44.2 MALE:  I think within an order of ninety two, they say you're okay.
0:03:45.2 0:03:45.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:44.0 0:03:45.5 MALE:  Is that- is that the question you had?
0:03:47.1 0:03:56.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I had that, and then I had, how many ping pong balls are in the United States?  And then, how many [unintelligible]- or how many people come into domestic turmoil SFO a day?
0:03:55.7 0:03:56.9 MALE:  That they might have the answer to.
0:03:57.9 0:04:03.9 FEMALE:  Stuff like that.  And I was kind of like, [laughter].  All I [unintelligible] five hundred million people in the United States, and then go from there.
0:04:00.1 0:04:05.7 MALE:  Well a lot of those- Yeah.  A lot of [unintelligible] like, okay, how many ping pong balls per capita.
0:04:06.7 0:04:07.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:04:06.4 0:04:07.5 MALE:  That's got to be easier to- 
0:04:08.2 0:04:11.5 FEMALE:  How many people come across a ping pong ball a day [laughter]?  You know and then [unintelligible] 
0:04:10.4 0:04:13.2 MALE:  And how many cats per- you'd have to- you've got the cat lady that's got thirty cats.
0:04:14.1 0:04:15.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] 
0:04:13.8 0:04:16.5 MALE:  And you got people with no cats.  So maybe it's an average of- what- I don't know.
0:04:17.4 0:04:18.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, just- 
0:04:17.7 0:04:19.5 MALE:  I'm not sure how many of those cat ladies there are.
0:04:20.6 0:04:23.8 FEMALE:  They're challenging.  But it was- I mean, it's interesting, at least.  So they're asking- 
0:04:22.0 0:04:24.1 MALE:  Yeah.  A friend of mine just got a job at Google, actually.  
0:04:25.1 0:04:25.6 FEMALE:  Oh really?
0:04:24.9 0:04:28.4 MALE:  So he's pretty excited.  He had the Google t-shirt, you know.  It says "I'm feeling lucky" on the back.
0:04:27.5 0:04:34.6 FEMALE:  [laughter] He had a year off.  If he had come a year earlier, he would be rich.
0:04:33.8 0:04:34.4 MALE:  Yeah.
0:04:35.7 0:04:36.8 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:04:35.9 0:04:39.0 MALE:  Yeah.  I'm just a little bit too old [unintelligible].  
0:04:39.1 0:04:39.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04:39.3 0:04:41.7 MALE:  Yeah.  I mean, I just kind of missed out on the tech thing.  
0:04:42.9 0:04:44.6 FEMALE:  Are you in the PhD program or the master's?
0:04:43.7 0:04:44.4 MALE:  Uh, PhD.
0:04:43.9 0:04:44.5 [horn]
0:04:45.8 0:04:46.9 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  That's going to be a while.
0:04:45.5 0:04:47.2 MALE:  I'll be here for a while, I think.
0:04:47.7 0:04:48.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04:48.8 0:04:49.9 MALE:  Anyway, it was good meeting you.
0:04:50.4 0:04:51.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, you too.
0:04:50.3 0:04:50.7 MALE:  Good luck.
0:04:51.7 0:04:52.2 FEMALE:  You too.
