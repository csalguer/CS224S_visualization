0:00 0:01 MALE: Ohh.
0:02 0:02 FEMALE: Great.  [laughter]
0:06 0:06 MALE: Alright, nice to meet you.  [laughter]
0:06 0:06 FEMALE: Good to meet you.
0:13 0:14 MALE: I'm so far behind on these!  [laughter]
0:13 0:17 FEMALE: [laughter]  I know!  You have to like get frantic in between.  
0:19 0:25 MALE: Sorry, um.  Okay.  
0:26 0:26 FEMALE: How's it going?
0:27 0:28 MALE: So, how's it been going?
0:29 0:31 FEMALE: This is crazy.  I had no idea it would be like, "Okay, oh my god."
0:31 0:40 MALE: I know.  But they should give us a little more time to fill out the cards, you know.  'Cause I feel like that it's not going to be that useful if you don't.  It's good anyway, but-- 
0:39 0:49 FEMALE: Yeah.  Well, I feel like, I mean I thought, like we go into this with this idea that, "Oh, people decide what they think of people so fast," and I'm like, "My god, they sit down and then they leave again."  
0:49 0:57 MALE: Especially, you know, someone [unintelligible] or stuff.  So, I never heard, what are you, so what are you studying within-- it's evolutionary biology, I guess the broader-- 
0:56 1:08 FEMALE: Uh, ecology, actually, so the- the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  What I do isn't, I mean, all of biology is about evolution, but it's not, um, so I'm studying global change biology, so the response of plants to environmental change.  
1:09 1:14 MALE: That's cool.  Have you already picked out your dissertation and everything, or that's like way down the far?
1:12 1:15 FEMALE: So, I'm actually defending my proposal a week from tomorrow.  
1:16 1:19 MALE: Oh my god.  That means quals are behind you, and now--
1:18 1:20 FEMALE: No, this is quals.  So, it's--
1:20 1:23 MALE: Oh, that's interesting, you don't take a, you know substantive-- biology.
1:21 1:27 FEMALE: It's not- it's not like a substantive quals, it's just a proposal defense for us.  Um.
1:28 1:32 MALE: And what happens, do you write up like a little abstract, and the professors just go at you?
1:32 1:38 FEMALE: Uh, you write up like, mine's like ten pages, um, and give like a 20 minute talk, and then, yeah, they interrogate you. 
1:41 1:42 MALE: That sounds fun. [laughter]
1:42 1:42 FEMALE: [laughter]  
1:44 1:46 MALE: Are you taking any classes at the same time?  
1:45 1:46 FEMALE: I am, I'm taking one class.
1:47 1:48 MALE: What kind of class?
1:48 1:50 FEMALE: Biogene chemistry.  Um.
1:51 1:52 MALE: That sounds-- does sound right.
1:51 1:56 FEMALE: Which is great, it's- it's- I mean, [unintelligible] on my committee and I've done a project with him and he's really awesome.  
1:58 1:58 MALE: Hm.
1:58 2:04 FEMALE: It's great to like get his view of the world in his class, but I'm just kind of like, oh my god, I have to do this defense thing.
2:05 2:14 MALE: It's the last thing you want to think about.  Right, it's, so God.  So now I've got to ask, what is it like a three year, four year project, do you think?  For your, you know, you actually get started on.
2:13 2:19 FEMALE: Yeah, you know, you have to write up a timeline where you write the proposal.  Which- which is funny, because it-- Oh.  
2:19 2:21 MALE: So it's like totally [unintelligible]
2:20 2:21 FEMALE: But it's totally arbitrary.  
2:22 2:22 MALE: Yeah.
2:21 2:33 FEMALE: Like you go, "Okay, well I'm supposed to be out of here in five years, so I guess I'll say that I'm going to defend this time," and like just randomly fill in the rest.  Um, I think most of my data collection's going to be next year, um, so--
2:34 2:36 MALE: So, is it, you're getting out into the field, anywherer exotic?
2:36 2:38 FEMALE: Unfortunately, um, no, I'm working at-- 
2:39 2:41 MALE: What kind of dissertation is this?
2:40 2:43 FEMALE: I know.  I know.  But, I'm really- I'm really excited about this--
2:44 2:44 MALE: No, that's--
2:43 2:45 FEMALE: --where I'm working, it's at Jasper Ridge, which is, yeah.
2:46 2:46 MALE:  Oh, yeah.
2:46 2:46 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:47 2:50 MALE: Which I've never been to, but I mean, I heard about it, like as an undergrad and everything, and--
2:49 2:50 FEMALE: It's amazing.
2:51 2:51 MALE: Where is it?  
2:52 2:59 FEMALE: It's- it's just west of here.  It's-- If you take Sandhill past 280, you go, I don't know, like three miles past 280, and it's on the left.  
3:00 3:02 MALE: Oh, well I've totally driven past it.  
3:01 3:01 FEMALE: Okay.
3:02 3:05 MALE: Okay, yeah, I can get like a vague idea of what it must be like.
3:03 3:07 FEMALE: Yeah, it's like right before you reach, I think Portola Road, there's like this locked gate, that's it.  
3:09 3:14 MALE: [unintelligible] so you need special permission to uh-- this is why you're really here doing your dissertation.
3:13 3:15 FEMALE: [laughter] Just so that I can get into [unintelligible]
3:15 3:17 MALE: Entree into, yeah.
3:16 3:25 FEMALE: No, there's a really awesome, ongoing experiment there.  Looking at the effects of environmental change on a, on grassland, and [unintelligible] stone.  So, so I'm working on that project.  
3:26 3:32 MALE: So what comes a-- I mean, are you thinking of like teaching, or more interested in like research institute type work?
3:32 3:44 FEMALE: Um, I mean, both.  It- it's not um, like most jobs that I could get with a Ph.D. in biology would involve both.  Um, And I'm, at this point, I don't think I can afford to be picky about it, you know.  
3:46 3:47 MALE: That's the industry for you, yeah.
3:47 3:47 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:48 3:51 MALE: That's totally fair.  Wow.  So that sounds pretty good.
3:51 3:51 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:52 3:52 MALE: Are you enjoying it?
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: What's that?
3:53 3:55 MALE: Are you enjoying this?  Is it kind of what you expected?  
3:56 3:58 FEMALE: I don't know.  It's funny [laughter] what about you?
4:00 4:08 MALE: Well, you know, I did this once before, and it's kind of hard to [horn] [unintelligible] I mean, you know, I think the whole thing's sort of a numbers game.  You know, I mean, just like dating in general.
4:08 4:08 FEMALE: [unintelligible]
4:08 4:13 MALE: And you have to meet, meeting like 16 people and take it seriously, you know?  
4:13 4:14 FEMALE: I know, that's true--
4:14 4:15 MALE: It's just totally bizarre.
4:14 4:15 FEMALE: Play the odds, yeah.
4:15 4:21 MALE: But it's so much better than meeting someone randomly in a bar.  At least you have like a semi-substantive-- You know what I mean?
4:20 4:22 FEMALE: [laughter]  Right.
4:22 4:24 MALE: So, wait, I'm sorry, what station is this?  
4:24 4:24 FEMALE: L.
4:27 4:27 MALE: [whispering]
4:28 4:28 FEMALE: [laughter]
