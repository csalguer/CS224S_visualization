0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  [laughter] This is so bad. 
0:04 0:05 MALE:  Yeah.   
0:12 0:23 FEMALE:  Du, du, du, du.  This is too hard.  All right.  
0:24 0:24 MALE:  Okay. 
0:25 0:25 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:26 0:26 MALE:  So how's it going so far? 
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  Good.  How about you?  
0:29 0:29 MALE:  Yeah, good. 
0:30 0:33 FEMALE:  They're a lot shorter then they seem to be, you're like right in the middle of a story--
0:34 0:34 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  --and then all of a sudden the buzzer buzzes and you're ready to go. 
0:37 0:40 MALE:  So tell me about yourself.  Where are you from?  What do you do? 
0:41 0:45 FEMALE:  Ah, I'm here for an MBA, which is a lot of fun.  
0:46 0:46 MALE:  Okay. 
0:46 0:48 FEMALE:  So it's sort of my paid vacation that I'm paying for.  [laughter] 
0:49 0:50 MALE:  Okay.  What were you doing before? 
0:51 0:54 FEMALE:  Uh, but it's great.  I was doing uh, finance in New York so--
0:55 0:55 MALE:  Okay. 
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  --first I was in investment banking and then I was in private equity. 
0:57 0:57 MALE:  Wow. 
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  But I'm looking to go into entertainment, so--
1:00 1:00 MALE:  [laughter] Okay. 
1:01 1:02 FEMALE:  --big career transition.  
1:03 1:03 MALE:  Okay. Entertainment. 
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  So I'm spending the summer in L.A., which I'm excited about.  
1:06 1:06 MALE:  Right. Okay. 
1:07 1:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, I've never been, I've never spent much time in L.A., so I'm excited.  Although now that I've been living in California, I feel like I want to be a California girl.  [laughter]
1:16 1:16 MALE:  [laughter] Okay.  
1:17 1:17 FEMALE:  I'm done. 
1:18 1:18 MALE:  You fell for the big city?  
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:  What about you? 
1:19 1:23 MALE:  I'm from the U.K., I'm from London.  Uh, I've only been here for five or six weeks.
1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  
1:25 1:26 MALE:  I'm studying genetics.  Yeah. 
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Genetics? 
1:28 1:28 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:28 1:31 FEMALE:  Are you um, so have you lived in the U.S. before? 
1:32 1:34 MALE:  No, I've visited plenty of times, but--
1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  How do you like it?  
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Yeah, it's good so far. 
1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:37 1:37 MALE:  It's very different, very different. 
1:38 1:45 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I was in London over the summer and I was just blown away by how ridiculously expensive everything was.  
1:46 1:47 MALE:  Yeah.  It's quite, yeah.  
1:48 1:51 FEMALE:  [laughter] I was like [laughter], I would love to come to stay longer but I can't afford it. 
1:52 1:52 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:53 1:57 FEMALE:  It's just crazy.  But I guess they, you know, you get paid enough so it's fine.  
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Well. 
1:58 2:00 FEMALE:  But--
2:01 2:03 MALE:  We have different benefits, like the National Health Service and education--
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  Right. 
2:04 2:04 MALE:  --and stuff, so that helps, but on the whole it is a bit more expensive.  
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  So what part of London did you live in? 
2:11 2:13 MALE:  East London.  Yeah, you can probably tell if you were more familiar with the accents.  [laughter] 
2:14 2:16 FEMALE:  [laughter] No, no, I'm not that good. 
2:17 2:17 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
2:18 2:26 FEMALE:  [laughter] London's actually, England's a place that I'd like to spend more time, I've just, I've been too focused on mainland Europe and not enough focused on uh--
2:27 2:28 MALE:  Okay, where have you been to in Europe? 
2:29 2:29 FEMALE:  Oh, everywhere, but--[laughter] 
2:30 2:30 MALE:  Okay, okay. 
2:31 2:33 FEMALE:  This past summer I spent most of time in Eastern Europe.  
2:34 2:34 MALE:  Wow.
2:35 2:38 FEMALE:  Um, which was a lot of fun, and took um, a boat cruise on--
2:39 2:39 MALE:  Holiday, or?  
2:40 2:44 FEMALE:  --yeah on holiday, and then um, was on the Dalmatian coast in Croatia for awhile, which was very nice.  
2:45 2:45 MALE:  Wow.
2:46 2:50 FEMALE:  Um, and then I also studied in France, um, when I was in college. 
2:51 2:51 MALE:  Wow.
2:51 2:54 FEMALE:  But just not enough time in the U.K.  But I'll have to fix that. [laughter] 
2:55 2:56 MALE:  [laughter] 
2:57 2:57 FEMALE:  Once I get some money.  [laughter] 
2:58 2:59 MALE:  What attracted to Eastern Europe? 
3:00 3:02 FEMALE:  Um, just because it's such a--
3:03 3:03 MALE:  It's different; it's something that you don't know much about.  
3:04 3:22 FEMALE:  It's very different, but what's amazing--when I was studying in France, I went to Prague, and that was really the only part of Eastern Europe that I went to, and I was like blown away because it was so different then--I had just misconceptions about it, and it was like this Toyland, baby Paris almost.  
3:23 3:23 MALE:  Right. 
3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  And it's totally overrun by tourists, worse now.
3:25 3:25 MALE:  Right. 
3:26 3:35 FEMALE:  And so when I was thinking about where I wanted to go for the summer, I wanted to try to capture, you know, that experience back when I was in college before it was totally overrun by tourists.  
3:36 3:36 MALE:  Right. 
3:37 3:50 FEMALE:  Um, so some of the other cities, that are still, you know, have a fair amount of tourists there, but they're more European tourists, then American tourists, which I think is a little bit of a different vibe.  What about you?  Did you do any traveling? 
3:51 3:53 MALE:  Uh, yeah, mainly in North America.  [laughter] 
3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:54 4:00 MALE:  So I went the other way.  [laughter]  Yeah, spent some time in Holland as well, just short holidays really.  
4:01 4:01 FEMALE:  Right. 
           [horn]
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  That was so short.  [laughter] 
4:04 4:04 MALE:  Okay, yeah.  Good luck. 
4:04 4:04 FEMALE:  Well it was very nice to meet you.  
4:05 4:08 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
