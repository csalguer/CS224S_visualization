1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:06 1:08 MALE:  And there's just so many Princeton people there.

1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Really?

1:09 1:10 MALE:  It's like--it's insane.

1:10 1:10 FEMALE:  That's cool.

1:11 1:14 MALE:  So, what--you--and you were pre med obviously.  Did you have another major or...?

1:15 1:20 FEMALE:  Um, actually, I wasn't pre med during under grad.  I--I, um, I was [unintelligible] microbiology and physics.

1:20 1:22 MALE:  Uh-huh.  And then you just--you just did the courses afterward and...?

1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

1:24 1:24 MALE:  Awesome.

1:24 1:31 FEMALE:  I, uh, I--I started out in biophysics and then I changed my mind.  I liked working with people rather than pie [unintelligible].

1:31 1:32 MALE:  Wow.  People more than, yeah.
 
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:33 1:34 MALE:  And, uh, where are you from originally?

1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  From Tennessee.

1:35 1:37 MALE:  Whereabouts?  Nashville or Memphis?

1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  Oakridge.

1:37 1:38 MALE:  Where is that near, is that in the West or the East?

1:39 1:39 FEMALE:  East--eastside.

1:39 1:43 MALE:  Eastside.  Awesome.  Cool.  I'm originally from San Diego.

1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

1:44 1:56 MALE:  I--I went here under grad.  I was in '99 too.  Then, uh, I went to New York and I worked in a bank and then I was transferred to Paris for a year and I ended up staying for four years, and now I'm back in the business school so that's my story.

1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  What do you want to do?

1:58 2:04 MALE:  Um, probably--I'll probably go back into finance, not banking per say, but something like that so.

2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  Um-hum.  Wow.

2:05 2:06 MALE:  It's a big question.

2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Did you like Paris?

2:07 2:12 MALE:  I had a great time in Paris.  I mean, I was only supposed to be there for a year and I ended up, you know, staying for four so.

2:12 2:13 FEMALE:  It's one of my favorite cities.

2:13 2:14 MALE:  Yeah.

2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:14 2:17 MALE:  Yeah, I really had a good time there, so.  How do you like, uh, medical school?

2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  I really like it, um--

2:20 2:20 MALE:  That's good.

2:21 2:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I think having chosen later in my life I--I'm really committed to it.

2:24 2:25 MALE:  Are you more focused and--yeah, exactly.

2:26 2:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, like, this is--I definitely want to do this [unintelligible] it's really great.  

2:28 2:29 MALE:  Well, that's good.

2:29 2:36 FEMALE:  I mean we just--it's just so neat what we get to do on a daily basis.  Like, one day I'll get to look at that classmate's eye, look at the back of her retina and--

2:37 2:37 MALE:  Right.

2:37 2:42 FEMALE:  --and the next day we'll be learning about--we'll go to a patient--like a dermatology clinic and look at the different skin diseases and just--

2:43 2:45 MALE:  Not to mention the gross anatomy and the cadavers and--

2:45 2:53 FEMALE:  Yeah, that stuff, I mean, I like what I learn.  I'm not--I--I couldn't eat meat for--for two weeks after starting that class, but--

2:53 2:55 MALE:  I have a--my best friend who is actually graduating this year from medical school--

2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:57 3:02 MALE:  And the stories that she would tell, like, you know coming home from lab and there'd be chips of bone in her hair and it just--oh.

3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.

3:04 3:05 MALE:  You'd get grease everywhere.  [laughter].

3:06 3:17 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it smelled awful.  I mean, it was like the worst--especially if you have a very obese, uh, cadaver, which is what I had.  It was just--smelled awful.

3:18 3:18 MALE:  Did you name yours?

3:19 3:25 FEMALE:  No, I don't think we were encouraged to actually do that so.  Because they have real names, they were real people, right?

3:25 3:32 MALE:  [laughter]  I can see how that--I can see how that would be a problem.  Yeah.  You have to sort of respect that.  But, uh, and--that's--is that a semester or is it just a quarter?

3:33 3:35 FEMALE:  It--for us it was, uh, two quarters. 

3:36 3:36 MALE:  Two quarters.

3:37 3:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.  One full-time and then the second time like only once a week.  Yeah.

3:41 3:43 MALE:  That's in the building right next to, uh, the museum, isn't it?

3:44 3:47 FEMALE:  Hmm, no.  CCSR, it's near the med school.

3:47 3:48 MALE:  Near the med school?

3:48 3:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.  

3:49 3:53 MALE:  I--I--there's--'cause there's a--it must be like the old anatomy building is right near there.

3:53 3:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I think it used to be [unintelligible] yeah.

3:54 3:57 MALE:  Is that what it is?  So...  And do you live on campus or off?

3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  I'm on campus.

3:59 3:59 MALE:  In Escondido or...?

4:00 4:00 FEMALE:  Escondido.

4:01 4:02 MALE:  Well, nice meeting you.

4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's fantastic stuff.

4:03 4:04 MALE:  Okay.  Take care.

4:05 4:05 FEMALE:  Take care.
