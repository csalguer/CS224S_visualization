0:02 0:02   FEMALE:  M. 

0:03 0:03 MALE:  Okay. 

0:03 0:04 FEMALE: I guess.  That's what I'm hoping.  [unintelligible], so I hope it's the right. 

0:10 0:10 MALE:  All right, because I always forget that stage and then when it's --  

0:12 0:12 FEMALE:  No, its just M.  

0:15 0:15 MALE:  I'm male206. 

0:15 0:17 FEMALE:  male206, oh no way.  Look at me. 

0:19 0:20 MALE:  Oh cool.

0:23 0:24 MALE:  The feminine name.  Nice.  Where are you from? 

0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  Mexico. 

0:29 0:29 MALE:  Cool.  And what are you studying? 

0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  I'm getting a PhD in law school. 

0:33 0:33 MALE:  In what? 

0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  In law school. 

0:35 0:36 MALE:  What year? 

0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  Second year. 

0:39 0:40 MALE:  And how long have you been in the States? 

0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  Three years, I came from [unintelligible]. 

0:44 0:45 MALE:  Just for Stanford? 

0:45 0:45 FEMALE:  Yes. 

0:45 0:46 MALE:  So you went to undergrad in this State? 

0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]. 

0:50 0:52 MALE:  So -- 

0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Mexico law school is undergrad so I have a GAD from Mexico. 

0:56 0:56 MALE:  Oh okay.  So you've already -- you already spent like -- you're already specialized in law. 

1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  Yes.  It is double law, yes I know [laughter] I'm aware of it. 

1:09 1:10 MALE:  Then why are you here [laughter]? 

1:11 1:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, I don't know.  No, it's okay I like it.  It's very different [unintelligible]. 

1:18 1:19 MALE:  The laws are different? 

1:20 1:22 FEMALE:  The laws are different, yeah they are different, but the professors here at Stanford they are very nice.  I have a professor for my [unintelligible] physicians and economies and mathematicians, you know, and all these guys trying to figuring out what to [unintelligible] to say or not or why to ban abortion or don't, you know, they have all of these policy debates that are very interesting, very interesting.  male206, what's your department? 

1:52 1:53 MALE:  I'm computer science. 

1:53 1:54 FEMALE:  Computer science.  And that's a PhD or a Masters? 

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Masters. 

1:58 1:58 FEMALE:  Masters. 

1:59 1:59  MALE:  It would probably be a good intersection, like if you had someone who knows a lot about law and computer science. 

2:05 2:06 FEMALE:  That would be really cool. 

2:06 2:06 MALE:  You can do a lot. 

2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  Yes and you are going to meet [unintelligible] and she's a very good lawyer in IP and technology. 

2:14 2:15 MALE:  Yeah. 

2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  Yeah. 

2:16 2:17 MALE:  I mean I feel like I should know some of that stuff just so I don't do any -- make any mistakes, you know? 

2:22 2:23 FEMALE:  Yes or this is just [unintelligible] frugal will make who will tell you how to do it for free and won't charge you. 

2:28 2:29 MALE:  Yeah right, that would be very useful for me.  No, but I'm afraid I'll end up like telling somebody, the company secret I wasn't supposed to say.  [laughter] 

2:36 2:38 FEMALE:  Don't worry, but even if you know their rules, there would be another lawyer on the other side finding a way to say that you weren't supposed to say that.  They have a pretty good program in technology [unintelligible]. 

2:49 2:50 MALE:  Here you mean?  Yeah I imagine.  Yeah. 

2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  But I'm not one those [unintelligible].  I'm sorry to say it. 

2:57 2:58 MALE:  But seriously, what's your area? 

3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  Constitutional law I guess. 

3:02 3:03 MALE:  All right, cool. 

3:04 3:05 FEMALE:  But maybe it's [unintelligible]. 

3:05 3:06 MALE:  What? 

3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  You [unintelligible] not ready for that. 

3:07 3:08 MALE:  I don't know, I mean everyone needs to know like their lawyer. 

3:10 3:13 FEMALE:  [laughter] your constitutional rights [laughter] basic, that's more important than technology. 

3:16 3:18 MALE: I don't know. 

3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  Yeah me neither.  [laughter] no I always thought of jumping to technology, but never actually did. 

3:26 3:27 MALE:  Are you living on campus? 

3:28 3:28 FEMALE:  I am living on campus? 

3:29 3:29 MALE:  Where? 

3:30 3:31 FEMALE:  In the studios. 

3:31 3:32 MALE:  All right, cool.  I'm in Rains. 

3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  I'm in [unintelligible] I applied. Well I don't know where I'm next year living. 

3:37 3:37 MALE:  Oh next year you just did the draw, cool. 

3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  My second option was Rains.  I like it.  It is not very expensive and -- well they have, you always have great parties.  Every time I go to a party it's like on my way I find out these four parties going on, so I went to [unintelligible] and there were not even the party that I was going to. 

4:00 4:01 MALE:  Every weekend there's a couple I guess.  I've never been to any of them actually, but they were there.  Okay.  I guess I have to get going.  It was nice meeting you. 

4:12 4:13 FEMALE:  Okay male206, nice to meet you.  Thank you male206. 

4:14 4:15 MALE:  Bye.
