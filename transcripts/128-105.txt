0:11 0:11 MALE:  Hi.
0:07 0:08 FEMALE:  Hey, I'm female128.
0:13 0:13 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].  
0:09 0:09 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:15 0:18 MALE:  I'm trying a new thing.  What's your favorite color?  I'm not going to ask what your major is.
0:13 0:19 FEMALE:  Oh, good.  I don't know if I could talk about anything besides what I do at Stanford.  Uhm, blue.
0:27 0:29 MALE:  Blue.  Blue or green, but mostly blue.  
0:25 0:27 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]
0:32 0:33 MALE:  And I'm wearing a green shirt.  
0:28 0:32 FEMALE:  And blue pants.  I'm wearing like auburn and [unintelligible].
0:37 0:43 MALE:  And if I kind of look at my wardrobe, it's either blue, green, with a few black things.  So...
0:40 0:51 FEMALE:  I would say my wardrobe is mostly blue/blue.  I have some green, some red, maybe a couple of red things and then a couple of [unintelligible], but lots of black.  
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Black's the top.
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  No, the top is blue.
1:01 1:01 MALE:  Blue?
0:56 1:00 FEMALE:  It's like navy blue [unintelligible]. 
1:04 1:04 MALE: Yeah.  
1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  Like [unintelligible].
1:06 1:10 MALE:  Yeah, definitely.  When you compare it to the jeans, it's kind of black.  If you compare it to the other--
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
1:11 1:21 MALE:  Yeah, most of the stuff that I own that is not those colors, is stuff that my sister has given me or friends have given me so it's okay.  
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  What's your favorite animal?
1:23 1:33 MALE:  Favorite animal, lion, or a puppy.  As far as animals that I can have a puppy.  Animals that I think are really cool, lions.  
1:28 1:33 FEMALE:  [laughter]  But not when they're full grown?  Like you don't like dogs just puppies?  
1:38 1:41 MALE:  Oh, no--dogs.  I used to have a dog. 
1:36 1:39 FEMALE:  If they pass the year [unintelligible].  What kind of dog?
1:45 1:46 MALE:  I had a mutt.  
1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  Okay.
1:47 1:52 MALE:  So, it was mostly German Shepherd with a little Akita and a little Pit Bull.  
1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  I don't know what the Akita is.
1:52 1:59 MALE:  It's a little Japanese dog.  So, it kind of looks like one of the shepherds but smaller, short hair.  
1:55 1:55 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:01 2:08 MALE:  And I don't know anything other about it except that I went to the vet.  They said he had some in him, and I saw a picture.  And that's all I know.
2:03 2:05 FEMALE:  Did he look like an Akita at all?  
2:10 2:23 MALE:  He was about that size. He wasn't very big.  He was about that tall and about that big.  He was fun, and then before that I had a German Shepherd, and she was really nice.  What about you?  
2:18 2:22 FEMALE:  I have never had a dog.  I have always wanted one, but I wasn't allowed.
2:27 2:29 MALE:  Ah, did you ever have any pets?  
2:25 2:47 FEMALE:  Uhm, I had fish.  So, we had fish, and we had a hamster.  And the fish [unintelligible], and now we have no fish.  And then we had a hamster, and the hamster crawled into the dishwasher.  And so we have no hamster.  So, I think after that my parents decided that we weren't allowed to have pets anymore.  
2:54 3:11 MALE:  Oh my, I was living with my roommates, and this traumatized my roommate to no end.  So, my roommate had a cat, and we were all watching TV and my roommate was doing laundry.  And all of the sudden we hear [meow], [thump], [meow]. 
3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  Oh, my gosh.
3:13 3:33 MALE:  The cat had jumped into the drier.  [laughter]  And my roommate didn't even notice until my other roommate and I were going, what [unintelligible] is that?  Like, we'd turn off the TV, and it goes on for a little bit.  We're just sitting there, and then my other roommate, the one who owns the cat, pales out. 
3:28 3:28 FEMALE:  Oh, my [unintelligible].  
3:33 3:53 MALE:  What happened?  He opens the door, and the cat runs out.  We didn't see the cat for three days.  [laughter]  We were trying really hard to be supportive.  We were on the floor laughing.  The cat was fine, but, oh.
3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  That's really funny.  
3:54 3:59 MALE:  Yeah, we didn't let my roommate live it down for almost a month.  
3:54 3:56 FEMALE:  Yeah, and and he has nightmares.  
4:02 4:11 MALE:  Well, we didn't--it would have been mortifying if I had had anything [unintelligible], but we weren't--nice talking to you.
