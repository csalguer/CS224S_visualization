0:04 0:04 MALE: Hi.  How are you? [laughter].
0:05 0:07 FEMALE: [unintelligible].  How are you [laughter]?  I'm female327.
0:08 0:08 MALE: I'm male317 [phonetic].
0:08 0:09 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:10 0:10 MALE: You too.  So, uh--
0:10 0:12 FEMALE: How's it going for you today [laughter]?
0:13 0:14 MALE: It's been rushed [laughter].
0:14 0:18 FEMALE: I know.  I'm like good lord, these questionnaires, you know?
0:18 0:20 MALE: That's right.  I can't think this fast, you know?
0:20 0:21 FEMALE: I know.  
0:21 0:21 MALE: I always have to ponder.
0:22 0:23 FEMALE: My prophecies just don't work like that.
0:24 0:25 MALE: Is it a six or is it a seven?
0:26 0:27 FEMALE: I'm just like, what do I really think about this [laughter]?  
0:29 0:30 MALE: That's right [laughter].
0:30 0:34 FEMALE: I want to really mull it over [unintelligible] as you possibly can.
0:34 0:35 MALE:  Yeah.  'Cause they're going to get this.   
0:36 0:36 FEMALE: I know [laughter].
0:37 0:40 MALE: They're going to get someone who's date [unintelligible] and be like, oh, he thought I wasn't friendly. What was he thinking?
0:42 0:48 FEMALE: [laughter] Oh my goodness, seriously.  So are you student here in Stanford or?
0:48 0:51 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  Doing my PhD in electrical engineering.
0:51 0:52 FEMALE: Cool.
0:52 0:52 MALE: And uh--
0:53 0:58 FEMALE: Is it your initial years here?  Or are you into your latter years?
0:58 0:59 MALE: I'm in my older age [laughter].
1:00 1:01 FEMALE: Oh me too.  You're in good company [laughter].
1:02 1:05 MALE: Oh [unintelligible] good.  I probably have the seniority on you, though.  I've been here forever.
1:06 1:12 FEMALE: Yeah.  I kind of feel like that.  But you know, different people have different perceptions of what forever means.  So.
1:13 1:13 MALE: Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.
1:14 1:14 FEMALE: This is my fourth year here.
1:15 1:15 MALE: Fourth year?
1:15 1:16 FEMALE: I'll just come out and say it.
1:17 1:17 MALE: Oh okay
1:18 1:18 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:18 1:18 MALE: Oh my god.
1:21 1:21 FEMALE: [laughter] See that?
1:21 1:25 MALE: I'm not telling you.  I'm not telling.  I've been here longer than that. I'm just not telling you at all.
1:26 1:30 FEMALE: Okay.  You know, you're just taking the scenic route, enjoying things.
1:30 1:32 MALE: What's your, what's your major?  What do you do?
1:32 1:34 FEMALE: I study psychology in the school of education.
1:34 1:36 MALE: I knew it was.  I knew it.  I knew it.
1:36 1:36 FEMALE: How did you know that?
1:38 1:38 MALE: Because [unintelligible] my problems to you [laughter].
1:41 1:43 FEMALE: You are going to tell me everything [laughter].
1:44 1:46 MALE: Let me tell you how many years I've been here, you know.  You won't judge me.
1:47 1:48 FEMALE: I won't judge you.
1:49 1:52 MALE: [unintelligible].  That's interesting.  How long have you been doing that [laughter]? 
1:56 1:56 FEMALE: Too funny.
1:57 1:58 MALE: So psychology in education.
2:00 2:00 FEMALE: That's right.
2:00 2:01 MALE: Yeah?
2:01 2:02 FEMALE: It's been good so far.
2:03 2:03 MALE: Okay.
2:04 2:18 FEMALE: Yeah, I can't complain.  I have been doing this for some years now.  The reason I'm saying it feels like it's been forever is because I was in graduate school before I came here.  So I'm doing all that kind of stuff just to add to the years--
2:19 2:19 MALE: Yeah, that's right.
2:20 2:24 FEMALE: --you know, to more like, though I hesitate to say [laughter].
2:25 2:27 MALE: You don't have to because I've got you, I've got you beat on this stuff.
2:27 2:39 FEMALE: I don't think so.  With all my years of graduate school, it will probably be like--I'd be into my seventh year now.  All right, now you have to say, what year are you?
2:39 2:40 MALE: [laughter] I'm just not going to say [laughter].
2:41 2:44 FEMALE: You're like, I don't need to disclose that information.
2:44 2:56 MALE: The more you say it, and the more embarrassed you sound by that small number of years, the worse I feel.  So we'll just go on to the next topic.  What do you like to do in your spare time [laughter]?  You know, as you get to know me better, then I'll let you know.
2:56 3:05 FEMALE: Good question, too.  Um, I enjoy doing all sorts of random things in my spare time, you know, when I can find it. But you know how graduate life is like, you know.
3:05 3:05 MALE: It's not much, huh?
3:05 3:12 FEMALE: You fit in things that you really need to and want to, so.  I really kind of need some balance, right?  So.
3:12 3:12 MALE: [laughter] Yeah.  That's right.
3:12 3:15 FEMALE: Uh, I actually sing with a group here on campus.
3:16 3:16 MALE: You do?
3:17 3:22 FEMALE: And you know, that kind of keeps me engaged in something outside of my own research and the projects I work on and stuff.
3:23 3:23 MALE: Really?  Okay.
3:25 3:27 FEMALE: It's fun.  And you know, I've kind of been singing all my life.
3:28 3:28 MALE: Cool.
3:28 3:36 FEMALE: And so, I enjoy music in general.  I enjoy a good read, although I haven't done that in a long time, outside of like academic kind of reading, you know.  Um--
3:36 3:41 MALE: You're a very--much more relaxed person than the other people I've been meeting tonight.
3:41 3:41 FEMALE: Really?
3:43 3:43 MALE: You talk more slowly and you seem to have-- 
3:44 3:50 FEMALE: Oh yeah.  You know, I've been told this before.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just like this too laid back kind of--
3:51 3:51 MALE: Calm demeanor.
3:51 3:53 FEMALE: --California demeanor is going here.  I don't know.
3:54 3:55 MALE: Did you grow up in California?
3:56 3:56 FEMALE: No.  I grew up in New York, actually.
3:57 4:01 MALE: You shouldn't be talking this way [laughter].  What's wrong with you?
4:01 4:03 FEMALE: Whenever I tell people I'm from New York, they're like, seriously?
4:04 4:07 MALE: You found [unintelligible] your population here.  This is your home.
4:07 4:08 FEMALE: A new home, seriously. 
4:09 4:09 MALE: Well nice meeting you.
4:09 4:13 FEMALE: It was very nice meeting you as well [laughter].  Good luck finishing out the year.
4:14 4:15 MALE: Yeah, there we go.  Thanks.
4:15 4:15 FEMALE: Take care.
