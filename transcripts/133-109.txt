0:26 0:26 MALE:  [interposing]  Have you?  
0:27 0:35 FEMALE:  Once, yeah, I went to Wayman's speed dating, but what I notice is at the beginning [unintelligible] energy is very, very high.  
0:35 0:38 MALE:  But at the end you just sort of get in a [unintelligible].  
0:40 0:40 FEMALE:  Let go.  
0:40 0:47 MALE:  As with most things, right.  In the beginning we are like full of energy, and then we just want to get it over with.  So, what school are you in?  
0:49 0:50 FEMALE:  I study economics.  
0:49 0:54 MALE:  Oh, economics.  Economics is not in the business here right, or is it?  
0:55 0:57 FEMALE:  Some of it is.  They have an economics department. 
0:56 1:00 MALE:  Oh, they have an economics department, okay.  So you are doing PhD right now?  
1:01 1:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:00 1:06 MALE:  I see.  What makes you want to do economics?  I'm engineering.  
1:07 1:15 FEMALE: Okay.  I guess [unintelligible], and I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do.  And it seemed like at least the middle as far as taking a [unintelligible].  [laughter]  
1:15 1:17 MALE:  I see.  What makes you think I should use [unintelligible]?  
1:19 1:19 FEMALE:  What?  
1:19 1:20 MALE: What makes you think it's the least committal?  
1:21 1:38 FEMALE:  Well, or at least before you're a PhD, at least in college you can like--you know, [unintelligible] political science, kind of math, kind of public policy, kind of all of the things [unintelligible].  So, what do you like about [unintelligible] study a lot of things and how [unintelligible].  
1:38 1:40 MALE:  Oh, I see, interesting.  
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  So, you do engineering?  
1:41 1:42 MALE:  I'm in electrical engineering.  
1:44 1:46 FEMALE: And do you like it?  
1:46 1:46 MALE: Second-year [unintelligible].  
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Second?  
1:48 1:59 MALE:  Yeah, before this I was not in engineering.  I did math for undergrad, but I realized that I'm not as [unintelligible] as my passion is.  So, I decided to do engineering.  
2:00 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, I did math too, but it wasn't--kind of a [unintelligible].  
2:06 2:12 MALE:  Oh, I see.  So, what's you think that--your degree in undergrad?  
2:14 2:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, I [unintelligible], but it--like biology because math and [unintelligible].  
2:18 2:19 MALE:  Oh, you did triple major?  
2:20 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, I can't decide anything.  
2:21 2:25 MALE:  Wow.  Interesting.  How long did it take you to complete your undergrad?  
2:28 2:33 FEMALE:  I did it in four years.  I was done in three, but I went to London for a year.  
2:32 2:33 MALE:  Oh, in London.  
2:35 2:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, I [unintelligible].  
2:37 2:39 MALE:  Which school in London were you at?  
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]
2:41 2:46 MALE:  Wow.  I think studying abroad makes a person more well rounded.  
2:48 3:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, and we--it was good.  The unfortunate thing was I had to go my senior.  So, I really wished I had worked there the whole time.  But it was still curious [unintelligible] in the U.S. they don't really put as much math and [unintelligible] typically.  But then you go abroad and they [unintelligible].  
3:06 3:12 MALE:  So, what do you plan for your degree from Stanford, or do you want to go to economics?  
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  Third-year?  
3:14 3:15 MALE:  What year are you?
3:16 3:18 FEMALE:  It's second, yeah.  
3:16 3:16 MALE:  Oh, second.  
3:19 3:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'd like to be a professor, but I don't really know what topic.  If not, I'll [unintelligible] because I mentioned to an industrial organizations and [unintelligible] processing.  [crosstalk]
3:32 3:34 MALE:  Oh, antitrust.  Did you say antitrust?
3:35 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah, antitrust. 
3:36 3:37 MALE:  That's related to [unintelligible], then.  
3:39 3:42 FEMALE:  Right.  They [unintelligible] industrial organizations around [unintelligible].  
3:42 3:51 MALE:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, I took an [unintelligible] psychology class as undergrad, and I think it's part of the most interesting class outside of engineering that I took.  
3:52 3:54 FEMALE:  Right.  What did they talk about?  
3:55 4:02 MALE:  Employee behavior in the workplace.  [laughter] Those are obviously related to antitrust but something different.  It was nice meeting you, female133.  
4:04 4:05 FEMALE:  Nice meeting you too.
