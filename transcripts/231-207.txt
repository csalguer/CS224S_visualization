0:00 0:00 MALE: No talking.  Shh.

0:03 0:05 FEMALE: At Stanford we all follow rules.

0:03 0:05 MALE: [unintelligible].

0:08 0:14 FEMALE: It's nice to have a little corner.  If it gets really bad I can just leave, no one will ever know.  Yeah.  It's been okay so far.

0:08 0:09 MALE: I'm male207.

0:17 0:19 FEMALE: I'm female231.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  [horn] 

0:10 0:12 MALE: Good to meet you.  There we go.

0:19 0:21 FEMALE: Horrible sound.

0:12 0:14 MALE: Now we can officially start [laughter].

0:22 0:23 FEMALE: I know, now we can actually talk.

0:15 0:16 MALE: Yeah.

0:24 0:28 FEMALE: So I've yet to come up with a good interesting lead question.

0:20 0:23 MALE: You'll warm up, you know.  You ever done this before?

0:31 0:32 FEMALE: I haven't actually, this is my first time.

0:24 0:26 MALE: So I did this at Rains.

0:34 0:35 FEMALE: Okay.  

0:27 0:28 MALE: Earlier in the year.

0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  

0:28 0:33 MALE: And toward the end I was doing this thing where I was finding out what the people in front of me were saying and then, like, making jokes on what they were saying.

0:41 0:42 FEMALE: Oh really?

0:34 0:36 MALE: Like, most people kind of say the same things to people, so I just.

0:44 0:45 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:37 0:38 MALE: Yeah.  

0:45 0:48 FEMALE: So you start to rip on that.  Fair enough.  So do you live in Rains?

0:40 0:41 MALE: I do.

0:49 0:50 FEMALE: Okay.  I live in Rains.

0:41 0:42 MALE: Oh yeah?

0:50 0:52 FEMALE: Yeah.  Two of my roommates are--that's actually my roommate you just talked to.

0:44 0:45 MALE: nameX?

0:53 0:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:46 0:48 MALE: So what [unintelligible]?

0:56 0:58 FEMALE: I'm in 226.

0:50 0:51 MALE: Okay.  29.

0:59 1:03 FEMALE: Okay.  Also on the other side of Hill Court you must be, so.

0:52 0:58 MALE: Right around the corner.  Yeah.  Yes.  Do you like Rains?

1:06 1:13 FEMALE: Yeah.  I like it fine.  I actually--this is my first year at Stanford, and I had actually preffed it because they had a volleyball court, which I have yet to actually go use, but--

1:05 1:06 MALE: There are people that are out there pretty often.

1:14 1:20 FEMALE: I know.  I actually joined an intramural volleyball team, and apparently everybody else on the team knows each other because they all play on the same courts together.

1:11 1:13 MALE: Okay.  You joined the Rains one?

1:21 1:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:14 1:15 MALE: Okay cool.

1:22 1:23 FEMALE: Are you playing with them?

1:15 1:16 MALE: No.

1:23 1:24 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:16 1:17 MALE: But my roommate does, nameX, English guy?

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Oh yeah.

1:18 1:20 MALE: British guy?  Yeah.    

1:28 1:29 FEMALE: Yeah.  He, he and I play the same night, Wednesday night.

1:21 1:23 MALE: Yeah, fair enough.  That's right.

1:31 1:32 FEMALE: So are you an engineer?

1:24 1:25 MALE: I am.  

1:33 1:34 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:25 1:26 MALE: How'd you know?

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Shot in the dark.

1:27 1:28 MALE: Yeah, there you go.  Electrical.

1:36 1:37 FEMALE: I figure it's an easy risk.

1:29 1:30 MALE: Yeah.  I'm electrical, PhD.

1:38 1:40 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Which year are you in?

1:32 1:33 MALE: Third.

1:41 1:42 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:33 1:34 MALE: Hate to admit it.

1:42 1:43 FEMALE: Why is that bad?

1:34 1:40 MALE: I can't believe next year--because I mean, it just seems weird to, like, been in grad school for so long.  I don't know, I mean I guess--

1:48 1:52 FEMALE: I think if you're doing a PhD, you're probably going to be around at least for three years, right?

1:44 1:46 MALE: Oh it's more than that.

1:54 1:55 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:47 1:50 MALE: Probably five, maybe [unintelligible].

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Is that what it is, usually, for engineers?

1:51 2:00 MALE: It really depends.  Um I, not, no, none of the electrical engineers that I know get out in less than five, but, but that's also because--

2:08 2:12 FEMALE: So I see you said none of the electrical engineers I know get out, and then you paused.  And I'm like, [laughter] 

2:04 2:05 MALE: [laughter] Ever.

2:12 2:14 FEMALE: I don't think I asked that question.  

2:07 2:08 MALE: Um, get out much.

2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Sorry, get out in less than five.

2:11 2:20 MALE: Um yes.  Um I think it's uh--I think, like, we have pretty high course loads though, so.  What are you--?

2:28 2:29 FEMALE: Okay.  So are you still taking courses then?

2:21 2:26 MALE: I'm--this quarter I actually almost finished.  I have one more after this.  Pretty good.

2:34 2:35 FEMALE: Good.  Um I'm in communication.

2:27 2:28 MALE: Okay.  

2:36 2:38 FEMALE: Department of communication, I say political communication.

2:30 2:31 MALE: Okay.  Cool.

2:39 2:41 FEMALE: So and I, I'm a, I'm a brand new, first year.

2:33 2:35 MALE: Tell me more about this, what is political communication?

2:43 2:45 FEMALE: More about communication, what does that mean?  

2:35 2:36 MALE: Propaganda?

2:45 2:48 FEMALE: Uh a little bit.  It actually started in propaganda settings.

2:39 2:40 MALE: Okay.  

2:48 2:53 FEMALE: So communication departments are pretty young.  Um Stanford's actually one of the oldest and it was founded in the fifties.

2:45 2:46 MALE: Okay.  

2:53 2:59 FEMALE: Uh and some of the earliest sort of communication studies came out of propaganda studies or focus group studies, sort of, you know, with marketing and things like that.

2:51 2:52 MALE: Right.

3:00 3:05 FEMALE: Um our, our sort of areas that are strong are political communication and human-computer interaction.

2:57 2:58 MALE: Okay.  

3:06 3:08 FEMALE: So, like interface design and testing and things like that.

2:58 3:00 MALE: Cool, yeah.  I know all about HCI

3:08 3:12 FEMALE: Yeah.  So those are what we do.  I'm on the poli com side of things.

3:04 3:06 MALE: Okay.  So what, what's your specific interest?

3:14 3:18 FEMALE: My specific interest is how young people become engaged with political activity.

3:11 3:13 MALE: Not enough.  Is the answer, right?

3:20 3:24 FEMALE: Not enough, that's true.  Well, I mean, that's a judgment but I agree with that judgment.  

3:16 3:17 MALE: Okay.  

3:25 3:34 FEMALE: Uh, you know, there was this big hype that more, more youth were going to be involved with this past election, which by most measures they were, but everybody was, so--

3:26 3:30 MALE: Right.  In numbers, in numbers they grew but in percentage wise they've not.

3:38 3:43 FEMALE: Yeah.  So uh I don't know.  I think there's some interesting stuff.  I also have a particular thing for the internet--

3:35 3:37 MALE:  Okay.  Cool.

3:43 3:48 FEMALE:  and new media and whether or not there's some way that that can engage people who haven't been engaged and--

3:40 3:41 MALE: Yeah.  

3:49 3:50 FEMALE: So.

3:41 3:42 MALE: Seemed to work for Dean, huh?

3:51 3:53 FEMALE: My roommate actually works for Dean.  I moved from DC here.

3:45 3:46 MALE: Okay.  Oh, I'm from [unintelligible] Virginia.

3:54 3:55 FEMALE: Oh really?

3:47 3:48 MALE: Yeah.  

3:56 3:59 FEMALE: Oh okay.  Yeah.  I lived in uh, I lived in Adams Morgan for a while.

3:51 3:52 MALE: Okay.  

3:59 4:02 FEMALE: And then I lived in, uh Crystal City just next to the airport.

3:54 4:01 MALE: Yep.  My parents are actually moving from the house to an apartment, to, like, a condo in [unintelligible].

4:08 4:09 FEMALE: Oh okay.

4:01 4:02 MALE: Yeah.  

4:10 4:12 FEMALE: So when did you come here then?  Three years ago.

4:04 4:05 MALE: Yes.

4:13 4:14 FEMALE: And where had you been before that?

4:06 4:07 MALE: Princeton.

4:15 4:16 FEMALE: Oh really?

4:07 4:08 MALE: Yeah.  

4:16 4:17 FEMALE: Okay.  When did you graduate from there?

4:09 4:10 MALE: '02.

4:18 4:23 FEMALE: Who do I know who graduated in '02?  [horn] I don't think anybody.  I may have to think about that.

4:15 4:17 MALE: Yeah.  If you think of anyone, let me know.

4:25 4:26 FEMALE: I think that's it.  

4:19 4:21 MALE: Was that the real blow?  That was the real whistle?

4:28 4:30 FEMALE: It's nice meeting you, absolutely.

4:21 4:23 MALE: Good to meet you.  Sorry it was so short.
