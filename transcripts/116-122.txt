0:01 0:02 MALE:  So were you at the Biomasting [phonetic] today?
0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04 0:10 MALE:  I don't know anybody there, but I was going to get a free burrito and Java juice and just kind of like hangout for a minute, and it was gone.
0:10 0:13 FEMALE:  I know.  I got there 10 minutes late and there was nothing left.
0:14 0:15 MALE:  What time, so you got there like at 5:10?
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:16 0:17 MALE:  And there was nothing?
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  No.
0:18 0:20 MALE:  I got there about 5:20 and I thought --
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  Supposedly it was all gone by 5:30.
0:22 0:25 MALE:  That's frustrating.  That's not cool actually.
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:27 0:48 MALE:  I didn't really like, I mean they advertise it being open to everyone, but I still call it the little bad.  But Java juice and burritos are pretty good.  And once in awhile I've gone and gotten stuff and I've known someone or whatever, but I don't know.  Like I guess I don't know.  It was just like [unintelligible], I'm sure you saw it.  And even like the [unintelligible] were gone.
0:48 0:50 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
0:52 0:55 MALE:  I saw people still eating their burritos, too, and they don't have anymore.
0:59 1:02 FEMALE:  So I'm impressed by your memory.  So you're not here pulling my shirt.
1:05 1:06 MALE:  You worry not.  You were driving.
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, you were behind me so I didn't see you.
1:10 1:14 MALE:  Exactly.  So I can't remember.  Are you in Engineering?
1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  I'm with Genetics.
1:15 1:16 MALE:  Oh, that's right.  Okay.
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  I'm [unintelligible].
1:19 1:20 MALE:  Oh, I'm sorry.  [unintelligible].
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Right.
1:22 1:25 MALE:  Have you done anymore club stuff?
1:25 1:26 FEMALE:  No.  Have you?
1:27 1:44 MALE:  Actually no.  But I am doing some biking and stuff.  But I just want to go and it's beautiful every weekend, but like my work is really killing me.  So I feel like if I went, then I'd just be worried about work.  You know I don't know.  Are you doing other stuff or is it work?
1:45 1:49 FEMALE:  It's classes and a little bit of lab work.  I'm not too busy right now actually.
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Really?
1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  It's really nice because it's nice weather finally.
1:53 1:53 MALE:  It's been awesome.
1:54 1:57 FEMALE:  So I don't know what I'm going to do this weekend.  I know its something outside.
1:57 2:19 MALE:  There's like an all day hike on Sunday is looking really good.  I think it's pretty hard.  I think a lot of climbing.  It could be good, though.  I'm thinking about going.  If I could be really productive, then I'd probably go.  So what are your plans for the summer?  Are you going to work here?
2:20 2:29 FEMALE:  So the programs expect you to be in lab all summer.  So I can take a couple weeks vacation.  I'm not sure where that will be yet, but [unintelligible].
2:30 2:31 MALE:  You might as well man.
2:31 2:36 FEMALE:  I know, but I'm not sure yet.  I want to visit my friends up in Washington.
2:37 2:38 MALE:  So you're not going to go back to Colorado?
2:38 2:44 FEMALE:  I was there last summer.  I'm there for Christmas.  My parents have already been out twice to see me out here.
2:44 2:45 MALE:  Twice this year?
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:47 2:47 MALE:  Oh wow.
2:47 2:50 FEMALE:  For different reasons, but [unintelligible].
2:50 2:51 MALE:  You've gotten a good dose.
2:51 2:53 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] you come to California.
2:53 2:54 MALE:  You've gotten a good dose of it.
2:56 3:03 FEMALE:  My brother came, too, for Spring Break.  [unintelligible].
3:03 3:04 MALE:  It's like mine.  It's not very exciting.
3:06 3:06 FEMALE:  Very calm.
3:08 3:15 MALE:  Actually I found out that some people in Range have like potential bigger rooms than me in Range, which is kind of a bummer.
3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, mine's not big.
3:17 3:34 MALE:  I was always assuming that everyone had the same small room.  My friend, nameX, is like not a queen bed.  What's the one that's just smaller than a queen?  Anyway, a big bed.  A big bed, but not like a small one.  And he's still got like a lot of room.
3:35 3:40 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:40 3:42 MALE:  You'd be like up against the wall.
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:44 3:55 MALE:  I'm really glad that you said the burritos, not for [unintelligible], but like it was gone.  I didn't miss it by just a minute.  Engineers, they strike fast.
3:56 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, well I think they were all gearing up even before that.
4:01 4:02 MALE:  Like 4:55?
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  Or before, yeah.
4:05 4:05 MALE:  See you later.
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  See ya.
