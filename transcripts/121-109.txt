0:02 0:02 FEMALE: Hi there.

0:07 0:07 MALE: Hello.

0:02 0:04 FEMALE: I'm being a little slow, sorry.

0:09 0:11 MALE: Don't worry.  Take your time.

0:06 0:06 FEMALE: [laughter] 

0:11 0:12 MALE: Get some thoughts.

0:07 0:20 FEMALE: [laughter] It's hard.  Okay.  Hi.

0:26 0:26 MALE: Hi.

0:21 0:22 FEMALE: I'm female121.

0:27 0:27 MALE: I'm male109.

0:22 0:23 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

0:28 0:28 MALE: You too.

0:24 0:25 FEMALE: Are you having fun?

0:31 0:32 MALE: Yes I am.  What about you?

0:26 0:31 FEMALE: Good, yeah.  I didn't know what to expect at all.

0:37 0:38 MALE: Have you ever done this before?

0:33 0:34 FEMALE: No, have you?

0:38 0:41 MALE: Yeah, yeah, I've never done this before.  Have you heard about it before?

0:36 0:41 FEMALE: I mean, I think probably in passing but I never actually really thought very much about it so--  Want some water?

0:48 0:48 MALE: Sure, thanks Ono [phonetic].

0:44 0:55 FEMALE: Sure.  Thanks Ono.  Um, yeah and the professor who is running it, I'm taking one of his classes this quarter so he was handing out the forms in class.

1:00 1:01 MALE: nameX, nameX?

0:56 1:03 FEMALE: nameX [phonetic] nameX, yeah, so we were the first ones to sort of get the nudge to come.  [laughter] 

1:09 1:15 MALE: Uh, what's the motivation for him to do this for like--how does it relate to educational research?

1:10 1:16 FEMALE: He does um, from what I understand he does um, higher education.  He's also a sociologist so it's sort of a--

1:21 1:21 MALE: Ah, a sociologist.

1:17 1:29 FEMALE: So it's a crossover.  And he studies higher ed and sort of social networking in the higher ed sphere.  So this is just part of it, like a lot of stuff with how groups interact, and so this is just sort of one component of it, I guess.

1:35 1:37 MALE: I see.  So uh, what's your focus in education?

1:33 1:37 FEMALE: I'm doing a masters in policy, organization, and leadership studies.

1:41 1:43 MALE: That's a brand new program, right?

1:38 1:40 FEMALE: It is a brand new program.  How do you know about it?  What are you in?

1:46 1:47 MALE: Oh I'm in electrical engineering.

1:42 1:42 FEMALE: Okay.

1:48 1:49 MALE: So I just heard about it before.

1:44 1:45 FEMALE: Really?

1:52 1:52 MALE: This is the first-last year was the first year ever, right?

1:47 1:48 FEMALE: This is the first year.

1:53 1:54 MALE: Oh this is the first year.

1:49 1:50 FEMALE: Uh huh, uh huh.

1:55 1:57 MALE: So last fall was the first year, right?

1:52 1:54 FEMALE: Exactly.  And we're the first class passing through.

2:00 2:03 MALE: So how do you find the program?  So you guys are like the guinea pigs.

1:58 2:13 FEMALE: We are the guinea pigs.  It's been a little bumpy because it's new and they are sorting through some stuff but it's also really um, helpful to be the first class because they're a little more flexible when things don't work and we can get them to be more responsive to what we want.

2:18 2:21 MALE: It's not as rigid as an established program, right?

2:17 2:30 FEMALE: Right, right, so but they put a lot of thought into it before we got here so it's not like totally out of the blue but it definitely, some of the logistics were [laughter] it was a real lack of vision.  [laughter] 

2:36 2:41 MALE: Is your background in education before you uh, you decided to do this or--

2:36 2:48 FEMALE: Yeah, I um, I worked for a company in New York City called Edison Schools, which is a for profit manager of public schools.  So it works with public schools that are failing to help them to their jobs better.

2:54 2:57 MALE: Oh, try to recover schools through management?

2:52 2:55 FEMALE: Through management, yeah.  So it's a management company and um--

3:00 3:02 MALE: It's just like uh, private equity but for schools.

2:58 3:07 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter]  Yeah, it causes a lot of trouble because it's working with public schools and people get very threatened by a private company working with public schools but they do a good job.

3:12 3:16 MALE: So have the results been quite successful or phenomenal?

3:12 3:26 FEMALE: They've been mixed there.  I mean, it's not the answer for everybody so some schools really respond very well to it and some schools don't, just like any programs.  So there are times when it hasn't worked as well and it's sad when that happens but it's very--a reality of the school so--

3:31 3:40 MALE: So uh, so do they put consultants to the school or they basically put managers to the school?  Or like, how does that work?  I mean, besides to work, like have a deal with the school?

3:35 3:36 FEMALE: Right, um--

3:41 3:42 MALE: What's the arrangement?

3:37 4:05 FEMALE: It depends on the school and what the district is willing to let happen, and also what the teacher's union is willing to let happen because they often have a lot of control over the contract.  So sometimes there are areas that we're not-they-that they're not allowed to be engaged in.  It's generally whole management so they train all the teachers, they hire a new principal, they bring in their own curriculum, everything.  They run the budgets, they do everything.

4:10 4:13 MALE: Yeah, that's the first time I ever have heard of that thing.  That was quite interesting.

4:07 4:08 FEMALE: Fascinating, right?

4:13 4:13 MALE: Fascinating.

4:09 4:11 FEMALE: It's something new.  Nice to meet you.

4:17 4:17 MALE: Nice meeting you.

4:12 4:13 FEMALE: Have fun.

4:18 4:18 MALE: You too.
