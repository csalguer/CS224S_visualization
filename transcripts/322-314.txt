0:00:10.2  0:00:10.2  MALE:  Hi 
0:00:02.1  0:00:02.2  FEMALE:  Hi [laughter]  
0:00:10.9  0:00:12.9  MALE: I assume you've [unintelligible]. 
0:00:04.4  0:00:05.0  FEMALE:  Huh.
0:00:13.7  0:00:14.8  MALE:  I assume we've never met.
0:00:06.2  0:00:09.3  FEMALE:  Right. Yeah, no.  But I always try for that one too.
0:00:18.0  0:00:20.5  MALE:  We need to, you know, just save all the time we can.  You know the time [unintelligible]
0:00:11.8  0:00:13.3  FEMALE:  [laughter]  exactly, exactly.
0:00:22.0  0:00:23.2  MALE:  So which department are you in?
0:00:14.5  0:00:16.4  FEMALE:  I am in the school of education here.
0:00:25.1  0:00:25.1  MALE:  Okay.  Master?
0:00:16.4  0:00:18.9  FEMALE:  I'm lerning to be a math teacher.  Um-hmm.
0:00:27.6  0:00:29.8  MALE:  Oh nice, where did you go to undergrad?
0:00:21.1  0:00:25.1  FEMALE:  I did my undergrad at Carlton College in Minnesota.  It's really small.
0:00:33.8  0:00:36.3  MALE:  That's one of those liberal arts colleges, right. 
0:00:27.6  0:00:29.8  FEMALE:  Yes it real Liberal arts.
0:00:38.5  0:00:42.6  MALE:  I probabloy should have gone to one of those.  Don't you guys--you get like personal attention and so on, right.  Is that cool? 
0:00:33.9  0:00:37.7  FEMALE:  It's kind of amazing; it's a really good college.  You should have done that.  Where did you end up going?
0:00:46.4  0:00:50.8  MALE: I was one of these lifers.  I started at Sanford and I'm to lazy to leave. I'm getting my PHD [unintelligible].
0:00:42.1  0:00:45.7  FEMALE:  Right, right, oh great.  What are you getting your PH to?
0:00:54.4  0:01:05.0  MALE:  Electrical Engineering, I mean you know Bio X like at the Clark Center down over there, it's got gleaming new stuff.  It's very inpractical, but it looks pretty.  Yeah.  Like I said, that's [unintelligible]. 
0:00:56.3  0:00:56.5  FEMALE: It is called the Clark center?  
0:01:05.2  0:01:06.0  MALE:  Yeah it like--
0:00:57.3  0:00:59.0  FEMALE:  [interposing] I don't think I know where that is.
0:01:07.7  0:01:12.7  MALE:  It's got like new [unintelligible] over there.  I mean, anyways, it's [unintelligible].  So, I do like Bio and [unintelligible].
0:01:04.0  0:01:09.8  FEMALE:  Oh very cool, so what do you do?  What does that mean?
0:01:18.5  0:01:34.6  MALE:  Well, so alright, so you want--all right ten second.  Basically the difference between humans and mice and other organism isn't in which parts there are around there, but how they're connected.  So looking at the connectivity is circuit engineering.  So that's what I look at.  So basically, you know, [unintelligible]. 
0:01:25.9  0:01:30.3  FEMALE:  But how does an electrical engineering play?
0:01:39.0  0:01:56.5  MALE:  So the thing is, the way genes are expressed and which genes are turned on turned--like say they'll give you hair color, eye color, or you know, make something that will metabilize what you're eating. That's all very complicated interconnects and basically circuitry.  So understand these big circuit maps you need double [unintelligible].  So, yeah. 
0:01:47.8  0:01:50.9  FEMALE:  How cool, that is so cool, I am learning a lot today.
0:01:59.6  0:02:11.0  MALE:  [laughter] .  So where are you going to, I mean, I probably should have, you know I like people who more so, you know.  At some point I was thinking, gosh, you don't talk to anybody for like two weeks.  And you're just writing programs anyhow.
0:02:02.3  0:02:03.1  FEMALE:  Right. 
0:02:11.8  0:02:13.9  MALE:  So where are you going to teach after you graduate? 
0:02:05.2  0:02:08.1  FEMALE:  I actually just accepted a job this week at Berkley high.
0:02:16.8  0:02:17.5  MALE:  Oh, really.  Nice. 
0:02:08.8  0:02:15.8  FEMALE:  So I will be at Berkley next year.  I am really interested in math education as you know as a vertical change.
0:02:24.5  0:02:25.9  MALE:  So, that's the right place for you?
0:02:17.2  0:02:26.7  FEMALE: Yes, so that will be good.  There is the whole gamut there and great support.  They've got a wonderful leader in their principal, so I am really excited.
0:02:35.4  0:02:42.1  MALE: You could also--I don't know if you are interested in those kinds of thing--but if you're interested in doing any kind of research like maybe ith Raven's Wood Reads over here.0:02:41.9:02:41.9  FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:42.1  0:02:44.8  MALE: And it's being taken over by Stanford.  I don't know if you heard about that.
0:02:36.1  0:02:36.4  FEMALE:  No, I haven't.
0:02:45.1  0:02:55.1  MALE:  Yes, so, so that department is now going to be affiliated with the school of education.  So, something like that may happen at Berkeley where Berkley line--
0:02:37.7  0:02:39.1  FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh, you are talking about EK High School. 
0:02:56.5  0:02:57.7  MALE:  Yeah.  I mean maybe I'm mistaken about that.
0:02:40.0  0:03:03.3  FEMALE:  No, no, no.   Yes, you are absolutely right it used to be called Raven's Head yeah I know.   We have a couple of people in my program that are placed over there; they are doing their student teaching there.  And so yeah we really tapped in to what's going on over there. 
0:03:12.0  0:03:14.3  MALE:  So, are you in Teach for America or something like that? 
0:03:05.6  0:03:06.4  FEMALE:  No, no, no. 
0:03:15.1  0:03:15.7  MALE:  Have you heard about uni? 
0:03:07.0  0:03:28.2  FEMALE:  Yes, I have heard about that.  I um, I actually had some problems [unintelligible].  But our program here we were here.  We were here for a year, they put us in a class room starting in June and we - you know set all the dorms and by the end with full time teacher.  And having all of the responsibilities of a teacher, calling the homes, giving the grades, you know. 
0:03:36.9  0:03:41.1  MALE:  So is Berkley High kind of like [unintelligible] high?  Like do the professor kids go there?
0:03:32.4  0:03:33.3  FEMALE:  I don't know. 
0:03:42.0  0:03:42.8  MALE:  Yeah.  Okay. 
0:03:34.1  0:03:41.3  FEMALE:   Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um, well about five years ago that wasn't the case.  Even like liberal Berkeley professors--
0:03:50.0  0:03:50.4  MALE:  [interposing] sent their kids to private school. 
0:03:41.7  0:03:49.9  FEMALE:  --were sending in their kids to private school.  They have a new principal over there and he is trying to make a lot of changes and all of the kids have started coming back to the public schools. 
0:03:58.6  0:04:00.0  MALE:  Are you--I'm a public school product.  Are you? 
0:03:51.3  0:03:54.8  FEMALE:  Yeah, me too.  Where are you from initially? 
0:04:03.5  0:04:04.0  MALE:  Um, Long Island. 
0:03:55.3  0:03:55.9  FEMALE:  Oh cool. 
0:04:04.6  0:04:05.6  MALE:  Yeah.  Yourself? 
0:03:56.9  0:03:58.9  FEMALE:  I'm from from around here, from Redwood City. 
0:04:07.6  0:04:10.0  MALE:  Oh so you went from Redwood City to [unintelligible]. 
0:04:01.5  0:04:03.7  FEMALE:  Was in New York for a couple of years. 
0:04:12.4  0:04:15.9  MALE:  Oh, right.  Nice to meet you. 
0:04:07.2  0:04:12.7  FEMALE:  Okay. Nice to meet you.
