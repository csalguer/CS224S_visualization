0:01 0:03 FEMALE: I'm trying to stuff my face with chocolate before the buzzer starts.

0:03 0:16 MALE: I'm just trying to amuse myself.  I'm coming out with my own elevator music while -- while I fill these things out.  [laughter].  Doo-do--doo, doo-do--doo.  

0:17 0:17 FEMALE: female221.

0:17 0:18 MALE: male204.

0:18 0:20 FEMALE: Hi.  Nice firm handshake. 

0:20 0:20 MALE: Yeah.

0:21 0:22 FEMALE: So what do you do?

0:21 0:23 MALE: I'm an electrical engineer.  You? 

0:24 0:25 FEMALE: Uh, Russian literature.

0:25 0:32 MALE: Russian literature.  So like, I'm probably -- not anything I've  ever heard of, so I'm like Tolstoy.

0:32 0:33 FEMALE: Dostoevsky - yeah, Tolstoy.

0:33 0:34 MALE: Dostoevsky.

0:35 0:35 FEMALE: Yeah, there you go.

0:36 0:38 MALE: [laughter].  And then -- well, I assumed you would get rapidly more [extreme] than that, so...

0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Yes.  Yeah, I won't even bother.  

0:40 0:41 MALE: Yeah. [laughter].  

0:42 0:42 FEMALE: What year are you?

0:57 0:58 MALE: I was in the Navy for five years.

0:58 0:58 FEMALE: Really?

0:59 0:59 MALE: Yeah.

0:59 1:00 FEMALE: What did you do?

1:00 1:04 MALE: I was an engineer for the Navy.  I flew a desk.

1:04 1:05 FEMALE: Flew a desk, right.

1:06 1:13 MALE: Yes, yes, I got to pick up the phone and yell at people all day.  So that was the excitement -- the only excitement I got was yelling at other engineers and having them yelling at you.

1:14 1:15 FEMALE: What inspired you to join the Navy?

1:16 1:22 MALE: Um, a lot of things.  First, they paid for college, so...

1:23 1:26 FEMALE: So did you -- is that where you go after college?

1:26 1:26 MALE: Yes, yes.

1:27 1:27 FEMALE: Okay.

1:27 1:30 MALE: So you pay -- they pay you for your schooling.

1:30 1:30 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:31 1:32 MALE: And you owe them four years, at least.

1:32 1:32 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:33 1:35 MALE: And it's the advanced [phonetic] program [unintelligible].

1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Right.

1:36 1:42 MALE: So I paid for college, and that was the initial draw.  I guess I got a full ride.  [laughter].

1:43 1:43 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:44 1:52 MALE: It's not -- you know, it's not much -- a no-brainer.  And also I always had a desire to do service.  And then I watched "The Hunt for Red October," and that [unintelligible].

1:52 1:54 FEMALE: [laughter].  Good effort [phonetic].

1:55 1:57 MALE: So [laughter], you know it's a variety of things, but...

1:58 1:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  Were you -

1:59 2:00 MALE: Have you ever seen "The Hunt for Red October"?

2:00 2:00 FEMALE: Yes, I have.

2:01 2:01 MALE: Great movie.

2:01 2:02 FEMALE: Yeah, it's got Russian stuff in it.

2:03 2:07 MALE: Oh, yeah, they sing -- sing the Russian national anthem, and Jonesy's [phonetic] like, "I hear singing."  [laughter]. 

2:07 2:07 FEMALE: Right, yeah.

2:08 2:11 MALE: [laughter].  Sorry, excuse me.

2:11 2:11 FEMALE: So where are you from originally?

2:12 2:16 MALE: I'm from Washington, D.C., and that's where I spent all five years in the Navy.

2:16 2:16 FEMALE: Okay.

2:17 2:19 MALE: So they -- join the Navy, see the world, send me home.

2:20 2:20 FEMALE: Sweet.

2:20 2:28 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  Actually, it was cool.  It was cool.  I mean it's like -- have you worked at all, like, through college and [unintelligible].

2:28 2:28 FEMALE: Mm.

2:29 2:32 MALE: Yeah, so... working at home, were you in your own home?

2:32 2:33 FEMALE: Yeah, I was home also, yeah.	 

2:34 2:35 MALE: So you know -- were you actually living at home?

2:36 2:38 FEMALE: No, I mean lived in the same city, I was back.

2:39 2:40 MALE: So you know exactly what happens [phonetic].

2:40 2:47 FEMALE: It was really nice, I really liked it.  It felt very, like, real-lifey, you know?  And I could spend time with my Mom and, you know, yeah.

2:47 2:49 MALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I had dinner and stuff like that.

2:50 2:50 FEMALE: Mm-hmm, yeah.  

2:51 2:53 MALE: Have something, it's anchored, you know?

2:53 2:53 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

2:54 2:58 MALE: Like something from your childhood that just kind of like... it anchors you.

2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:58 3:00 MALE: Rather than just being a completely new place - 

3:00 3:00 FEMALE: Right.

3:01 3:02 MALE: - and not having any sort of thing familiar.

3:02 3:02 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:03 3:04 MALE: And just finding yourself completely disoriented.

3:04 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah, I didn't expect to go home after college at all, but I just kind of found myself back there, kind of, "What the hell do I do with a Bachelor's degree in Russian language?  I don't know.  There isn't anything."  So I, um, I actually ended up going to law school for a year and a half, and working in law firms, and was going to go that whole route, and then decided I didn't want to do that, so I dropped out.

3:22 3:23 MALE: How cool.  Good for you.

3:23 3:28 FEMALE: But uh -- but yeah, it was really nice to be home.  And now I'm pretty close, I'm only like an hour and a half plane ride away.

3:28 3:29 MALE: So where's home?

3:29 3:29 FEMALE: Portland, Oregon.

3:30 3:32 MALE: Oh, I hear it's very sweet.

3:32 3:35 FEMALE: It's beautiful, it's wonderful, yeah.  I love it there.

3:35 3:37 MALE: I've never been there.  There's apparently a bookstore that I have to go to.

3:38 3:40 FEMALE: Yeah, Powell's.  Powell's Bookstore.

3:40 3:40 MALE: Powell's.

3:41 3:41 FEMALE: Powell's.  

3:41 3:41 MALE: Powell's.

3:42 3:42 FEMALE: Like Colin Powell.

3:42 3:43 MALE: Like nameX, yeah.

3:43 3:43 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:43 3:43 MALE: Yeah.

3:44 3:53 FEMALE: Yeah, it's great, it's the biggest west -- west of the Mississippi, maybe, the biggest independent bookseller, I don't know, blah, blah, blah, and they have a whole online store now, so they're pretty well known.

3:54 3:54 MALE: Oh.

3:54 3:57 FEMALE: It takes up a whole city block and like four storey's worth of books and stuff.

3:57 3:58 MALE: That's what I've heard.

3:58 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:58 3:59 MALE: I've heard it's just ridiculous.

4:00 4:05 FEMALE: Bookstores and coffee shops.  And like rain and trees.  Like that's -- that's what Portland's all about.

4:06 4:07 MALE: Sounds like the place to be.

4:07 4:07 [Background Noise]

4:07 4:07 FEMALE: Yeah.

4:08 4:08 MALE: Well, it was a pleasure.

4:09 4:09 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

4:10 4:11 MALE: We're almost out. [laughter].
