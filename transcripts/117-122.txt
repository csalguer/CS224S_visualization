0:06 0:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, good to meet you.  So what do you do?
0:08 0:13 MALE:  I'm in Law School.  And I guess that's what you mean by what I do.
0:14 0:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, so what year are you?
0:16 0:17 MALE:  I'm in my third year.
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  Third year.
0:18 0:18 MALE:  Yeah.
0:19 0:19 FEMALE:  Third year program?
0:20 0:22 MALE:  Yeah.  I'm finishing up here pretty soon, yeah.
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  That's exciting.
0:24 0:35 MALE:  It is actually.  I've had a crazy semester this semester, so just stuff outside of school.  But I can't wait to [unintelligible].  Yeah, so what about you?
0:36 0:38 FEMALE:  I'm Ph.D. in Genetics.
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Okay.
0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  But I'm a first year.
0:40 0:40 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  I'll be here awhile.
0:41 0:43 MALE:  Yeah.  How long is it going to take you do you think?
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  The average is 5-1/2 years.
0:45 0:49 MALE:  Okay.  So what did you, did you just graduate from undergrad?
0:50 0:54 FEMALE:  I took a year off so I actually worked with NIH out in D.C. last year.
0:54 0:55 MALE:  Okay.
0:55 0:58 FEMALE:  With a lab down there [unintelligible].
0:59 1:00 MALE:  The National Institute for Health?
1:00 1:05 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Wow, that's great.  Most people don't know [unintelligible] [laughter].
1:06 1:07 MALE:  You just say NIH and go along with it.
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  I'm from D.C.
1:09 1:10 MALE:  Yeah, okay.
1:10 1:14 FEMALE:  But I did college out in Washington State, a small college there.
1:15 1:15 MALE:  What college?
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  Pacific Lutheran [unintelligible].
1:17 1:20 MALE:  Okay.  My sisters lived in Washington State for awhile.
1:21 1:21 FEMALE:  Oh, where at?
1:22 1:26 MALE:  Seattle area, Pounds, the Federal Way.
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:27 1:28 MALE:  Auburn.
1:28 1:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, I kind of know that area.
1:30 1:34 MALE:  Yeah, my sister went to University of [unintelligible].
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.
1:35 1:44 MALE:  You see a sweatshirt actually, are you from Seattle.  Yeah, cool.  So then why did you decide to come out here?
1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  Back to the west coast.
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Yeah.
1:50 1:56 FEMALE:  I've always, my grandparents lived in the Bay area for awhile [unintelligible].  I like palm trees.
1:57 2:27 MALE:  I love palm trees.  Oh my gosh.  I'm so jealous of people who live in cool places.  I grew up in Chicago and I lived in Illinois basically my whole life growing up.  And after I graduated from college, I went to Florida for two years.  And that's where I fell in love with palm trees.  But I always loved warm weather and I always, like whenever it would snow, I'd want the snow to be gone as quickly as possible.  So I'm always jealous of people whose family and friends and everything is in a nice place or you can go back.
2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:29 2:40 MALE:  Yeah, but I'm going to move back to Chicago now just because like I don't want to be away for too long.  I think I'll be there for a couple of years and then come back somewhere nice.  Like I'm always going to [unintelligible].
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  Do you have a job lined up when you're done?
2:42 3:02 MALE:  Yeah.  I actually had a job out here and I was going to stay out here, but then some things changed and I decided to go back to Chicago.  Yeah, so it's a great place, but I'm going to be thinking of I love it here when I'm gone.  It's hard because there are no palm trees there, that's for sure.
3:02 3:06 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:07 3:12 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  That's a problem.  No, but, yeah so.
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  Where did you do college?
3:15 3:16 MALE:  University of Illinois.
3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:17 3:18 MALE:  Yeah.  Did you say where you went to college?
3:18 3:21 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
3:23 3:24 MALE:  That was where you did you're undergrad okay.
3:25 3:26 FEMALE:  But I'm from Colorado.
3:26 3:29 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Well good to meet you.
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  Yeah, good to meet you.
3:31 3:39 MALE:  Talk to you later.  I felt like that was my most rushed one because we started late.  It was good talking to you, though.
