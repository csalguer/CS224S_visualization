0:02 0:02 MALE:  Hello.
0:03 0:03 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:05 0:05 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].
0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  [unintelligible], female122.
0:07 0:08 MALE:  female122, nice to meet you.
0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  Yeah, nice to meet you.  How are you doing?
0:11 0:15 MALE:  Getting really good at filling forms out quickly.  Oh my goodness.
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  I'm getting [unintelligible].
0:18 0:18 MALE:  I know.
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  Okay, give me your scoop now.
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Give me my scoop.
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  They do a lot more every time.
0:24 0:36 MALE:  First year Master student.  I'm Engineering and I just moved here to [unintelligible] and New Mexico.  I'm finally get used to all the rain and now it's started to get sunny again.
0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:38 0:49 MALE:  But I'm used to the sunny.  So sunny doesn't take much to get used to.  So and I'm enjoying it.  This is pretty fun.  I'm glad, everybody has been really incredibly friendly and it's pretty cool.
0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]?
0:50 0:51 MALE:  Yeah.  What about you?
0:52 0:54 FEMALE:  I'm [unintelligible] so I [unintelligible], too.
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Nice.  Do you miss the snow?
0:57 1:06 FEMALE:  No, I thought I would, but I'm okay.  [laughter]  Yeah, I'm first year in Genetics, Ph.D. program.
1:06 1:06 MALE:  Nice.
1:07 1:15 FEMALE:  [unintelligible], Colorado.  College at Washington State, small school there.  Worked at NIH in a lab for a year.
1:16 1:16 MALE:  Right on.
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  And now I'm here.  [unintelligible].
1:19 1:57 MALE:  Cool.  I have, after I got done with [unintelligible], I took off and decided I'm going to work.  I'm done with school.  And so I went to work in Phoenix for GM for awhile and then I got dragged back to Albuquerque because my plant got closed.  I ended up working for Intel for awhile and then I was like you know I promised myself I would go back to grad school in four years.  Well wait, it's been four years.  I need to go back.  And it's been good.  It's been good.  [unintelligible].  Alright.  One of the things I always liked about New Mexico was that you could drive through the snow.  I don't know.
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:59 2:04 MALE:  I've been to Colorado Springs once, but it was in the summer time.  How much snow do they get in the winter?
2:05 2:09 FEMALE:  We can get up to a foot or two and then it melts within a couple of days.
2:09 2:10 MALE:  Oh okay.
2:11 2:20 FEMALE:  The sunshine comes out and melts it, but the mountains get a lot of snow and the ski resorts can be an hour or two.  And you have to drive through the snow.
2:22 2:26 MALE:  Actually that's okay.  I like driving through the snow better than being perpetually buried in it.
2:26 2:28 FEMALE:  Well, I've been there one year.
2:28 2:33 MALE:  My sister would disagree.  She lives in northern Michigan and they get like 200 inches of snow a year.
2:33 2:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:35 3:04 MALE:  She's nuts.  Too much snow.  Too much snow.  You'll see people, well the craziest thing is I was there to visit her and was going, went by the university and there was a guy in front of one of the fraternities sitting in a lawn chair kind of like this with tennis shoes, no socks, unbuttoned shirt and he's like it's beautiful weather.  It's the first time it's been above freezing in like six months.  This is not right.  This is just not right.  So did you do much hiking while you were up in Colorado?
3:05 3:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, I grew up outdoorsy so I really like it.  I wanted to [unintelligible] around here.  [unintelligible].
3:19 3:37 MALE:  Yeah, I used to live right next to the river in Albuquerque and so I'd go every Saturday.  Hike up the river or even better was trail riding.  Like I'd ride my mountain bike up the river.  That was my absolute favorite relaxing experience.  And plus, there's no mountains around here.  I hate that.
3:37 3:38 FEMALE:  Around here?
3:38 3:58 MALE:  Yes.  I loved you know being able to say [unintelligible] is that way.  North is that way.  And now it's like which way is north.  So I've heard though that even though I haven't been there, there's a lot of good places to go hiking around here.
3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
4:01 4:01 MALE:  It was nice talking to you.
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  Yeah, you, too.  Have fun.
