0:45 0:45 FEMALE:  Well then you've had enough time to decide if it's hard or not.  [laughter] I'll take your word for it. 
0:47 0:50 MALE:  Yeah, hard enough when I've been here five years and I'm not done. 
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Okay. I see.

1:00 1:00 FEMALE:  I want to go to Japan. 
1:01 1:01 MALE:  Really?  I just got back from Japan. 
1:02 1:02 FEMALE:  Where?  
1:03 1:07 MALE:  I uh, I went on a trip with my uncle who's on Kyushu, he's a priest-- 
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  Where at in Kyushu?  
1:10 1:10 MALE:  Kumamoto. 
1:11 1:11 FEMALE:  Yeah? 
1:12 1:12 MALE:  Yeah, so--
1:13 1:13 FEMALE:  That's so cool. 
1:14 1:21 MALE:  Oh it was--I was just blown away with the place.  I mean Tokyo got a [unintelligible] pass, went down to Kumamoto and then worked our way back to--
1:22 1:22 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:22 1:23 MALE:  --Kyoto, Sakai--
1:24 1:24 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:25 1:25 MALE:  --Hiroshima, then went to China for a bit.  
1:26 1:27 FEMALE:  Uh huh.  That sounds really awesome.  
1:28 1:30 MALE:  [unintelligible] good time.  Have you spent time [unintelligible] 
1:31 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, I lived there for a year between undergrad and grad school--
1:34 1:34 MALE:  You did the uh--
1:34 1:36 FEMALE:  --I did the jet program, yeah.  And I was in Miyazaki which is right next to Kumamoto.  
1:37 1:37 MALE:  Oh okay. 
1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  So yeah, I--
1:39 1:40 MALE:  [unintelligible] city 600,000 [unintelligible] 
1:41 1:42 FEMALE:  Uh huh. 
1:43 1:46 MALE:  [unintelligible] I couldn't get over that. 
1:47 1:58 FEMALE:  Well it's pretty, it's kind of like, it's got a more metropolitan, kind of cosmopolitan feel to it then like other cities around there.  It seems like the young people are really hip in Tokyo like and--
1:59 2:06 MALE:  Yeah, it's surprising because I, I went to visit my uncle, it's crazy because he's a priest in the Catholic Church and he's across the street from the main department store.  
2:07 2:07 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:08 2:13 MALE:  [unintelligible] like this old church built in the '30s on this empty plot of land, right next to, like the [unintelligible] and all this. 
2:14 2:14 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:15 2:16 MALE:  Its nuts.  
2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  Hmm. 
2:16 2:20 MALE:  And he was saying oh it's off in the sticks, and it's like the day after we got to Japan, didn't really realize--
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
2:21 2:22 MALE:  --like Tokyo and Kyoto.  
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:23 2:23 MALE:  It's like oh.  
2:23 2:23 FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah.  
2:24 2:26 MALE:  Okay, Tokyo's 32 million people, I guess you could call this the sticks.  
2:27 2:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.  [laughter] Yeah, its hard to compare anything to Tokyo, it's just like another planet.  [laughter] 
2:32 2:33 MALE:  It really, it really, I was just amazed by it. 
2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:35 2:35 MALE:  I was amazed by it.  
2:35 2:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:36 2:39 MALE:  What surprised me was that the cost of the living was in [unintelligible] and I know with rent and things, I'm sure it's pretty high. 
2:40 2:46 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. Rent can be bad, and food can sometimes be randomly really weird and high, like fresh fruit is really high.  
2:47 2:47 MALE:  Really?  
2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  Like fresh produce.
2:48 2:58 MALE:  The thing that amazed me, was I was going through Shizuoka and Tokyo and I saw a uh, a grocery store and it had avocados.  1:20 yen for an avocado, it's cheaper then here. 
2:59 3:00 FEMALE:  So avocados maybe--
3:01 3:01 MALE:  Avocados--
3:01 3:03 FEMALE:  But melons can be $30, to $40, to $50.  [laughter] 
3:04 3:05 MALE:  The square ones are like $1:00 and something.  
3:06 3:06 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah.  
3:06 3:07 MALE:  The square watermelon, those are--I never saw one of those. 
3:08 3:09 FEMALE:  I didn't either.  [laughter] 
3:10 3:13 MALE:  But I've heard stories those are specially grown and their weird [unintelligible]. 
3:14 3:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like melon is what you give the people in the hospital when they're sick and stuff.  I'm like--
3:18 3:23 MALE:  Oh yes.  So melon like [unintelligible] stuff.  I know there's a theater and [unintelligible] be expensive [unintelligible] it's cheap. 
3:24 3:47 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Like, yeah some things can be cheap like, but like a kilo of grapes is like $10.  It's like, sometimes it's just really hard, like an apple could be like $3 for one apple.  It's just weird little things that will hit you really hard, and it sneaks up on you.  But when I was living there, and I was teaching, like I had enough money to buy a car and I had my own apartment and like, you know, live pretty comfortably.  
3:48 3:48 MALE:  Really? 
3:48 3:52 FEMALE:  And that was like, because that was like kind of out in the countryside and the apartment was subsidized by the job--
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Oh okay. 
3:54 3:56 FEMALE:  --so it was really sweet, like, it was a really nice lifestyle.  And I'm dying to go back.  
3:57 3:59 MALE:  It was really nice down in Kyushu too, I thought.  
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Oh it's beautiful. 
4:02 4:02 MALE:  Like [unintelligible] it was beautiful. 
           [horn]
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:04 4:04 ANNOUNCER:  Okay, move to the last chair where you started in--
4:05 4:05 FEMALE:  Hmm.
4:06 4:06 MALE:  Anyway. 
4:07 4:07 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you. 
4:07 4:08 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
