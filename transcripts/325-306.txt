0:53 0:54 FEMALE: Ingrian, yeah. They do data encryption.
0:57 1:01 MALE: That was something I was going to go into until people pushed me here into Stanford.
1:03 1:05 FEMALE: Yeah. Times over and then you're stuck.
1:06 1:07 MALE: I was going to go to Carnegie Melon.
1:08 1:08 FEMALE: Do you like it better here?
1:09 1:18 MALE: Yes. Well I didn't go there but I think I enjoy the California setting. It's a really good place to be.
1:18 1:18 FEMALE: It's an awesome place to be,
1:19 1:20 MALE: So you've been here all your life?
1:21 1:24 FEMALE: I was in Hong Kong for 12 years and then I've been here since then.
1:25 1:26 MALE: Okay. I've just come to this country.
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: Where are you from?
1:27 1:27 MALE: India.
1:28 1:30 FEMALE: Okay. Cool. Which part?
1:31 1:32 MALE: Dehli. Been to it before?
1:33 1:48 FEMALE: I've never been to India but I have a lot of friends from India in industry. It's cool. I was just saying if I went to visit India then I have a lot to stay with just to just travel. I've always wanted to go, it's a beautiful country.
1:50 1:52 MALE: So what brought you here to the speed dating?
1:53 1:57 FEMALE: Actually my sister took, she goes here. So she took me in.
1:59 2:08 MALE: Okay. That's a nice way of sort of asking. [unintelligible]. With me it was my roommate, it would be fun.
2:09 2:10 FEMALE: That's fun. That's a way to pass the day.
2:11 2:14 MALE: But I really don't understand how you get to know somebody in four minutes.
2:16 2:18 FEMALE: Is he ambitious? Uh how would I know.
2:20 2:24 MALE: How do I know? Do you share interests? How do I know? I just ask them what they're doing, barely get to know them. 
2:25 2:28 FEMALE: How about this? What do you like to do for fun? Go to the shared interests part.
2:29 2:29 MALE: Theatre.
2:31 2:31 FEMALE: Theatre? That's cool.
2:32 2:33 MALE: I was in professional theatre before coming here.
2:34 2:36 FEMALE: That's awesome, that's totally awesome.
2:37 2:39 MALE: But it's not English theatre, it's Indian theatre.
2:39 2:39 FEMALE: That's still really cool, that's totally cool.
2:42 2:48 MALE: And that is sort of a fine time because I got bored of working in less than a year.
2:48 2:50 FEMALE: What do you think of the movie business in India? There are like so many of them.
2:51 2:55 MALE: There's just too many movies being made. Not enough good movies.
2:56 2:59 FEMALE: Are you more into the theatre or...?
3:01 3:13 MALE: I don't watch too many movies. When I was back home all my friends were movie freaks. Every Friday and Thursday, the first ones to be there. Otherwise I'm into cars and traveling. I love to travel.
3:14 3:14 FEMALE: Where have you been?
3:16 3:19 MALE: Unfortunately, I've been just traveling around India. This is my first time out of the continent.
3:20 3:26 FEMALE: That's still kind of cool. I still think that's fun. I don't know. India's so big and kind of diverse enough to do that.
3:27 3:30 MALE: But my goal for the next ten years while I'm still single, hopefully.
3:31 3:32 FEMALE: Where would you like to go?
3:33 3:41 MALE: I'd actually to go around the world. Go to China, go to Hong Kong, go to New Zealand, Australia, Europe, everywhere.
3:42 3:49 FEMALE: I really want to go to Egypt. I'm not sure if I'd get shot but I'd really like to go to Egypt to see the pyramids and stuff.
3:52 3:55 MALE: I'd love to be in Italy. Somebody asked me this question, what's the first place you had to go? Italy.
3:56 3:56 FEMALE: Italy is beautiful.
3:57 3:57 MALE: I'd love to go.
3:57 3:57 FEMALE: Italy?
3:58 3:58 MALE: Yeah.
3:58 3:58 FEMALE: Italy's great.
3:59 4:02 MALE: It's nothing to do with the place, it has to do with the cars there.
4:01 4:03 FEMALE: Oh. The Lamborghinis and the Ferraris.
4:03 4:06 MALE: I'm into rally car racing.
4:06 4:12 FEMALE: Is that the one where they give you the coordinates and you drive and pick up stuff. You have to rally at a point and then they give you--
4:11 4:20 MALE: What I did in India was a little short rally where you have specific off road tracks and you just pound your car until it's dead.
4:21 4:21 FEMALE: Cool. That sounds like fun.
4:24 4:30 MALE: If you win you get some money. Italy is like-- Italy and Germany, that should be fun.
4:32 4:38 FEMALE: That's cool. The only time I've done that is a video game and that's fun. But I've never actually been in a car to...
4:39 4:44 MALE: For me, it really started from go carting as a kid. You know there's no way; I want to drive but. 
4:45 4:45 FEMALE: You're mom is like whatever.
4:47 4:49 MALE: I can't drive yet so I go gocarting. Mostly I've not had the opportunity to do that in California.
4:50 4:53 FEMALE: I've been to the Malibu race course but it's probably kind of lame for you.
4:54 4:54 MALE: Oh no. I don't know where that is.
4:55 5:01 FEMALE: Yeah. If you go on 101, you go up towards [unintelligible] city they have just the Malibu race tracks with the little go carts.
5:02 5:03 MALE: Yeah. I've heard of that. I'm going to go this Friday, that's tomorrow.
5:04 5:04 FEMALE: That'd be fun.
5:05 5:12 MALE: I wanted to go to Freemont. It's good to meet you.
5:12 5:13 FEMALE: Very nice to meet you.
5:14 5:14 MALE: Same here.
5:14 5:14 FEMALE: Take care.
