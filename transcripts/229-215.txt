1:03 1:07 MALE:  Um, it's good.  It's different.  I'm getting used to it.  Stanford is an amazing campus and people and -
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  It's definitely overwhelming.
1:09 1:10 MALE:  Yeah.
1:10 1:16 FEMALE:  It's nothing like New York University.  Total city school, you know, good luck, don't get hit by a car kid, you know.

1:30 1:31 MALE:  Right.
1:31 1:34 FEMALE:  But you do, you get acclimated pretty quickly, as you say.
1:34 1:37 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:38 1:48 FEMALE:  I'm sure.  I'm sure I will.  Fond memories of slaving away [unintelligible] my schoolwork.  [laughter].  Well, since my program is only a year it is pretty intensive.  
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Yeah.
1:49 1:54 FEMALE:   So, yeah, but I try to make as much you know, time for fun as I can.
1:54 1:55 MALE:  Yeah.
1:55 1:56 FEMALE:  Getting out -- what?
1:55 1:56 MALE:  [unintelligible] afterwards or?
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  That's the big question.  
2:00 2:02 MALE:  You're just trying to get past the [unintelligible].
2:01 2:10 FEMALE:  My life.  One thing at a time, that's what I say.  [laughter].  Job, forget it, like let me just get through this.
2:10 2:11 MALE:  Right.
2:11 2:13 FEMALE:  You know, my masters project presentation in a couple weeks.
2:13 2:14 MALE:  Right.
2:14 2:25 FEMALE:  It's like pulling my hair out right now.  Talk to me afterwards, I'll be a little stressed out -- a little less stressed out, but um, until then, you know, it's like all I do is work, which isn't true.
2:25 2:26 MALE:  Yeah, I know what you mean.
2:26 2:28 FEMALE:  So have you been out around here in Palo Alto?

2:33 2:38 MALE:  Yeah, it's good.  I'm still getting used to the place, it's -- it's different from what I seen before, but -
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  I can only imagine.
2:41 2:42 MALE:  Yeah.
2:43 2:46 FEMALE:  Small town life.  Very different.
2:46 2:48 MALE:  What do you recommend doing here and places to be?
2:49 2:50 FEMALE:  Well, I would recommend going to San Francisco.
2:51 2:55 MALE:  Yeah, everyone has said that so far.  I really want to go, but I haven't had the time.
2:55 2:58 FEMALE:  Really?  Well, do you have a car?  Because if not -
2:58 2:59 MALE:  I don't.
2:59 3:01 FEMALE:  Me neither.  You can still get up.
3:01 3:01 MALE:  [unintelligible],
3:02 3:12 FEMALE:  The train is actually quite convenient and there's so -- there's -- I mean, just anything you want is gonna be up there, right.  But here there's actually a few restaurants that are pretty decent, depending on what type of cuisine.
3:12 3:13 MALE:  Yeah [unintelligible].
3:14 3:19 FEMALE:  There's a good Italian, there's a really good um, Chinese restaurant called Mandarin Gourmet.

3:32 3:35 FEMALE:  Remember gourmet -- Mandarin Gourmet.
3:35 3:36 MALE:  [laughter].
3:36 3:46 FEMALE:  And then people around here will know about it.  It's pretty good.  And um, you know, there's only like a couple bars around here, pretty divey.
3:45 3:46 MALE:  [laughter].
3:46 3:49 FEMALE:  Gotta say.  [laughter].
3:49 3:51 MALE: And that's coming from a New Yorker, so.
3:51 3:58 FEMALE:  That's coming from a New Yorker.  Yeah, there's um -- my friends -- oh.
