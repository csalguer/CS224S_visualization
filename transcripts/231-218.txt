0:02 0:04 FEMALE: Hi, how are you?  
    
0:05 0:06 MALE: Hi, I'm doing pretty well, how are you doing?  
    
0:05 0:06 FEMALE: I'm hanging in there.  
    
0:07 0:08 MALE: All right.  I'm male218.  
    
0:07 0:08 FEMALE: I'm female231.  
    
0:08 0:09 MALE: female231.  
    
0:08 0:09 FEMALE: Pleasure to meet you.  
    
0:10 0:11 MALE: It's a pleasure to meet you too.  
    
0:10 0:11 FEMALE: How's the evening going?  
    
0:12 0:13 MALE: Oh it's going pretty well.  
    
0:11 0:12 FEMALE: Yeah?  
    
0:13 0:24 MALE: I finally figured out--like, I feel like my brain is getting a little bit confused.  Like, it seems like--it feels like half bar, half SAT.  [unintelligible] and it's just like, things are just sort of getting [unintelligible].  
    
0:23 0:24 FEMALE: Fair enough.  
    
0:25 0:26 MALE: I'll get a lot of that sorted out.  
    
0:25 0:26 FEMALE: So are you a law student then?  
    
0:27 0:29 MALE: No, not at all.  I'm a Russian literature--  
    
0:28 0:29 FEMALE: Oh seriously?  
    
0:30 0:31 MALE: So yeah.  So--  
    
0:30 0:31 FEMALE: Oh cool.  
    
0:31 0:35 MALE: So actually it's part of, you know, my line of work also, the study of confusion in general and sort of--  
    
0:34 0:35 FEMALE: Nice.  
    
0:36 0:37 MALE: Cultivate confusion.  
    
0:36 0:37 FEMALE: Yeah.  
    
0:38 0:41 MALE: That's what most of literature's about is cultivating confusion.  
    
0:39 0:40 FEMALE: You think so?  
    
0:41 0:42 MALE: Yeah.  
    
0:40 0:41 FEMALE: Are you a writer yourself or--?  
    
0:42 0:44 MALE: Yeah.  I do do writing.  
    
0:43 0:44 FEMALE: Yeah?  
    
0:44 0:50 MALE: Um, which is probably [unintelligible] but and I also teach the language and some general--  
    
0:48 0:54 FEMALE: Oh cool.  What got you interested in Russian literature and Russian language and--?  
    
0:53 0:58 MALE: That's a good question.  I was sitting by the fountain during spring break, studying for exams.  
    
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: Okay.  
    
1:00 1:03 MALE: All of my friends were, like, [unintelligible] exact same thought crossed my mind.  
    
1:03 1:04 FEMALE: Why am I here?  
    
1:15 1:15 MALE: Why am I here, what am I doing next to this fountain, like, when everybody's, like, off [unintelligible] and I, the answer that came is that I do really like literature, 'cause I'm not always going to have, probably have to study it, you know, in classes.  
    
1:15 1:16 FEMALE: Okay.  
    
1:16 1:27 MALE: It's--it's interesting.  It's like it's very interesting to do something that you're truly passionate about and make that your work too, but I feel like in undergrad it was a lot easier to be, like, sort of passionate about it but not feel like it was work, necessarily.  
    
1:26 1:27 FEMALE: Yeah.  
    
1:28 1:31 MALE: And then it sort of, like, takes on this sort of [unintelligible].  
    
1:30 1:31 FEMALE: Yeah.  
    
1:32 1:36 MALE: Just trying to, I guess, I guess the reason [unintelligible] keep a balance.  
    
1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Okay.  
    
1:37 1:41 MALE: Trying to remember why it's there, trying to keep the passion, but also trying to do everything [unintelligible].  
    
1:40 1:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  
    
1:42 1:43 MALE: What do you do?  
    
1:42 1:44 FEMALE: I'm in the department of communication.  
    
1:45 1:46 MALE: Department of communication.  
    
1:45 1:47 FEMALE: Yeah.  And I just started, so I'm a first year.  
    
1:47 1:48 MALE: First year.  
    
1:47 1:48 FEMALE: Are you--which year are you in?  
    
1:49 1:50 MALE: I'm a third year.  
    
1:49 1:50 FEMALE: Okay.  
    
1:51 1:52 MALE: Um although we usually take like seven or eight years, so--  
    
1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Yeah.  We uh--  
    
1:54 1:55 MALE: [unintelligible].  
    
1:54 2:03 FEMALE: It's funny, I had some friends who were asking me, you know, what's the norm, what do people usually get out in, and our department is so small that it's hard to say what the norm is.  They tell me five years, but--  
    
2:04 2:05 MALE: Five years.  
    
2:04 2:06 FEMALE: I haven't seen anybody finish this year.  
    
2:07 2:10 MALE: Yeah I mean we have, like, we have like ninth and tenth year still around.  
    
2:09 2:10 FEMALE: Really.  
    
2:10 2:14 MALE: And every once in a while you have the department, like, [unintelligible].  
    
2:13 2:14 FEMALE: Says don't do this, or--?  
    
2:15 2:19 MALE: Look at me, you do not want to become this.  So like [unintelligible] for a while as a warning.  
    
2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Yeah.  
    
2:20 2:21 MALE: It's a--  
    
2:20 2:21 FEMALE: Without sun and--  
    
2:22 2:23 MALE: Anything to get us through.  
    
2:22 2:23 FEMALE: Yeah.  
    
2:23 2:32 MALE: They're trying not to [unintelligible] but we're sort of in this awkward place where they're not changing the requirements but they want us to finish two years earlier.  And so I think--  
    
2:29 2:31 FEMALE: Oh yeah, that is awkward.  
    
2:32 2:35 MALE: Yeah.  I think they just think it'll magically happen.  Who knows?  
    
2:35 2:36 FEMALE: I don't know.  
    
2:37 2:38 MALE: Um so what in, what in communications?  
    
2:37 2:39 FEMALE: I'm uh, I'm interested in political communication.  
    
2:40 2:41 MALE: Okay.  
    
2:39 2:42 FEMALE: So the department here kind of has two strengths.  One is political communication.  
    
2:43 2:44 MALE: Okay.  
    
2:42 2:48 FEMALE: One is HCI, which is human-computer interaction.  It's like interface design.  So yeah, pretty disparate things.  
    
2:50 2:54 MALE: Yeah.  That, that sounds like [unintelligible] should almost be like different schools.  
    
2:53 2:55 FEMALE: Well it's sort of interesting.  Communication's kind of a young discipline.  
    
2:56 2:57 MALE: Mm-hmm.  
    
2:56 2:57 FEMALE: So far as disciplines go.  
    
2:58 2:59 MALE: Uh-huh.  
    
2:58 3:00 FEMALE: Uh, our department's been around since maybe the fifties.  
    
3:01 3:02 MALE: Okay.  
    
3:01 3:08 FEMALE: And it was one of the first departments in communication.  Um and different ones have different strengths, but this just happens to be how the faculty has developed.  
    
3:09 3:13 MALE: So is this sort of like the same [unintelligible] during political campaigns and--?  
    
3:12 3:24 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  So my particular interest is in how youth get involved with political activities, which of course, you know, the most recent campaign, particularly prior to, like, Kerry getting the nomination back with Dean and things like that.  
    
3:25 3:26 MALE: Something about internet being important then.  
    
3:25 3:26 FEMALE: Yes, that's--  
    
3:27 3:28 MALE: Something about that.  
    
3:27 3:30 FEMALE: Exactly.  Something about new media.  Yeah.  So that's what I'm interested in, so.  
    
3:30 3:32 MALE: [unintelligible] vaguely remember [unintelligible].  
    
3:31 3:33 FEMALE: It might've stuck in your head after you heard it a thousand times?  
    
3:33 3:37 MALE: Yeah.  Maybe like the 17th New York Times article I came across.  
    
3:37 3:38 FEMALE: Right.  
    
3:38 3:39 MALE: Well it must be--that must be interesting.  
    
3:38 3:39 FEMALE: It's pretty cool.  
    
3:40 3:42 MALE: What exactly is happening right now?  
    
3:41 3:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's--well, it's interesting because we're sort of in a down time in between campaigns, so it's actually sort of interesting because lots of people are publishing work now based on all the data that they collected in the last campaign.  So there's actually kind of a rash of articles coming out right now.  
    
3:55 3:59 MALE: [unintelligible] predictive [unintelligible] try and figure out what's going to happen?  
    
3:58 3:59 FEMALE: Well, sure.  
    
3:59 4:00 MALE: Okay.  
    
3:59 4:02 FEMALE: Um and it sort of depends on [horn] whether or not you believe it can be predictive, so.  
    
4:02 4:03 MALE: Oh cool.  
    
4:02 4:04 FEMALE: Anyway.  Very nice meeting you.  
    
4:04 4:06 MALE: Very nice to meet you.  And take care.  
    
4:05 4:06 FEMALE: You too.  
    
4:06 4:09 MALE: Good luck with all of that and especially the predictive [unintelligible].  
    
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: Thank you.
