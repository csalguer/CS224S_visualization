00:02 00:02 MALE: Hi.  
00:01 00:04 FEMALE: Hi.  I don't know if we're allowed to start talking yet.  [laughter] 
00:05 00:07 MALE: I don't know.  It could be against the rules.  
00:06 00:07 FEMALE: What's your name?  
00:09 00:09 MALE: male311.  
00:07 00:08 FEMALE: Okay, I'm female331.  
00:10 00:10 MALE: Okay.  
00:09 00:11 FEMALE: So we rhyme.  That's good.  [laughter] 
00:19 00:20 MALE: Have you ever done one of these things before?  
00:19 00:23 FEMALE: Um, yeah.  Actually I did one, um, that was through Escondido Village.  
00:25 00:26 MALE: Oh, really?  
00:24 00:30 FEMALE: Uh, with my friend nameX, yeah, a little while ago, like maybe a month or so ago but, um--well, [laughter]. 
00:31 00:32 MALE: Is that begin?  I guess that's begin.  
00:31 00:37 FEMALE: Yeah, begin, so.  So yeah.  But it was okay.  It wasn't, you know, great.  I actually made more friends, really, but moving, but--
00:39 00:39 MALE: Well, that's worth it then.  
00:37 00:39 FEMALE: I'm open.  So we'll see.  Now, how about you?  
00:41 00:42 MALE: So what do you study?  
00:41 00:41 FEMALE: English.  
00:43 00:44 MALE: Oh, you do?  
00:42 00:43 FEMALE: And you?  
00:44 00:50 MALE: Well, I'm, uh, I did business, I got my MBA.  Now I'm doing the EE, electrical engineering.    
00:49 00:49 FEMALE: Really?  
00:51 00:52 MALE: Yeah.  So it's sort of weird.  
00:51 00:52 FEMALE: Why did you--  
00:54 00:55 MALE: Why didn't I do it the other way around?  
00:53 00:53 FEMALE: Or why did you switch?  
00:56 00:59 MALE: Oh, no, no, I didn't switch.  I finished my MBA and now I'm doing my, getting my EE degree.  
00:58 00:59 FEMALE: Did you know before you were going to--
01:02 01:11 MALE: No, not really, actually.  The funny thing is that when I went to engineering school--I don't have an engineering undergrad degree, they were, like, there's a snowball's chance in hell of getting in here.  
01:09 01:09 FEMALE: Really?  
01:11 01:13 MALE: Yeah.  So I was, like--
01:11 01:11 FEMALE: Cool. 
01:13 01:15 MALE: I'm just going to apply and get in on spite.  
01:14 01:15 FEMALE: Well, that' works a lot, doesn't it?  [laughter] 
01:17 01:20 MALE: I know, it does.  It's, like, it totally worked, you know.  
01:19 01:20 FEMALE: But at Stanford both times, right?  
01:22 01:23 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  And so--
01:22 01:23 FEMALE: You're not sick of this place already?  
01:25 01:26 MALE: No, well I actually work part-time, too.  
01:25 01:26 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
01:30 01:38 MALE: Yeah, I try to balance it out.  So it's going to take me longer to finish the degree but just paying--there's so much debt I'm going to get after finishing all this.  
01:35 01:40 FEMALE: But don't you get, um, they don't pay you?  Because, like, in the English department they give us a stipend every year--
01:43 01:46 MALE: I don't get--I don't get--no, I have to pay pretty much all, yeah.  
01:43 01:50 FEMALE: Really?  Well, you guys will be making money and we won't.  So they're saying, like, so they pay us now and they're, like, good luck [unintelligible].
01:52 01:53 MALE: So are you going to be a professor?  
01:53 01:57 FEMALE: It seems the most fun, I think, job that, you know.  So I'm going to do that.  
01:59 02:01 MALE: What's, uh, what's your, uh, what's your, uh, focus?  
02:00 02:12 FEMALE: Um, probably poetry, and also philosophy.  I'm more interested in, like, philosophy--some of the great ideas.  So I'm really interested in, like, really ideas that are expressed in literature and through their historical preference and that kind of stuff.  
02:15 02:17 MALE: And what kind--is there any particular kind of poetry you--  
02:16 02:26 FEMALE: Um, like contemporary.  I love all the artsy stuff that, you know, [unintelligible].  I don't know how I'm going to support myself, but you know, [laughter], it's, like, but I will.  
02:26 02:36 MALE: I think that's neat.  But you write poetry as well?  Really.  Wow.  That's neat.  Do you have to, like, publish or something to get into the--I don't know.  
02:33 02:36 FEMALE: Yeah, um.  Yeah, I have but you don't have to.  
02:39 02:40 MALE: Okay. 
02:37 02:39 FEMALE: And other people have to, though.  
02:40 02:41 MALE: Oh, wow.  
02:39 02:57 FEMALE: So I think that depends.  If you have other stuff that's really excellent that they'll take, you know.  Um, I mean, there's only ten of us in our entire year.  Well, ten of us in the last year and this year they admitted nine.  So, um, and this is from across all over the United States.  So I mean, I think they had, like, 400 applicants or 500 and they picked 10.  Or they picked more, like, you know.    
02:59 03:02 MALE:  You musts be, like, beside yourself when you got in here.  
03:00 03:15 FEMALE: But the hardest thing is when you're in here and you're used to kind of being, like, you know, whatever, the star of your university.  And then you come here and I'm, like, oh my God, I'm not, like, the star and all of a sudden, like, these people can say things better than me.  I used to always be the clever one in class, you know.  And it's really humbling.  
03:16 03:17 MALE: Where did you do your undergrad?  
03:15 03:16 FEMALE: UCLA.  
03:18 03:19 MALE: Okay.  
03:16 03:17 FEMALE: So it's really humbling.  
03:19 03:20 MALE: My mom went there.  
03:18 03:18 FEMALE: Really?  
03:21 03:21 MALE: Yeah.  
03:19 03:19 FEMALE: Uh, did she like it?  
03:22 03:22 MALE: Loved it.  
03:20 03:24 FEMALE: Yeah.  But that's not the case here.  So here I'm, like, all right, I'm one of the ten.  
03:27 03:30 MALE: The ten.  That is a small group.  Compared to, like--
03:26 03:27 FEMALE: [laughter] 
03:31 03:36 MALE: I've never been in sort of a class of ten people.  Do you, like TA and stuff like that?  
03:33 03:38 FEMALE: I do, but, um, I TA--I have the students--I just started TA'ing this quarter.  I've, like, 15 students [unintelligible].
03:40 03:42 MALE: Oh, really.  Are you, like, harsh?  
03:41 03:45 FEMALE: [laughter] No.  [laughter] 
03:45 03:46 MALE: [unintelligible] 
03:51 04:08 FEMALE: No, but I like to be a little bit bossy.  Like, I have them read a little thing and I said be dramatic, you know.  And it--like, no, it said softly.  Read it softly.  So it's kind of fun.  I order them around [unintelligible].  It's better for them to be laughing and maybe making fun of me than to be boring.  I hate when it's boring.   
04:11 04:17 MALE: Yeah.  Like when people are monotone they're, like, the cat jumped out of the basket.  
04:14 04:19 FEMALE: Yeah.  Especially English.  And they're, like, this stuff is dumb anyway.  And I'm, like, no, it can be fun and, you know, you get excited about it.  
04:22 04:27 MALE: So what is it you do, is it the senior teaching sort of, like classical poetry or is it more like English 1A?  
04:25 04:26 FEMALE: It's actually short story.  
04:28 04:29 MALE: Oh, short story.  Oh, really?  
04:26 04:27 FEMALE: Development of your short story.  
04:30 04:31 MALE: Oh, so they write, write, too?  
04:29 04:36 FEMALE: Oh, no, no, no.  It's about--like a lit class.  Well, actually it's good.  All right.  [laughter] So you have to fill this stuff out [unintelligible]. 
04:35 04:40 MALE: Oh that was fast.  I think--yeah, we have to go to our station.  
04:38 04:40 FEMALE: I think I got caught in my room.  I'm all right, yeah.  
04:43 04:44 MALE: So.  
04:41 04:43 FEMALE: [laughter] All right.  
04:46 04:48 MALE: Okay.  Lovely to meet you.  
04:44 04:45 FEMALE: Lovely to meet you.
