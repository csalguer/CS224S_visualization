0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  So--

0:37 0:41 MALE:  So, now we're friends, yeah.  And I've--I've kind of been helping her too, I guess she had a crisis of not enough women.

0:42 0:43 FEMALE:  That's what I heard.

0:42 0:44 MALE:  So, I helped out by sending some e-mails for her.

0:45 0:47 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] to your girlfriends.  Your female friends, I'm sorry.

0:46 0:48 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, actually, one of my ex-girlfriends.  [laughter].

0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  Oh, really.

0:49 0:50 MALE:  That's kind of awkward.  [laughter].

0:51 0:53 FEMALE:  Well--well, just helping each other out, I guess.

0:52 0:57 MALE:  Exactly.  I--I--it's like when we were across from each other it's like okay are we going to put each other down.  I don't know.

0:59 1:01 FEMALE:  So, are you in the school [unintelligible]?

1:00 1:01 MALE:  Uh, CS actually.

1:02 1:03 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

1:01 1:02 MALE:  How about you?

1:03 1:07 FEMALE:  Actually, I'm in the department of dev bio--developmental biology, yeah, so.

1:04 1:06 MALE:  Cool. How do you like it?

1:09 1:14 FEMALE:  Okay.  Well, I'll tell you I'm a little bit tired of doing what I'm doing, so I am ready for a job right now.

1:13 1:14 MALE:  Feeling kind of burned out?

1:15 1:17 FEMALE:  A little bit, yeah.  I just--

1:16 1:17 MALE:  Yeah, I'm getting that too.

1:18 1:20 FEMALE:  Are you in the Ph.D. program?

1:19 1:19 MALE:  Yeah, third year.

1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  I see.

1:21 1:24 MALE:  I'm trying to decide whether to go away for the summer, stay here and research.  I kind of need a break.

1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:25 1:27 MALE:  I might do an internship or something.

1:30 1:32 FEMALE:  I see.  

1:28 1:29 MALE:  That's kind of the current dilemma.

1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  You mean out away from Stanford or away from the country?

1:31 1:34 MALE:  Away from Stanford.  There's a company in Iowa actually of all places.

1:35 1:37 FEMALE:  Oh, but you guys can actually do it in the [unintelligible], right?

1:37 1:37 MALE:  Yeah.

1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  That would be nice.

1:38 1:39 MALE:  Yeah, and you make a little money, and you get some experience.  

1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  That's true.

1:40 1:44 MALE:  I think that's actually really good.  I--I worked for a year before under--after under grad before grad school.

1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  I see.

1:45 1:46 MALE:  I think that's been really good for me so.

1:47 1:51 FEMALE:  I think, yeah, it would be good for like overall like track record, right, or just for your resume.

1:51 1:53 MALE:  Yeah, well, that too, you make some contacts maybe they hire you.

1:54 2:02 FEMALE: That's true.  It's like I have been from school to school, so I don't really know, like, [unintelligible] call the real world already so.  Most people I know are in academia so.

2:01 2:02 MALE:  Yeah.  Is that where you want to end up too?

2:03 2:05 FEMALE:  Nope.  [laughter].  Definitely not.

2:04 2:07 MALE:  So, what do you imagine yourself doing in two years?

2:07 2:10 FEMALE:  Hopefully bio [unintelligible] research scientist position.

2:12 2:13 MALE:  [unintelligible].

2:11 2:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, but just like--I think connections of really--like most important thing for finding a job and I don't really have much connection with commercial world [unintelligible], so it's kind of hard.

2:19 2:23 MALE:  Are there opportunities for that like job fairs, internships, [unintelligible]?

2:21 2:31 FEMALE:  There are postings and there are actually lots of postings, but usually you just don't hear back from any of the courses.  You get like an all medical reply e-mail, but that's pretty much it so.

2:30 2:33 MALE:  Yeah, and your--your resume goes in a file cabinet somewhere.

2:34 2:38 FEMALE:  Yeah so now I'm trying to like, oh, like trying to find a friend or my friend's husbands who know somebody so.

2:37 2:39 MALE:  Yeah, that's what you got to do is networking.

2:39 2:40 FEMALE:  It's net working, yeah.

2:39 2:41 MALE:  Maybe you'll meet somebody tonight who knows.

2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Maybe.

2:41 2:42 MALE:  That would be cool.

2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  Two birds--like cease two birds with one stone, right?  [laughter].

2:45 2:45 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.

2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  Who knows.  So--

2:47 2:52 MALE:  Like, I don't know if you get--I don't know if there's a space saying, you know, business client relationship.  I'm not interested in dating, but I would like to go into business.

2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  That would be fun.

2:53 2:55 MALE:  Or you could do both, I mean, that might be a problem.

2:56 3:00 FEMALE:  That can't hurt.  So, how do you like it so far tonight?

2:59 3:05 MALE:  It's all right.  I don't know.  Um, the other two things that I didn't [unintelligible] to the speeding were super loud and this is much better.  

3:06 3:06 FEMALE:  Oh.

3:06 3:07 MALE:  Like I can't tell you how loud they were 

3:09 3:10 FEMALE:  You mean, like, just--

3:08 3:13 MALE:  A little room with like echoes every--and you just couldn't hear the other person.  This is just like so nice.

3:13 3:17 FEMALE:  Oh.  Oh, that sucks.  Is it like outside of like Stanford, like, are you--

3:16 3:17 MALE:  No, these were both here.  Um--

3:18 3:20 FEMALE:  So, they picked the right room to [unintelligible].

3:18 3:22 MALE:  They were like in the--the Limon [phonetic] Lounge and somewhere in NEB [phonetic].

3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

3:24 3:25 MALE:  So, this is--it's so loud.  So, this is--

3:25 3:26 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

3:25 3:30 MALE:  Yeah, this is much better and I'm glad.  I was kind of worried because, you know, with the recording [unintelligible] not even be able to hear.

3:30 3:32 FEMALE:  Oh, it will be bad for the research that's right.  [laughter].

3:31 3:32 MALE:  Yeah, she might just get--

3:33 3:34 FEMALE:  All they hear is white noise.

3:33 3:34 MALE:  --a buzz, yeah, exactly.

3:35 3:37 FEMALE:  So, [unintelligible].

3:35 3:37 MALE:  I don't know.  The recording thing is a little bit weird.

3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, I agree.

3:38 3:39 MALE:  Does it make you nervous?

3:40 3:47 FEMALE:  Not really.  I think after a while you just forget [unintelligible] the existence of [unintelligible] and it's just like what can I do about it.  You can't cover it up.  It's like, oh, well, I'll  just ignore it.

3:47 3:54 MALE:  Yeah, I mean, I have to kind of be careful of what I say.  Like what if I tell the same jokes to all 16 women and then she finds out about it.  [laughter].  That would be bad.

3:54 3:56 FEMALE:  I know.

3:55 3:57 MALE:  You see now I can't tell that joke again.  [laughter].

3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Well, nice meeting you.

3:57 3:58 MALE:  Nice meeting you.  Good luck.

3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  Thank you, you too.
