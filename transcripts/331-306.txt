00:02 00:02 FEMALE: Hi.  [laughter] 
00:01 00:02 MALE: Hi.  
00:04 00:06 FEMALE: male306, [unintelligible].  female331.  
00:05 00:06 MALE: female331.  Good to meet you.  
00:08 00:08 FEMALE: Good to meet you too.  
00:08 00:11 MALE: Um, I have no idea what I'm doing here and what to say.  
00:13 00:18 FEMALE: Look what I did.  My sheet fell out.  It's horrible.  So now, you know, there goes that.  [laughter] 
00:17 00:18 MALE: Yeah.  That's okay.  
00:20 00:22 FEMALE: What are you doing here?  Are you a business school student?  
00:21 00:23 MALE: Half in business school, half in engineering.  
00:25 00:26 FEMALE: What do you mean?  You can't do half and half.  
00:26 00:27 MALE: Yeah, I'm doing management, science and engineering.  
00:28 00:29 FEMALE: Okay.  [laughter] 
00:28 00:31 MALE: It's like a pseudo cover for--pseudo way to get into the B school.  
00:32 00:34 FEMALE: Are you going to try to actually get into the business school or?  
00:33 00:34 MALE: No, I'm just taking classes there.  
00:35 00:37 FEMALE: Okay.  So that's how you use it to [unintelligible].  
00:37 00:41 MALE: I brought the other--I've come back, maybe, now five [unintelligible].  
00:42 00:43 FEMALE: Come on, really?  Through business [unintelligible]?  
00:42 00:43 MALE: Maybe. 
00:43 00:45 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Huh.  
00:45 00:47 MALE: Maybe, if I feel like it.  
00:47 00:48 FEMALE: If it works out, and--
00:48 00:50 MALE: I think mostly I'm just too bored at working at this.  
00:51 00:53 FEMALE: Are you going to work right afterwards?  Just like--
00:52 00:52 MALE: Yes.  
00:53 00:55 FEMALE: When are you graduating?  
00:54 00:54 MALE: Uh, next June.  
00:56 00:57 FEMALE: You have another year?  
00:56 00:58 MALE: Yeah.  I'm just taking this program slowly.  
00:59 01:01 FEMALE: [laughter] It's the best way.  Like, what's the big hurry, right?  
01:01 01:03 MALE: Yeah.  People come here, graduate in nine months and... 
01:04 01:06 FEMALE: You're, like, why?  So you can start your life working?  [laughter] 
01:07 01:08 MALE: You're going to work for the next 40 years.  
01:09 01:24 FEMALE: You might as well take a break.  [laughter] But they don't pay you, like, I'm in the English department here, Ph.D., but they pay us money to recruit us to be here so, like, it's not much.  It's a small stipend.  But we get some money.  So, like, so it's an incentive for us to stay here longer if we get the funding.  
01:24 01:24 MALE: Yeah. 
01:25 01:35 FEMALE: So as soon as we get the funding, like, I'm in no rush.  I want to have them pay for me to go do some, you know, so there's a not a big incentive for me to leave right away.  But for you guys, do they not pay you so there's not an incentive?  
01:34 01:34 MALE: No, I don't have.  
01:36 01:44 FEMALE: See, that's why there's a big rush.  People go, like, oh, I want to save money.  But for us we're, like, well, what the hell, you know?  We're not going to make money anyway later on so, like, whatever.  [laughter] 
01:43 01:47 MALE: How much of [unintelligible] 
01:47 01:50 FEMALE: You know, in the long run.  This is why.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
01:51 01:52 MALE: So you said you're in the Ph.D. program?  
01:53 01:55 FEMALE: Yes.  In the English department.  
01:54 01:56 MALE: Do you guys, like, work a lot?  
01:59 01:59 FEMALE: Do we what?  
01:59 02:02 MALE: Do you work a lot just by, like, my roommate is a Ph.D. student.  In GSB.    
02:04 02:04 FEMALE: Oh in GSB.  
02:04 02:04 MALE: I mean, I've never seen him work.  
02:06 02:07 FEMALE: Are you serious?  
02:06 02:07 MALE: [unintelligible]
02:08 02:11 FEMALE: But he's the business school and he never works?  Like, are you saying he's--he parties a lot?  
02:11 02:12 MALE: He parties a lot, let's say.  
02:13 02:37 FEMALE: Well, see, we kind of do and we don't.  It depends.  When there's a paper due, like the week before, no, nothing, like, we're dead.  But if there's not a paper due for another three weeks, oh yeah.  We'll go out, you know, whatever.  But it depends.  It's very sporadic.  It's very, like, fits and spurts, like, let's go out every day this week and then the next two weeks don't talk to me because I'm locked in my room on my computer.  You know, so it's that kind of thing.  It's not very regular.  What about for you, is it more balanced, I'm guessing?  Do you have regular assignments?  
02:38 02:44 MALE: We do have [unintelligible] people working hard enough, but I just [unintelligible] it's okay.  
02:43 02:44 FEMALE: [laughter] Okay.  
02:44 02:50 MALE: We can manage.  Not like math, I disliked it.  Why should I need to do the boring?  Just have as much fun.  Math would be just work.  
02:50 02:52 FEMALE: Is that what you play--your philosophy?  
02:52 02:54 MALE: No, I think just end up that way.    
02:54 03:06 FEMALE: Actually that kind of happened to me this quarter because I think I was partying up until they--last week and then, like, all right, week seven and I think seven [unintelligible] okay, I have four good weeks, now I can devote myself to my paper.  Yeah?  So all right.  
03:07 03:08 MALE: So where do you hang around?  
03:09 03:10 FEMALE: I live on campus.  
03:11 03:12 MALE: No, I meant partying.  
03:13 03:24 FEMALE: Oh, where, like, where do I hang out?  I hang around, like, in coffee shops.  A friend might go to San Francisco because she has a car.  We go to San Francisco.  I've gone to Berkeley a few times.  Like, I think, Palo Alto [unintelligible].  I mean, where do you go?  
03:24 03:25 MALE: I don't, I don't have a car, so.
03:26 03:28 FEMALE: Oh, I don't either.  I use my friend's or I go with my friends.  
03:28 03:29 MALE: Yeah, that is true.  
03:30 03:31 FEMALE: You just need friends with cars.  [laughter] 
03:31 03:33 MALE: Well, yes.  Absolutely.  
03:34 03:53 FEMALE: See that's a very--you don't need a car.  You just need to have good friends with car and then you, like, [unintelligible] today and I said, do you want to go get some food?  I'm hungry.  Then we go get food.  But if she didn't say okay, I'm stuck in the dorm, you know, eating a candy bar.  So it's not, you know, I can't go out and get dinner myself.  It's kind of hard.  I mean, how do get groceries?  You go with your friends shopping?  
03:53 03:54 MALE: Yes, my roommate has--both my roommates have cars.  
03:55 03:57 FEMALE: See.  Yeah.  Where do you live?  
03:58 03:58 MALE: Escondido Boulevard.  
03:58 03:59 FEMALE: Oh, you're also live in EB.  Where in EB?  
04:00 04:01 MALE: 19.  
04:00 04:02 FEMALE: Oh, so you're one of the high-rise?  
04:02 04:03 MALE: No, no.  The low-rise. 
04:04 04:05 FEMALE: It looks like a camp [laughter] 
04:05 04:06 MALE: Yes, it does.  
04:07 04:10 FEMALE: Doesn't it?  Like summer camp.  I'm, like, cool, what is this?  
04:10 04:11 MALE: It was great meeting you.  
04:11 04:12 FEMALE: It was lovely to meet you, male306.
