FILE NAME: Male Speaker 106 -- Female Speaker 136


@0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
@0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  So you get the resume out of the way. I know who you are.  
0:00 0:01 FEMALE: I'm female136.
0:10 0:12 MALE:  female136?  Okay, I can't--see I'm male106.  
0:03 0:05 FEMALE:  male106, okay, nice to meet you.  
0:14 0:18 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  Shall we start the conversation a normal way, or?  
0:09 0:11 FEMALE:  No, let's start in a different way.  
0:21 0:21 MALE:  Okay, all right.  
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  Um, and it can't be where are you from?  
0:24 0:27 MALE:  Okay, I was going to say what do you like to do for fun here at Stanford?  
0:20 0:24 FEMALE:  Um, I like to explore the area around Stanford, Northern California.
0:34 0:38 MALE:  Where have you--what have you find in your explorations to this point?  
0:30 0:32 FEMALE:  Um, well, I I I found Tahoe.  
0:41 0:42 MALE:  Uh-huh. I found that too.  
0:34 0:38 FEMALE:  [laughter] I found, amazing.  So few people find it! Um, I found Napa.
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Okay, nice.  
0:41 0:44 FEMALE:  I found Monterey and Big Sur.  
0:53 0:55 MALE:  Uh-huh, and did you do the 17-mile drive down there?  
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  I found that too.  [laughter]
0:57 1:08 MALE:  Did you?  I wonder if I found it first or if you did?  I didn't see your flag there or anything. I must have found it first.  I didn't put up a flag.  
1:01 1:06 FEMALE:  Um, and and just found random places, closer by.
1:15 1:15 MALE:  Okay.  
1:07 1:08 FEMALE:  How about you?  What else have you found?  
1:17 1:29 MALE:  I--I. Hmm, I can't think of anything other than what you found.  I think you named them all.  I mean I've gone to the city, San Jose, been to the city a lot.  
1:20 1:23 FEMALE:  I have, I have.  What-, What's your favorite neighborhood?  
1:34 1:38 MALE:  Neighborhoods, I don't know.  It's tough to say.  I don't think I have one.  
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:39 1:44 MALE:  And I'm kind of confused about what the neighborhoods are called and what they--how about you?  Do you have a favorite?  
1:36 1:43 FEMALE:  It's hard to say because, um, like there's--I've mostly just gone to the city in the evening.  
1:53 1:53 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:45 1:49 FEMALE:  Um, so, it's hard like to get a feeling for the neighborhoods if they're sort of their bars.
2:00 2:08 MALE:  Yeah, exactly, and what bands happen to be there at that time also.  
1:59 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah. Yeah Yeah. But, I mean so far for those purposes, for restaurants and bars and things, I like the Mission, and I like, um, the Marina, I like, yeah.
2:18 2:18 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  Friends like [unintelligible].  Yeah.  
2:20 2:23 MALE:  Yeah, I like the Marina also.
2:15 2:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, So, now we can get back to the conventional.
2:27 2:27 MALE:  We can?  
2:17 2:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, we can if you want to.  
2:28 2:30 MALE:  Okay, we don't have to.  We can--
2:22 2:24 FEMALE:  Actually I'm curious.  What major are you?
2:33 2:34 MALE:  Okay, can you guess?  
2:25 2:35 FEMALE:  Well, I know it's not a good predictor but a lot of people have been in electrical engineering.  But people [crosstalk].  
2:45 2:45 MALE:  It's called computer science.  
2:39 2:39 FEMALE:  Oh cool.  
2:48 2:55 MALE:  But I am working in the genetics department.  So, I'm not quite that nerdy.  I'm a few steps.
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  Okay.  
2:55 2:58 MALE:  Kind of a few steps off.  I want to do computational biology.  
2:52 3:01 FEMALE:  And there is probably a lot of need for that.  So what, what kinds of applications are you looking at?  Like what--what are you particularly interested in?  
3:12 3:23 MALE:  Like stuff like possibly aligning two DNA sequences quickly or like finding highly repetitive regions in the DNA sequence because they're probably important for something.  
3:15 3:15 FEMALE:  Uh-huh, cool.  
3:24 3:27 MALE:  That's the stuff I'd want to do.  
3:19 3:20 FEMALE:  Cool, how long have you been here?  
3:29 3:31 MALE:  I'm doing a Master's here so it's my second year.  
3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  Cool.  
3:33 3:39 MALE:  And I've actually applied for a PhD in a few places, but I'm not sure that I want to do that or where I want to go.  
3:30 3:31 FEMALE:   Yeah.  Yeah.  
3:40 3:44 MALE:  Even though the deadline is past, I haven't heard back from everywhere yet.  So, I haven't made a decision.  
3:36 3:37 FEMALE:  So, you're still like--
3:46 3:46 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
3:37 3:37 FEMALE:  --I have no idea?  
3:47 3:49 MALE:  Yeah, pretty much.  How about you?  
3:41 3:44 FEMALE:  This is my first year in the law school.  So--
3:52 3:53 MALE:  [interposing]  Oh, okay.  
3:46 3:50 FEMALE:  So, I have the luxury of knowing where I was going to be for the next couple of years.  
4:00 4:01 MALE:  Yeah, that's nice.   
3:52 3:56 FEMALE:  Um, which is kind of nice, but, yeah, I really like it so
far, despite all the scary things, a lot of reading.
4:05 4:07 MALE:  Uh-huh, A lot of reading?  Uh-huh.  
3:56 4:01 FEMALE:  Oh wow, it was really nice to meet you.  
4:12 4:13 MALE:  Yeah, nice to meet you too.
