0:03 0:11 FEMALE: Oh, my.  That sound is, like, still bizarre to me. Sorry.  I'm female335. 
0:12 0:13 MALE: female335?  I'm male303. What's going on?
0:13 0:14 FEMALE: Not much.  It's nice to meet you.
0:15 0:15 MALE: You as well.
0:18 0:22 FEMALE: Um, are you gonna go see Star Wars? Somebody was just talking about Star Wars [unintelligible].
0:22 0:23 MALE: Yeah?  Are you a big fan?
0:23 0:34 FEMALE: Well, Episode 1 I saw with one of my best friends, and we, like, slept out for tickets and--I remember that very vividly.  And I wasn't so excited about Episode 2.  I saw it after a couple--like, it'd been out for a couple weeks.  
0:34 0:35 MALE: Okay. 
0:35 0:37 FEMALE: Um, I don't think I'm going to go all out for Episode 3, but I'll see it. 
0:37 0:38 MALE: [unintelligible] seen 4, 5, and 6?
0:38 0:40 FEMALE: Oh, yeah.  Of course. 
0:41 0:41 MALE: [unintelligible].
0:41 0:42 FEMALE: They are. 
0:42 0:45 MALE: Did you see them when they were, like, digitally remastered and new scenes were put in?
0:45 0:56 FEMALE: Actually, I have to admit, I have--I didn't rewatch them when Episode 1 was about to come out, so I haven't seen them in a long time.  But I used to watch them a lot when I was little.  You know, child of the '80s and stuff. 
0:55 0:56 MALE: Where'd you grow up?
0:56 0:57 FEMALE: Sacramento.
0:57 0:58 MALE: So not very far. 
0:58 1:01 FEMALE: No, Northern California girl, through and through. 
1:01 1:01 MALE: Yeah?  
1:01 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah, I went to Stanford for college also, so--
1:03 1:04 MALE: When did you graduate?
1:04 1:04 FEMALE: '02.
1:05 1:06 MALE: I was '00. 
1:06 1:06 FEMALE: Okay. 
1:08 1:09 MALE: What, uh--what're you doing here now?
1:10 1:12 FEMALE: I'm getting my PhD in biology.
1:15 1:18 MALE: How long is that?  That's, like, five, six years?
1:18 1:21 FEMALE: Actually, four, so I'll be done next year. 
1:22 1:23 MALE: [unintelligible] so then what?
1:24 1:37 FEMALE: Academia.  Um, well, then I'm going to do a post-doctoral fellowship, so I'll just be an independent researcher for a while, which I'm looking forward to.  Kind of not being a student, but not having responsibilities either.  Just work.  So that'll be fun. 
1:38 1:40 MALE: So when you're not doing biology, what kind of music do you like to listen to?
1:42 1:48 FEMALE: I listen to pretty much everything.  Even--I know it's not an answer.  The truth is, music doesn't play--
1:48 1:49 MALE: [unintelligible]
1:49 2:09 FEMALE: No, I like it.  It just doesn't play that big a role in my life, um, except when I'm in a car.  It's very important when I'm driving.  Um, but I do listen to everything, including, like, Eminem and country and alternative.  But I'm not very discriminating.  Like, I'll listen to whatever's on the radio and kind of not be too annoyed with it.  Um, I just went to see Maroon 5 in concert. 
2:09 2:10 MALE: How were they? 
2:10 2:22 FEMALE: Okay.  So I was not sure how it was gonna be because I think their music's really produced, and so I thought they probably wouldn't sound so good, um, live, but they've done a great--I thought.  I enjoyed it.  It was at [unintelligible] pavilion. 
2:22 2:22 MALE: Yeah. 
2:22 2:23 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:23 2:24 MALE: So it was, like, [unintelligible]. 
2:24 2:26 FEMALE: Yeah.  And it was 12,000 people.
2:27 2:28 MALE: Oh, was it packed?
2:28 2:29 FEMALE: Yeah. And it's funny because--
2:29 2:29 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
2:30 2:34 FEMALE: It was, and it was--well, it was packed with, like, you know, 12-year-old girls, but [laughter] it was packed. 
2:34 2:35 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
2:34 2:41 FEMALE: And, uh--[laughter].  Yeah, they were excited.  But the last time I saw them, they were opening for Guster.  And, you know--
2:41 2:42 MALE: I love Guster. 
2:42 2:54 FEMALE: Guster's a good band.  It's a good band, but, uh, yeah.  I do, in fact, listen to everything.  So, tell me this, if you had to pick, like, three albums--your favorite albums--
2:54 2:55 MALE: Okay. 
2:56 3:00 FEMALE: I always do favorites in threes because one isn't fair, but more than that--
3:00 3:01 MALE: Three favorite albums?
3:01 3:02 FEMALE: Three albums.  Yeah. 
3:02 3:03 MALE: That's a good one. 
3:03 3:07 FEMALE: I know. We're gonna run out of time [unintelligible]. 
3:08 3:14 MALE: I know.  [unintelligible] quick.  Um, [unintelligible] listening to right now, okay.  The Shims. 
3:14 3:15 FEMALE: Okay. 
3:15 3:16 MALE: You know the Shims?
3:16 3:19 FEMALE: Yeah, from the Garden State soundtrack.  That's how I got into them. 
3:18 3:19 MALE: The Shims are awesome.
3:20 3:20 FEMALE: They're cool.
3:20 3:27 MALE: [unintelligible] every, single song.  Um, [unintelligible] Guster, their most new--newest album.
3:27 3:28 FEMALE: Okay. 
3:28 3:30 MALE: Um, all right.  You're gonna laugh at this one. 
3:30 3:31 FEMALE: I'm not. 
3:31 3:32 MALE: You ready?
3:32 3:32 FEMALE: Okay. 
3:33 3:33 MALE: Michael Jackson. 
3:34 3:41 FEMALE: Michael Jackson's great, although the whole trial thing is a bummer, but--and well, him being weird is a bummer. 
3:41 3:44 MALE: Yeah, but in terms of entertainment value and his music, it's just amazing. 
3:44 3:49 FEMALE: I have a record player.  My parents have thriller on LP.  Awesome. 
3:50 3:51 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
3:51 4:01 FEMALE: Um, not as much as I did in college.  Well, my parents come to see me a lot, but less now than they used to.  But it's nice to be so close that I can.  You know, sometimes when I'm sick or something, I'll be like, "I'm coming home." 
4:03 4:04 MALE: All right. 
4:04 4:05 FEMALE: It was nice meeting you.
4:05 4:08 MALE: You as well.  I'm gonna leave you my trash. 
4:10 4:17 FEMALE: So rude.  I'm putting that down.  Courteous, not. [laughter]  You can put it in the cup, probably.  That's not--[laughter]
