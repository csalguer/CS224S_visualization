0:02 0:02 FEMALE: male308.
0:08 0:08 MALE: female323, good to meet you.
0:05 0:06 FEMALE: Nice to meet you, too, male308.
0:13 0:17 MALE: Then again I have a microphone on my shoulders.	So I guess the handshake's getting used to it.
0:12 0:12 FEMALE: It's kind of embarrassing.
0:19 0:20 MALE: I know. So what do you, what are you studying?
0:16 0:21 FEMALE: I'm studying math education, same as nameX. If nameX told you what she does I do the same thing.
0:26 0:33 MALE: This is incredible. I've never met an inspired math educator before and now I have two back to back. Similar, did you just finish up the Masters program?
0:29 0:33 FEMALE: Well she is literally my best friend. We've spent every minute together so.
0:37 0:38 MALE: Oh Congratulations. What happens next here, Berkeley High?
0:34 0:37 FEMALE: No. I'm going to San Lorenzo High School.
0:40 0:41 MALE: Which is where?
0:38 0:42 FEMALE: Do you know Highway 92 sort of spits you out? In the east in San Lorenzo.
0:45 0:46 MALE: That's cool.
0:45 0:46 FEMALE: So it's the land of industrial parks.
0:49 0:51 MALE: I like industrial parks as you will soon.
0:47 0:50 FEMALE: So do I. The rents are real low, cavernous spaces.
0:55 0:56 MALE: That's saying something in California.
0:54 0:57 FEMALE: I'm actually not going to live over there. I'm in for a long drive but it's--
1:01 1:01 MALE: Where are you living?
0:58 0:58 FEMALE: In San Francisco.
1:02 1:06 MALE: Oh. You're really smart but good Lord, how long is the commute?
1:03 1:04 FEMALE: About 45 minutes, probably.
1:09 1:12 MALE: I like it; that's dedication. What part of San Francisco are you living in, do you know?
1:08 1:08 FEMALE: I don't know. 
1:14 1:15 MALE: Anything will be better than--
1:11 1:13 FEMALE: We have a-- I'm going to live with nameX and two other people so we have to find a--
1:17 1:19 MALE: Are the other folks from the education school?
1:15 1:15 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. They're math educators.
1:22 1:30 MALE: How does it work? Do you come in here and you pick your discipline within education? Did you all spend the entire year together?
1:26 1:32 FEMALE: Sort of. You have to pass a bunch of different tests to show that you are subject matter competent. 
1:36 1:39 MALE: With math I would get nowhere. I would be back on the street after the first day. 
1:34 1:34 FEMALE: Oh. You'll do fine.
1:40 1:40 MALE: No, no, no, no. 
1:37 1:46 FEMALE: Oh. So there's a whole bunch of people, there's 70 people in the step program, actually 69. So some of the teach English, some of them teach history, some of them teach math, foreign language and science.
1:49 1:52 MALE: This is the one where you get a California certificate. I remember hearing about it.
1:48 1:53 FEMALE: Yeah. The credential. So we spend a lot of time together but we also spend time just with our subjects.
1:56 1:57 MALE: That's pretty cool.
1:54 1:55 FEMALE: Are you in business school?
1:58 2:05 MALE: No. Law school. Oh no business school. I'm just kidding. So yeah, I just finished the second year so I'm working out. And I love it.
2:02 2:02 FEMALE: You really?
2:08 2:33 MALE: Honestly, it's the most interesting thing I've studied and it's such a cool program because it's really small, at least by my standards it's small. So you really get to know your professors. I came in here, I didn't know what I thought I was going to do. I just sort of thought, well surely law will open up some doors. And I really got interested in criminal law and that's something I never would have... But it's just getting to know professors and getting turned on to different things so...
2:29 2:30 FEMALE: Like defense or prosecution?
2:35 2:44 MALE: Probably prosecution and then I'd love to be a trial judge way, way, way down the road in 20, 30 years after it all.
2:39 2:42 FEMALE: So you have to specialize, right? You have to choose some sort of discipline within--
2:47 3:00 MALE: Within reason. If you're going to work for a firm and sort of like you deciding whether you're going to do transactional work like drafting contracts basically or litigation. And I do think I'll start out doing civil litigation for a few years.
2:55 2:56 FEMALE: Okay. So that's not criminal.
3:00 3:01 MALE: Pay off some debt and. Yeah. So it will be like--
2:58 2:58 FEMALE: So do you have to decide between criminal and civil?	
3:04 3:24 MALE: Not even because a lot of the firms will do white collar defense. If a company gets sued by the SEC, you would represent them in that. But also their Board of Directors who shredded evidence, that kind of thing. So hopefully that will be a good way to kind of start to get my feet wet before doing it kind of full time. Lot of changes too.
3:20 3:21 FEMALE: I took a business law class in college.
3:27 3:27 MALE: How did you like it? Did you do good?
3:21 3:26 FEMALE: And I loved it. I loved it. I even took the LSAT, I was thinking about going to law school.
3:29 3:35 MALE: Well good Lord, that's like the hardest part, honestly. So what happened? How did you end up in education? Did you do it straight through or did you--
3:32 3:39 FEMALE: No. I worked for a while. I worked for Lucent Technologies and then I worked for a couple of years for Arista Records.
3:42 3:44 MALE: Oh wow. What did you do for Arista Records?
3:42 3:42 FEMALE: I did international marketing.
3:47 3:56 MALE: I did product management marketing, as well. I was working for Microsoft up in the Seattle area. Your product was much sexier than mine, let me assure you.
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: It depends. After they airbrush them maybe.
3:59 4:01 MALE: Okay. Yeah, yeah. [laughter]
3:55 4:01 FEMALE: After they cut out the love handles and brush away the moles.
4:05 4:13 MALE: I was marketing to software developers and software development technology. Even so, that's pretty interesting though. I'll think about that.
4:09 4:09 FEMALE: Do you know Pink?
4:14 4:14 MALE: Yeah. Not so attractive?
4:11 4:20 FEMALE: She's chubby. She's fat and they would literally cut her hips, she's very square. It was really interesting.
4:24 4:28 MALE: I have problems with that on so many levels though, you know but that's the industry.
4:24 4:27 FEMALE: Anybody who doesn't really do that is really sort of foolish though. It's a business.
4:30 4:31 MALE: You're right, totally. It was really good meeting you. Congratulations, wow.
4:29 4:31 FEMALE: Oh sorry. It was good to meet you, too male308.
