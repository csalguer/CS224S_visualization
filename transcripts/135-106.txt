1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:54 1:57 MALE:  I think everyone from Berkley says that.

2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  We'll see.  
2:56 3:01 MALE:  I think they've figured it out now that I'm leaning towards not coming back.  
2:56 2:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, so what are you going to do after your Maser's?
3:04 3:14 MALE:  I've actually applied for a PhD to a few places, but I'm not completely sure that's what I want to do, and I'm not sure where I'll go because one place actually hasn't gotten back to me yet.

3:32 3:34 FEMALE:  Right.  You should go straight in to your doctorate.  
3:39 3:41 MALE:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah, where do you think you're going to want to stay?  
3:38 3:43 FEMALE:  I'll go anywhere depending on where I get a job.  
3:47 3:51 MALE:  Yeah, you don't have much choice when you're trying to be a professor.  
3:47 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly. Like, I mean especially because I study higher education, and there weren't that many programs.
