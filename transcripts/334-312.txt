0:00 0:01 FEMALE: Extensive. 
0:00 0:01 MALE: [laughter]
0:04 0:04 FEMALE: Hey. 
0:03 0:04 MALE: Nice to meet you.
0:05 0:05 FEMALE: Nice to meet you. 
0:05 0:06 MALE: Does that say Stanford Immunology?
0:07 0:09 FEMALE: It does.  I'm in the Immunology program. 
0:08 0:09 MALE: What does that entail?
0:11 0:12 FEMALE: Well, your name?  male312?
0:11 0:12 MALE: male312, yes. 
0:12 0:28 FEMALE: female334.  Yeah, so it's basically studying the immune system.  So, like, things that go wrong with it.  What happens when it attacks itself or get a disease, um, how it responds or how it develops.  Actually, yeah.  I focus on--oh, go ahead. 
0:27 0:32 MALE: I just had an awful head cold.  They would not give me any antibiotics for it [unintelligible]. 
0:33 0:36 FEMALE: Well, that's because it would've been--
0:33 0:40 MALE: [laughter] And, and they gave me this speech that, like, I was--that I would be degrading the quality of the antibiotics if I used them, and-- [laughter]
0:41 0:47 FEMALE: Well, you d--well, like, it wouldn't do any good because antibiotics don't work against colds because it's a virus and--
0:45 0:46 MALE: Okay. Got it. 
0:48 0:49 FEMALE: Anyway, so--
0:48 0:49 MALE: Well, that's something I didn't know.
0:51 1:06 FEMALE: Well, the reason is because, um, they work against bacteria because bacteria are much more complicated and got a lot more intercellular, um, organs and a lot more dynamics to, um, interfere with, but virus--
1:04 1:07 MALE: What causes--but what causes a cold?  A vi--so a virus?
1:08 1:08 FEMALE: Yes. 
1:08 1:09 MALE: And any antibiotics wor--work against bacteria?
1:11 1:17 FEMALE: Right because a virus is basically just, like, um, instructions as to how to attack you. 
1:16 1:17 MALE: Okay.
1:18 1:22 FEMALE: And then, like, an envelope, and that's it.  Like, there's nothing there. So--
1:20 1:23 MALE: Then who--then what, what takes that and, like, makes you sick?
1:25 1:32 FEMALE: So what happens usually is it infects one of your cells, and the instructions tell your body--
1:28 1:34 MALE: Okay.  Oh, [unintelligible] tell how to screw you over? [laughter] Okay. 
1:33 1:36 FEMALE: Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  So that's what it does. 
1:35 1:35 MALE: I got it. 
1:36 1:40 FEMALE: So it just has this protective coating, and then just the instructions. 
1:38 1:39 MALE: They didn't tell me that.  
1:42 1:42 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:40 1:42 MALE: They must've thought I couldn't figure it out.
1:43 1:46 FEMALE: So, like, if you--if you take antibiotics when you're not supposed to--
1:45 1:45 MALE: Yeah. 
1:47 1:49 FEMALE: You'll develop a resistance to them.
1:48 1:48 MALE: Okay. 
1:49 1:51 FEMALE: And then you can spread that to other people. 
1:50 1:50 MALE: Got it. 
1:51 1:55 FEMALE: And then antibiotics in general just don't work as well. 
1:54 1:55 MALE: Okay.  [unintelligible]. 
1:56 2:02 FEMALE: Oh, it's all right.  It's a common--it's a common mistake.  They don't really explain it to the, the people very well. 
1:59 2:07 MALE: Yeah, I know.  They were just like, "You know, we don't want to dilute the population, and you can deal with it, you know.  Give it a week or something."  So I'm in the business school.
2:09 2:11 FEMALE: Okay.  Are you doing an MBA, then?
2:09 2:11 MALE: I am, yeah.  Doing an MBA, first year. 
2:13 2:14 FEMALE: I'm a first-year, also. 
2:13 2:14 MALE: Oh, you are?  
2:15 2:15 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:14 2:15 MALE: Cool.  Where are you from?
2:16 2:19 FEMALE: Um, yeah, I'm from Minnesota, actually.  Thank you. 
2:18 2:19 MALE: Oh, nice.  My brother's moving to Minneapolis.
2:21 2:23 FEMALE: Oh, I'm from Minneapolis. 
2:21 2:22 MALE: Are you from Minneapolis?  
2:23 2:23 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:22 2:23 MALE: Must be a great place.
2:25 2:27 FEMALE: It is.  It's one of those small big cities. 
2:25 2:26 MALE: Yeah. 
2:28 2:34 FEMALE: Um, so it's got all the, the cool things that you find in a--in a big city, like, the theaters and the culture and everything. 
2:32 2:34 MALE: Yeah. But it's not like, congested--
2:35 2:37 FEMALE: But people are really nice.  No. 
2:35 2:39 MALE: And expensive.  He actually just called me.  So him and--he's getting married in June out here.
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: Um hm. 
2:40 2:42 MALE: Him and his wife are moving there.  She's working for Target. 
2:43 2:44 FEMALE: Okay. 
2:43 2:44 MALE: And they just found--
2:45 2:46 FEMALE: Yeah, they're based there, aren't they? 
2:44 2:51 MALE: Yeah, they're based there. And they just found a loft, like, ridiculous apartment with, you know, cement floors for, like, $1,200.
2:53 2:53 FEMALE: I know. 
2:52 2:55 MALE: I'm like, "Oh, my God."  I, I've been out here for five years. 
2:57 2:58 FEMALE: Are you originally from here?
2:57 2:58 MALE: No, I'm from upstate New York. 
3:00 3:00 FEMALE: Upstate New York?
2:59 3:06 MALE: But I went to school in the East and came back out--came out here for school.  I've been out here for Stanford.  So, like, the cost-of-living issue--
3:08 3:09 FEMALE: Is--yeah. 
3:08 3:12 MALE: Like, holy.  You know, for $1,200 in the city, you get, like, something marginal. 
3:15 3:15 FEMALE: Right. 
3:13 3:16 MALE: Now, here we got this great loft.  It's going to be so [unintelligible]. 
3:18 3:19 FEMALE: That's part of the appeal. 
3:17 3:17 MALE: Yeah. 
3:20 3:21 FEMALE: And that, and my family's from there, too. 
3:20 3:21 MALE: Yeah.  Are you gonna go back there after school, you think?
3:23 3:27 FEMALE: I think I might eventually.  Um, with the graduate program, it's, like, five years. 
3:26 3:26 MALE: Okay. 
3:28 3:33 FEMALE: And then I might go back there afterwards.  In order to get a job as a professor, you have to--
3:31 3:33 MALE: You get placed, right?  Yeah. 
3:34 3:43 FEMALE: Yeah, you have to do a, a--well, like three-years or so of research between the time when you get your PhD and the time when you want to start.  And that's called you post-doc. 
3:42 3:43 MALE: Got it. 
3:45 3:46 FEMALE: And so I'm not--
3:43 3:45 MALE: So, wait.  Why immunology?
3:47 3:49 FEMALE: Well, you know, it give me a good--
3:47 3:48 MALE: Your parents in medicine?
3:50 3:52 FEMALE: No, actually, my dad's computer science. 
3:50 3:51 MALE: Okay. 
3:53 3:56 FEMALE: My mom's in business, so completely out of the field. 
3:55 3:55 MALE: Okay. 
3:57 4:04 FEMALE: Yeah, it gives me a chance to help people, and immunology--oh. All right, male312. 
4:03 4:04 MALE: Well, we'll just finish quickly.  I'm just gonna--I'm here. 
4:05 4:08 FEMALE: Immunology was--it, it combines everything else. 
4:07 4:08 MALE: It's interdisciplinary, you mean?
4:10 4:11 FEMALE: Yeah, it's very nice. 
4:09 4:11 MALE: Okay. Cool.  It was nice to meet you.
4:12 4:13 FEMALE: It was nice to meet you. 
4:11 4:12 MALE: Okay.  Take care. 
4:13 4:14 FEMALE: Okay.
