0:02 0:02	  FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:03 0:04	  MALE: Nice to meet you, too. 
0:05 0:05	  FEMALE: So.
0:05 0:06	  MALE: I'll just start. I'm an MS and E major here.
0:07 0:07	  FEMALE: You're what?
0:08 0:08	  MALE: MS and E.
0:09 0:09	  FEMALE: What is that?
0:09 0:10	  MALE: Management Science and Engineering.
0:10 0:12	  FEMALE: Management, Science and-- So what school is that in?
0:13 0:14	  MALE: School of engineering.
0:15 0:15	  FEMALE: School of engineering.
0:15 0:16	  MALE: [unintelligible]
0:16 0:18	  FEMALE: Okay. And what are you doing, your PhD or...?
0:18 0:21	  MALE: No. I'm doing a Masters program here. I don't have the patience for a PhD.
0:22 0:22	  FEMALE: No?
0:23 0:23	  MALE: NO.
0:23 0:25	  FEMALE: [laughter] Well how much patience does it take to get a Masters?
0:25 0:27	  MALE: Well it's only a year's...
0:29 0:29	  FEMALE: It's a year?
0:30 0:36	  MALE: Well I'm doing two years because I didn't want to work all that hard I guess. My friends will finish quick. It's just I'm here in California.
0:36 0:39	  FEMALE: Enjoying the finer things that California has to offer?
0:40 0:40	  MALE: Absolutely.
0:41 0:41	  FEMALE: Well, that's important.
0:42 0:43	  MALE: Yes. How long are we going to be, I don't know.
0:43 0:44	  FEMALE: So you're just finishing your first year?
0:45 0:46	  MALE: Yes.
0:46 0:48	  FEMALE: Is it a thesis program or just a coursework program?
0:49 0:53	  MALE: Coursework and we have some project courses that we have to do instead of thesis. But I'm just doing a lot of projects.
0:53 0:55	  FEMALE: Okay. But it's not really a thesis, it's a project.
0:55 1:05	  MALE: Project courses. Not like one project that you have to submit but like a bunch of project courses in different areas that you have to complete over two years. It's up to you what you really want to do. 
1:06 1:07	  FEMALE: That's interesting.
1:07 1:08	  MALE: How about you?
1:08 1:12	  FEMALE: I'm studying math education. I'm going to be a high school math teacher.
1:14 1:14	  MALE: Oh. Okay.
1:16 1:16         FEMALE: So interesting.
1:18 1:18	  MALE: Math is not one of my strengths.
1:19 1:19	  FEMALE: Really? An engineer?
1:20 1:23	  MALE: No, it was but not really. It was only enough.
1:23 1:24	  FEMALE: Did you just not like it?
1:25 1:32	  MALE: I do love numbers I just got tired of doing all the numbers; too many formulas and--
1:32 1:33	  FEMALE: Okay. Where did you go undergrad?
1:35 1:36	  MALE: India, I was a CS major.
1:37 1:39	  FEMALE: Okay. So how long have you been in the States?
1:40 1:42	  MALE: Not much. I came here in September.
1:42 1:44	  FEMALE: Oh. So you're new?	
1:45 1:45	  MALE: Very new.
1:46 1:47	  FEMALE: No wonder you're goofing off. Good for you. [laughter]
1:48 1:50	  MALE: That's right. 
1:50 1:52	  FEMALE: All right. Do you like it so far?
1:53 1:53	  MALE: Oh yes.
1:54 1:55	  FEMALE: You came to the best state, I think.
1:56 1:56	  MALE: Yeah. That's what a lot of people--
1:57 1:57	  FEMALE: Maybe Hawaii, actually might be better.
1:58 2:00	  MALE: Yeah. But I'm not sure how well--
2:00 2:00	  FEMALE: No good engineering programs here.
2:04 2:04	  MALE: Not engineering programs.
2:04 2:04	  FEMALE: That's an angle.
2:08 2:09	  MALE: This is access to a lot of other places.
2:10 2:10	  FEMALE: You what?
2:11 2:13	  MALE: I just like this place. I like hiking and going around.
2:13 2:14	  FEMALE: Okay. Where do you go hiking?
2:14 2:17	  MALE: Anywhere that my friends take me. I don't have a car so.
2:17 2:18	  FEMALE: You don't have a car?
2:19 2:20	  MALE: Yeah. So I have lots of friends with cars.
2:21 2:23	  FEMALE: Okay. Do you feel sort of isolated on campus without a car?
2:24 2:24	  MALE: Yes. Sometimes.
2:25 2:27	  FEMALE: That is really bizarre. Everybody drives here everywhere but.
2:28 2:38	  MALE: I was like used to a very good public transport system, I guess. It's difficult to get around here.
2:38 2:40	  FEMALE: Yeah. It is very inconvenient to get places without a car here.
2:42 2:45	  MALE: So what brought you here to speed dating?
2:46 2:48	  FEMALE: Oh. What brought me here to the dating thing?
2:49 2:50	  MALE: Yeah. Do you like to do a lot of dates?
2:51 3:09	  FEMALE: No. I had a flyer on my door, I thought it was an omen. You know? Like a weird green flyer stuck on my door knob. No, I don't know. I like going on dates but I haven't done a lot of dating now. I'm just sort of been very wrapped up in my education and everything.
3:10 3:15	  MALE: So it's more because of where we are that people are-- when I came here I just want to be single for a while.
3:16 3:16	  FEMALE: Why is that?
3:17 3:20	  MALE: I just broke off back in India.
3:21 3:21	  FEMALE: Oh. So did you have to leave her in India?
3:23 3:23	  MALE: Yeah.
3:24 3:27	  FEMALE: That's hard. That's too far to do the long distance thing, huh?
3:31 3:31	  MALE: Yeah.
3:32 3:37	  FEMALE: Yeah. I don't know. I like people, I like meeting people it's just you have another thing to worry about. It's just too much sometimes.
3:37 3:46	  MALE: I agree. If you're on the same wavelength you understand people. Otherwise it's you don't have time for me, you're too busy with work.
3:47 3:51	  FEMALE: You ignore me. Yeah. That's too much of a problem.
3:54 3:54	  MALE: So where do you hang out for fun?
3:55 4:03	  FEMALE: We hang out in Paolo Alto because it's kind of boring. [horn] This is the loudest seat.
4:03 4:03	  MALE: Four minutes.
4:05 4:05	  FEMALE: Well nice to meet you.  Are we seriously not done?
