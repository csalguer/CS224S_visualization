0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  Okay, good to meet you.  
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  How's your night going?
0:08 0:10 MALE:  Okay, it's going well.  It's fun.  It's number-
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Sixteen. 
0:11 0:12 MALE:  Yeah, sixteen.
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  We're getting up there.
0:13 0:14 MALE:  That's right.  Yeah, it's almost over.
0:34 0:35 FEMALE:  What do you think?
0:15 0:24 MALE:  I think it's interesting.  I've never done anything like this.  It's funny cause like I got roped into it by my friend, and he doesn't even show up.  Like, he was the guy we were waiting on at the beginning.  
0:44 0:44 FEMALE:  Is that-
0:26 0:26 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  He owes you.
0:27 0:29 MALE:  He does.  He ditched me, big time.
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  He better have a good excuse, right?
0:32 0:37 MALE:  He was trying to get back to campus.  He was like--he went off campus trying to buy something for someone--like he was buying bike parts.  
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Uh-oh.
0:38 0:38 MALE:  From somebody on [unintelligible].
0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  He got held up.
0:39 0:43 MALE:  Yeah, I kind of feel bad too because now everyone waited.  
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  Whatever. 
0:46 0:46 MALE:  Out of control.
1:06 1:12 FEMALE:  Nobody has to know you knew him.  So, what are you studying?
0:52 0:53 MALE:  Electrical engineering.  
1:14 1:14 FEMALE:  Another engineer.
0:55 0:57 MALE:  Are there a lot of us?  I imagine there are.
1:17 1:18 FEMALE:  There were a bunch at the beginning.  
0:58 0:59 MALE:  Oh, really?
1:19 1:21 FEMALE:  I had a break from the engineers for a while, but I've heard that they're-
1:02 1:02 MALE:  [interposing]  They're better aren't they?
1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  --filling in engineers.  
1:04 1:05 MALE:  Well, yeah, like it might [unintelligible].
1:25 1:27 FEMALE: Like 800 electrical engineers.  
1:07 1:09 MALE: Yeah, 200 every year.
1:29 1:31 FEMALE: Oh, is it 200 per year--it's 800 total?
1:12 1:15 MALE: Yeah, it's not 800 total per year.
1:35 1:37 FEMALE: Okay, I must have misunderstood a while ago.
1:17 1:17 MALE: Okay.
1:37 1:42 FEMALE: I thought he said 800 new Master's students. 
1:24 1:26 MALE:  Unless it's the whole engineering department.  
1:46 1:48 FEMALE: That a lot of electrical engineers.
1:28 1:28 MALE: Yeah.
1:48 1:49 FEMALE: Is this your first year?
1:30 1:31 MALE: No, I'm a fifth year.
1:51 1:52 FEMALE: All right, you're almost done, huh?
1:32 1:33 MALE: Yeah, we'll see. 
1:54 1:55 FEMALE: And then what's going to happen?
1:35 1:37 MALE: I want to find a job in industry.
1:57 1:57 FEMALE: Great.
1:38 1:40 MALE: A lot of exciting things happening there.  
2:01 2:01 FEMALE: Out here?
1:41 1:47 MALE: Yeah, yeah, it's a fast-paced kind of environment.  I feel like I've been in the university area so long-
2:08 2:10 FEMALE: [interposing]  Yeah, it's time to do something different.  
1:50 1:50 MALE: Yeah, totally.  
2:11 2:13 FEMALE: So you want to stay around here, and-
1:53 1:53 MALE: [interposing]  I think so.
2:14 2:15 FEMALE: Okay, you grew up here?
1:55 1:58 MALE: I grew up in Southern California.  How about you?
2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  San Diego?
2:00 2:00 MALE: Orange county. 
2:20 2:20 FEMALE: Okay. 
2:01 2:01 MALE: You know the area?
2:22 2:24 FEMALE: Yeah, a little bit. 
2:04 2:05 MALE: Huntington Beach?
2:26 2:26 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:06 2:06 MALE: Okay.
2:28 2:30 FEMALE: No, I actually grew up in Houston.
2:10 2:10 MALE: Okay.
2:31 2:34 FEMALE: Just moved out here from Boston because I'm doing the one-year Master's in the ed school.  
2:14 2:15 MALE: Okay, at which school?
2:36 2:36 FEMALE: Here, the ed school. 
2:16 2:19 MALE: Oh, okay, all right, is that how you found out about it?
2:39 2:44 FEMALE: I'm actually in nameX's class.  He recruited.
2:24 2:26 MALE: Some other people said the same thing to me, yeah.  
2:47 2:53 FEMALE: We're in class together. So, you're like all right.  
2:33 2:38 MALE: Does that like make extra pressure because now you kind of--are you-
2:58 2:59 FEMALE:  Because my professor is like-
2:39 2:39 MALE: [interposing]  Yeah.
3:00 3:01 FEMALE: I don't care.
2:41 2:46 MALE:  You don't care?  [laughter] I wonder what he's going to use it for?
3:07 3:08 FEMALE: Research.
2:48 2:50 MALE: I'd be interested to see the results. 
3:10 3:14 FEMALE: Yeah, me too.  I mean--yeah, I don't know what they're looking for.
2:55 3:03 MALE: Yeah, but it doesn't even seem to do with education as far as I understand it.  It seems to be more like a psych experiment.  
3:23 3:24 FEMALE: Well, he's an OB person, so...
3:04 3:06 MALE: Does that mean psych?
3:27 3:28 FEMALE: Organizational behavior.  
3:09 3:10 MALE: Oh, okay.  
3:32 3:41 FEMALE: I just came actually from another class that I'm taking on diversity talking about like [unintelligible] assumption and how people think that's, you know, without quickly [unintelligible].  
3:21 3:21 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:42 3:51 FEMALE:  I'm like yes, but the whole point of deviating is that you can determine whether you would want to spend more time with somebody based on just a short amount of-
3:31 3:32 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, yeah.  
3:52 3:52 FEMALE:  You know, so.
3:33 3:34 MALE: How much pressure?
3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  Ah, what else do you have to do with yourself, right? 
3:38 3:40 MALE: Nothing, I just wanted to try it. 
4:00 4:03 FEMALE: Hey, no harm, none at all.  Well, have fun.
3:43 3:45 MALE:  Yeah, good to meet you.
