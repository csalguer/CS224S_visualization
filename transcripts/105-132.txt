0:03 0:06 MALE:  [unintelligible] I don't know.  

0:06 0:07 FEMALE:  [laughter]

0:07 0:15 MALE:  That's kind of hard.  I'm assuming that your  name has some sort of French influence, if that makes sense.

0:15 0:17 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:18 0:18 MALE:  Uh--

0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:21 0:21 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:22 0:22 FEMALE:  female132.

0:22 0:22 MALE:  female132.

0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:24 0:24 MALE:  Beautiful.

0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Okay [unintelligible] 

0:26 0:29 MALE:  And the only reason I could tell was because of the [unintelligible] is that--

0:29 0:31 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Actually [unintelligible] 

0:31 0:31 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:32 0:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:34 0:34 MALE:  Yeah.

0:35 0:36 FEMALE:  [laughter]

0:35 0:38 MALE:  I did--I did French in high school and that's about the extent of what I can remember.

0:39 0:43 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] dig out those old memories.

0:43 1:02 MALE:  I know I've got to kick them out of there because once they get kind of rusty it takes a while to get it started again.  When, um, whenever I go to visit my family down in Mexico, or my cousins, for the first three days I'm sitting here like thinking about what I want to say and then half the time I'll start speaking English and they're like, what.  

1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  [laughter]

1:04 1:13 MALE:  And then after I've been down there for two weeks, come back, the first words out of my mouth are in Spanish.  And my friends are like, what are you talking about?  Oh yeah, sorry.  Got to think about it for a while again.

1:15 1:23 FEMALE:  That happened to me when I came back from France.  I was on the train [unintelligible] [laughter]

1:23 1:23 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:24 1:27 FEMALE:  And I [unintelligible] 

1:27 1:30 MALE:  [unintelligible] to blame it on.  Very nice.  What part of France?

1:31 1:34 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

1:34 1:34 MALE:  Okay.  

1:35 1:35 FEMALE:  Like--

1:35 1:39 MALE:  I've been to France once and I'm sure you can guess the one place I went to when I was there.

1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  Let me guess, does it begin with a P?

1:42 1:43 MALE:  Yes, how did you know?  [laughter]

1:43 1:44 FEMALE:  Does it end with S?  

1:44 1:44 MALE:  Yes.

1:45 1:48 FEMALE:  Oh my [unintelligible] [laughter]

1:47 1:50 MALE:  [laughter]

1:50 1:50 FEMALE:  So which program are you in?

1:51 1:52 MALE:  Mechanical engineering.

1:52 1:52 FEMALE:  What year?

1:53 1:55 MALE:  I am a first year masters student so--

1:55 1:56 FEMALE:  Oh.

1:56 1:58 MALE:  --working towards my PhD.  What about you?

1:58 2:02 FEMALE:  I am a third year PhD un [unintelligible] 

2:03 2:06 MALE:  Oh nice.  I have met three of you from the school of education so far.

2:07 2:11 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  [unintelligible] [laughter]

2:11 2:14 MALE:  [laughter]  So what are you studying?

2:15 2:24 FEMALE:  Um, it depends on the year.  It depends on [unintelligible] [laughter]

2:21 2:32 MALE:  [laughter]  Okay.  I've changed my area several times.  So how do you like California as opposed to France?

2:33 2:52 FEMALE:  Um, well they're very different, you know.  Like [unintelligible] in France we have [unintelligible] out here, you know it's sunshine, [unintelligible] and big SUVs. 

2:52 2:56 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although I found out they lied about the rain before I came out here.

2:57 2:57 FEMALE:  Oh.

2:58 3:03 MALE:  I always imagined, you know, sunny California, always sunny and then you get winter and it rains every time.  

3:04 3:08 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] they do, they have the rainy season.

3:08 3:10 MALE:  Yes.  I'm from, uh, New Mexico.

3:10 3:10 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

3:11 3:27 MALE:  So middle of the desert.  I'm used to my beautiful brown landscapes and getting rain twice a year.  And so I come here and it's like it's raining.  There was one of the guys from the Midwest was saying it's so dry here.  How can--how can people tolerate it?  And I'm sitting there going it's not dry.  

3:27 3:28 FEMALE:  [laughter]

3:28 3:33 MALE:  [laughter]  Really, it rains every other day.  How can it be dry?  So--

3:33 3:35 FEMALE:  I've always [unintelligible] 

3:35 3:36 MALE:  Oh, absolutely.

3:36 3:37 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]  
 
3:37 3:41 MALE:  [unintelligible] if you're gonna--you need to check the Grand Canyon.  I would say that that's kind of a--

3:41 3:46 FEMALE:  I've been to the Grand Canyon [unintelligible] Arizona [unintelligible] 

3:46 4:00 MALE:  And then in New Mexico, white sand, it's beautiful, just pure white sand dunes as far as the eye can see.  And if you get a chance to stay overnight, um, particularly on a full moon, the--the--the ground glows.  It is awesome.

4:00 4:00 FEMALE:  Really?

4:01 4:07 MALE:  It is so awesome.  But then you end up getting rained on and you know that's okay.  It was really, really fun.

4:07 4:07 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

4:09 4:09 MALE:  Have a good one.

4:10 4:11 FEMALE:  [laughter]  It was nice meeting you.

4:10 4:11 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
