1:24 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh, oh, really.  Oh, that's okay, I don't really care about it again, that's cool.
1:30 1:31 MALE:  So you're saying Boston?
1:31 1:33 FEMALE:  Um, I'm from Missouri.
1:33 1:34 MALE:  Oh, Missouri, okay, gotcha.

1:36 1:37 MALE:  St. Louis, or?
1:36 1:37 FEMALE:  Yes.
1:37 1:38 MALE:  Okay.
1:37 1:41 FEMALE:  Meet me in St Louie.  It's that song, but.

1:48 1:49 MALE:  Oh, okay.
1:49 1:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, we'll put it all across the country.
1:52 1:54 MALE:  How did you like Boston? That was a change from Missouri.
1:54 2:02 FEMALE:  Oh, well, I love it.  I mean, I loved the school I was at and the people and the culture.  And the weather could have been better but, it'd made for some good stories.
2:03 2:08 MALE:  Oh, definitely, I'm, accustomed to shitty weather, so coming here was a nice uh, nice change from that.
2:05 2:11 FEMALE:  Oh, yes, yes.  Did you come, uh, do undergrad here in the States?
2:11 2:16 MALE:  I did undergrad in Canada.  So we don't move around a lot in Canada so much, it's too cold to move.
2:15 2:18 FEMALE:  I see, I see.  Um, bundled in those igloos, so yes.
2:18 2:19 MALE:  Yeah, exactly, so.
2:20 2:22 FEMALE:  So you're doing um PhD?
2:22 2:23 MALE:  PhD in geophysics.
2:23 2:25 FEMALE:  Geophysics.  Oh, I met another geophysics [unintelligible].
2:25 2:27 MALE:  Yeah, nameX, he's in my group.
2:27 2:27 FEMALE:  Oh.
2:27 2:28 MALE:  Another guy in my group knows nameX [phonetic].
2:28 2:31 FEMALE:  Oh, I see, I see.  I know nameX too, she's like my roommate's friend and I'm like...
2:32 2:33 MALE:  Oh, okay, what, what program are you in?
2:34 2:39 FEMALE:  Uh, the master's program in product design in the engineering department, mechanical engineering department.
2:40 2:44 MALE:  I think I know some people in that, right?  I knew people in that, I think they probably left at this point.
2:44 2:48 FEMALE:  Probably left, yeah, yeah.  It's a full program, it's only two years though, so yeah, they do come and go.
2:49 2:53 MALE:  That's true, but it sounds like fun.  So, so do you focus on, I, I always wondered about that program, do you focus on a particular type of product?
2:54 2:58 FEMALE:  No, no, it's so broad you could probably focus on like, twirling your toes the whole time and you would probably get by.
2:59 3:02 MALE:  A professional, have a toe twiddling device that you could design.
3:01 3:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, you totally could.  I think that's a good idea.  I'm going to make a thumb twiddling, yeah, that great.
3:07 3:10 MALE:  Got little strings or something put together that would, yeah, there you go.
3:10 3:17 FEMALE:  See that's the stuff I would probably make again.  So somebody else could twiddle my thumbs for me.  [laughter].  Sounds great.
3:17 3:19 MALE:  Something that really helps you twiddle the thumbs, yeah.
3:18 3:29 FEMALE:  Yeah.   My products are kind of, I, yeah, I just.  Like I want to make this ceramic, you know how those like Chinese, like; tea cups and things are like that white and blue looking?
3:30 3:34 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, I was in China we, just got back from a trip, well, over spring break, Japan and China.
3:34 3:35 FEMALE:  Did you buy one of those tea pots?
3:35 3:38 MALE:  I bought these little portable things, they're fantastic.  So it's like a thermos.
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:39 3:48 MALE:  And you put loose leaf tea in it and there's a mesh thing on top that pops out.  So you put in your tea, hot water, mesh, and drink.  And it's just, it like--
3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  It's great, like mixes it and everything.
3:49 3:57 MALE:  It's perfect because you always have it steeping.  So like, green tea it's perfect and it filters out all the actual leafs when you drink it and caps it.
3:57 4:05 FEMALE:  Cool, well I want to make this baseball bat that's out of that ceramic material with like, little, like blue flowers and crap because it's going to look so funny.
4:05 4:07 MALE:  That would look quite cool, yeah.
4:06 4:07 FEMALE:  Because you'll never use it.
4:08 4:10 MALE:  Exactly completely useless, it's an ornament.
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  Exactly.
4:10 4:11 MALE:  I can appreciate that.
