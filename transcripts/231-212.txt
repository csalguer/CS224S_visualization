0:21 0:26 FEMALE: So what's--I don't know.  I feel like there's got to be a better intro than you know, so which department are you in.

0:32 0:35 MALE: What, what is your favorite city in the entire world?

0:29 0:36 FEMALE: In the entire world?  Ooh, that's a hard question.  Um, why don't I give you a favorite spot.

0:42 0:43 MALE: Okay.  

0:37 0:45 FEMALE: In a city that's probably not anybody's favorite city.  In Cologne, Germany, just outside of the train station.  I don't know if you've ever been to Cologne?

0:51 0:52 MALE: I haven't, but I want to.

0:46 0:48 FEMALE: So just outside of the train station is this great big huge cathedral.

0:54 0:55 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

0:49 0:51 FEMALE: Um and that's one of my favorite spots in the world.

0:57 0:58 MALE: Oh, nice.

0:52 1:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  So it's just--there are lots of interesting people around, and, you know, I have some nice memories of like that was a spot where I would meet up with friends, you know.

1:06 1:08 MALE: So you studied abroad in Germany then?

1:02 1:04 FEMALE: I studied abroad in Germany a while ago.

1:10 1:11 MALE: Oh okay, cool.

1:05 1:11 FEMALE: So, and it was, you know, that was a spot where we--we would meet just outside the train station by the cathedral steps, you know, to like hang out in Cologne for a day.

1:16 1:18 MALE: Like, meet me at the cathedral.

1:12 1:14 FEMALE: Exactly.  Just kind of cool, so.

1:20 1:23 MALE: Yeah.  That's fun.  I, I studied abroad in France myself.

1:17 1:18 FEMALE: Oh really?

1:24 1:25 MALE: I never made it to Germany, so.

1:19 1:20 FEMALE: Where in France were you?

1:26 1:27 MALE: Um Paris mostly, but--

1:20 1:21 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:27 1:31 MALE: It was with a history group, so we studied French history from, you know, beginning to--

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Oh okay.

1:31 1:33 MALE: --present day.

1:26 1:27 FEMALE: Cool.

1:33 1:42 MALE: So we went to, like, you know, Normandy and like um, what, uh Verdun and all the different battlefields, I guess.  We went with, like, a military historian, so I--

1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:42 1:47 MALE: I learned, like, more than anyone would ever really care to know about the French military tradition.

1:40 1:41 FEMALE: The world war.

1:47 1:49 MALE: Or lack thereof, but.

1:43 1:44 FEMALE: That's cool.  Are you a Don Quixote fan?

1:50 1:53 MALE: Oh yeah, actually I read the book back in high school.
 
1:47 1:48 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:54 1:59 MALE: And supposedly it's one of those books that you can, like, read at different stages of your life and discover different things or something.  I--

1:53 1:55 FEMALE: Have you tried it again then?  

2:01 2:02 MALE: Not yet.

1:55 1:56 FEMALE: Have you tried reading it again?  Okay.  

2:02 2:04 MALE: I've been sort of waiting for the right time.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Fair enough.

2:04 2:06 MALE: It's really cool.  Have you read it or--?

2:00 2:03 FEMALE: I haven't, although the musical is actually one of my favorite--

2:10 2:11 MALE: Man of La Mancha?

2:04 2:05 FEMALE: Man of La Mancha.

2:11 2:12 MALE: I haven't seen the musical actually.

2:06 2:08 FEMALE: I'm a huge musical theatre fan.

2:14 2:15 MALE: Oh really.

2:09 2:11 FEMALE: So yeah.  So I've seen my fair share of musicals, and it's, it's really wonderful.

2:17 2:24 MALE: I actually flew back, like I made a special trip to fly back home this February just to see Bernstein's Candide.

2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Oh really.

2:24 2:27 MALE: Which is being produced in like, the school of opera at my old university.

2:21 2:22 FEMALE: Where, where was that?

2:27 2:29 MALE: University of Illinois in Champagne.

2:23 2:24 FEMALE: Oh okay.

2:30 2:41 MALE: So it--they do, like, all these programs, like every year, and then they finally do Candide the year I leave, and I'm like--I love Candide, you know, like Bernstein is a god among men or something.  And so I--

2:35 2:36 FEMALE: That's excellent.

2:41 2:44 MALE: I flew back and met up with some of my friends and [unintelligible].

2:39 2:47 FEMALE: That's a great reason to go back.  I'm actually--I'm, I'm going to New York for a conference, um and I'm actually going a weekend early so I can try to hit a couple of musicals while I'm there.  So--

2:54 2:55 MALE: That's cool.  Yeah.  

2:48 2:49 FEMALE: Which I think'll be fun.

2:55 2:58 MALE: And I guess Spamalot is having its original cast.

2:52 2:58 FEMALE: Yes, very good.  Spamalot is on my list and um, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.  They did a music--they've done a musical production of it.

3:04 3:05 MALE: Cool.

2:58 3:01 FEMALE: So those are the two I'd really like to see while I'm there.

3:07 3:09 MALE: Yeah.  Like Spamalot premiered in, like, Chicago--

3:03 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:09 3:14 MALE: --where they did, like, the testing there, and I tried desperately to get tickets over winter break, but they were all sold out, and I was like--

3:08 3:09 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:15 3:19 MALE: And I will never see David Hyde Pierce do his, you know, do his stuff.

3:13 3:16 FEMALE: They did the pre-Broadway run of Wicked in San Francisco.

3:22 3:23 MALE: Oh really?

3:17 3:19 FEMALE: So I'm waiting for, like, something else really cool to come back through, but--

3:25 3:26 MALE: Yeah.  

3:20 3:22 FEMALE: --nothing has yet.  I just moved here in September, so.

3:28 3:29 MALE: Oh.

3:23 3:24 FEMALE: I'm still pretty new to the area.  So.

3:30 3:32 MALE: That's cool.  Yeah I haven't really done as much things in the downtown area as I'd like.

3:26 3:27 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:32 3:37 MALE: I mean, last weekend though I went to Japantown with my, a friend of mine.

3:31 3:32 FEMALE: Oh really?

3:38 3:39 MALE: And they had a film festival there that, like, him and his friends went to.

3:33 3:34 FEMALE: Oh cool.  

3:40 3:42 MALE: I didn't have time to go to the film, but--

3:35 3:36 FEMALE: That's very cool.

3:42 3:49 MALE: It's a really nice are, and I spent some time in Japan last year, so go back to, like, some of the authentic restaurants and--

3:50 3:51 MALE: See the crafts and stuff.

3:45 3:46 FEMALE: So how long have you been in California, then?

3:52 3:54 MALE: Actually just since September.

3:48 3:49 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:54 3:57 MALE: I'm a first year student myself.  I don't know if that implies you're a first year student.

3:50 3:53 FEMALE: Yes, I am a first year student myself, so.

3:59 4:00 MALE: That's cool.

4:01 4:03 FEMALE: Okay.  nameX's my roommate actually, so--

4:09 4:10 MALE: Oh okay.

4:03 4:05 FEMALE: That may be why you look a little bit familiar to me then.

4:11 4:13 FEMALE: Are you a uh PhD student or?

4:18 4:19 MALE: Actually just a master's.

4:13 4:14 FEMALE: So you're almost done then.

4:20 4:21 MALE: Yeah.  

4:15 4:16 FEMALE: Do you know what you're going to do next year?

4:22 4:26 MALE: Not a whole lot.  I'm trying to, you know, apply for different jobs.  I was just at one today and--

4:20 4:23  FEMALE: It's got to be hard to do a master's in a year--

4:29 4:30 MALE: Yeah.  

4:23 4:24 FEMALE: And apply for jobs and--

4:30 4:33 MALE: Yeah.  It's, it's crazy.  So I'm probably just going to, like, chill for a little for a quarter, so.
