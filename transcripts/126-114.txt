00:37  	00:38  	MALE:  Warmer.

00:39  	00:42  	FEMALE:  So, yeah I grew up in a very small town.  So I feel like this is a city.

00:43  	00:44	MALE:  Oh, all right.

00:44  	00:46  	FEMALE:  Everyone I've met from the city says this is not a city.

00:46 	00:47  	MALE:  Right, right, right.  Yeah. Actually I stayed with a close family when I grew up to New York City a place called Spring Valley.

00:56  	00:58  	FEMALE:  Sounds familiar but I have no idea where that is.

00:59  	01:04  	MALE:  Right, right, right.  I think it took them about 15 minutes by car to get to the [unintelligible].

01:05  	01:07  	FEMALE:  We were a little further it took us about an hour.

01:08  	01:08  	MALE:  Right, right, right.  I see.

01:09  	01:13  	FEMALE:  I think an hour is the perfect distance from the city for me [laughter]

01:14  	01:15  	MALE:  [laughter] yeah.  And where did you do your undergraduate?

01:16  	01:16  	FEMALE:  At the University of Virginia.

01:17  	01:17  	MALE:  Okay.  

01:19  	01:23  	FEMALE:  [laughter] so what do you do when you're not doing school? 

01:24  	01:34  	MALE:  Um, I watch sports.  I'm I do karate Stanford class or I don't know meeting my friends.  I have a couple of friends from there.

01:34  	01:36  	FEMALE:  Friends that you knew from Russia?

01:37  	01:46  	MALE:   Yeah, actually one of the guys we went to school together.  And he went to [unintelligible] and he's been here for like ten years or eleven years now.  

01:47  	01:47  	FEMALE:  Ah-huh.  [unintelligible].

01:48  	01:53  	MALE:  And now I came to Stanford and [unintelligible].
 
01:54  	02:00  	FEMALE:  And it seems like in my not very good experience that there's a pretty good network with Russian people. 

02:00  	02:01  	MALE:  [laughter]

02:02  	02:10  	FEMALE:  I know that sounds terrible, but one of the girls I study with is Russian she's from Saint Petersburg.  

02:10  	02:10  	MALE:  Okay.

02:10  	02:18  	FEMALE:  And I mean, she tells me about millions of people from Russia so, I don't know there's like Russians and I don't realize it.  It seems like they are fairly well connected.

02:18  	02:25  	MALE:  Um, actually I too many Russians on campus.  I know that there are [unintelligible] on campus. 

02:25  	02:33  	FEMALE:  Yeah, she does -- she goes to a lot of cultural events out you know in San Francisco and San Jose.

02:34  	02:34  	MALE:  Okay.

02:35  	02:36  	FEMALE:  So somehow she's knows about that.

02:37  	02:49  	MALE:  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  Actually I'd like to more Russians here, because sometimes I bump into people, but it's not like I met them at the [unintelligible] or some kind of Russian event so.  [unintelligible].

02:49  	02:50  	FEMALE:  [laughter].  Yeah.

02:52  	02:55  	MALE:  So how do you like California compared to Virginia?

02:56  	03:01  	FEMALE:  I loved Virginia, so, [unintelligible] and that but I loved Virginia. 

03:02  	03:03  	MALE:  [laughter] right, right.

03:04  	03:08  	FEMALE:  I'm going to have to stop idealizing Virginia at some point, but I really, really liked it.

03:09  	03:09  	MALE:  Okay.  Fair enough.

03:10  	03:14  	FEMALE:  So yeah. So do you intentions of going back to Russia or?

03:15  	03:25  	MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Someday I would like to go back, probably [unintelligible] with my PhD, but yeah in the long run.  Yeah.  

03:25  	03:25  	FEMALE: Yeah.

03:27  	03:29  	MALE:  Do you have any intentions of going back to Virginia?

03:29  	03:30  	FEMALE:  Sort of in my dreams.

03:31  	03:33  	MALE:  [laughter].

03:34  	03:41  	FEMALE:  I really want to teach but I would never teach in a school like Stanford [laughter].  It's too high stress and I really care about the teaching not the research.

03:42  	03:42  	MALE:  Okay.

03:43  	03:44  	FEMALE:  So -- I'm in Electrical Engineering.

03:45  	03:45  	MALE:  All right.

03:45  	04:04  	FEMALE:  Like everyone else in this school.  I mean -- the electrical department is huge.  And the big focus is on research and I want to focus on teaching.  At my undergrad school research was on mostly teaching I want to go to a place [horn] like spend time with students.  So -- if they would hire me I would love to though.

04:04  	04:05  	MALE:  [laughter].

04:06  	04:07  	FEMALE:  Well, nice meeting you.

04:08  	04:09  	MALE:  Very nice meeting you.
