0:00:07.2  0:00:08.4  MALE:  male311.
0:00:25.9  0:00:27.4  FEMALE:  I'm school of education student. 
0:00:10.0  0:00:10.7  MALE:  Oh you are? 
0:00:28.5  0:00:28.6  FEMALE:  Um-hmm. 
0:00:11.1  0:00:12.7  MALE:  So you work with [unintelligible]? 
0:00:29.9  0:00:31.9  FEMALE:  Yes, we are cohort mates. 
0:00:14.6  0:00:15.3  MALE:  Oh really. 
0:00:33.0  0:00:33.4  FEMALE:  Um-hmm. 
0:00:15.9  0:00:24.7  MALE:  So your doing--you can actually start the study and realize, you know, I am an astro-physisis with all these like [unintelligible]. 
0:00:42.5  0:00:45.1  FEMALE:  Yeah.  I invented balloons. 
0:00:26.9  0:00:40.7   MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  [unintelligible] it'd be interesting to monitor how peoples stories change in time.  They started out like modest beginnings.  And then, you know, by the 20th date they're like I invented, you know, hellium.  You know. 
0:00:58.0  0:00:59.1  FEMALE:  [laughter] [unintelligible]. 
0:00:41.5  0:00:46.7  MALE:  That's why I'm so gasy.  Yeah, exactly.  So what kind of things are you studing in education? 
0:01:04.3  0:01:06.9  FEMALE:  Higher education/minority women. 
0:00:49.1  0:00:50.3  MALE:  Oh really.  Wow. 
0:01:08.5  0:01:12.8  FEMALE:  Um, shock, shock.  Personal connection there. 
0:00:55.3  0:00:55.9  MALE:  Hmm. 
0:01:13.5  0:01:17.1  FEMALE:  But um, I'm specifically looking at like admissions gamee. 
0:00:59.8  0:01:03.3  MALE:  Oh, how admissions is done.  That's actually pretty fascinating. 
0:01:20.9  0:01:23.1  FEMALE:  It's, it's crazy. 
0:01:05.6  0:01:12.9  MALE:  Well [unintelligible] they had this thing in Michigan a couple years ago.  Do you know--you probably heard about [unintelligible].  They had this whole like point system of ranking people.
0:01:31.5  0:01:33.2  FEMALE:  Okay.  [unintelligible] vaguely mentioned that to me. 
0:01:15.5  0:01:23.6  MALE:  Yeah.  Which is just, to me is like fascinating because it seems that no matter what you do somebody's going to be upset.  You're not going to make anyone happy. 
0:01:41.3  0:01:41.8  FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:01:25.0  0:01:27.1  MALE:  So I imagine it's sort of a challanging thing to study. 
0:01:45.1  0:01:49.1  FEMALE:  I'm feeling very blessed that things are coming together.  I have a week until it's due. 
0:01:32.3  0:01:32.9  MALE:  Oh really. 
0:01:50.5  0:01:54.2  FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] project is due next week. 
0:01:36.3  0:01:37.0  MALE:  Oh wow. 
0:01:55.2  0:02:00.0  FEMALE:  Um, so this is the crunch time.  This is also--God, I sound like um, Mr. Miyagi or something. 
0:01:42.1  0:01:42.3  MALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:01.4  0:02:13.9  FEMALE:  But this is like the time where I'm truely going to earn my degree.  And um, like the, the, the whole whatever, the whole point of my study is going to like come into focus this week. 
0:01:56.4  0:01:57.6  MALE:  Wow. 
0:02:15.0  0:02:17.0  FEMALE:  So it's a pretty intense week. 
0:01:58.9  0:01:59.6  MALE:  Pretty intense time. 
0:02:17.2  0:02:17.6  FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:01:59.6  0:02:01.8  MALE:  [unintelligible] should be like taking you out to dinner. 
0:02:19.6  0:02:20.4  FEMALE:  [laughter]. 
0:02:02.3  0:02:04.0  MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:02:22.6  0:02:25.3  FEMALE:  She'll teach me how to do some sexy Indian dance. 
0:02:07.4  0:02:12.1  MALE:  Yeah.  There you go. Hey, that's cool. That could be useful. 
0:02:30.1  0:02:30.3  FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:02:12.7  0:02:13.5  MALE:  In the education market.
0:02:31.3  0:02:31.7  FEMALE:  Right. 
0:02:14.3  0:02:20.0  MALE:  So what do you do after this?  You, you, you work at a, like an admissions or what's sort of the plan for you? 
0:02:37.5  0:02:41.0  FEMALE:  Right.  Honestly admissions would probably drain the life out of me. 
0:02:23.7  0:02:23.9  MALE:  Okay. 
0:02:41.8  0:03:04.7  FEMALE:  It just would be like too much stree and all this filing and screaming parents and all this stuff.  So um, I'm interested in a form of, like, you know, armchair anthropologists, you know, perspective.  But I would like to be on a campus in administration in active student organizations and other stuff.  So I thought the best thing for me would be student affairs. 
0:02:46.8  0:02:47.4  MALE:  Um.
0:03:05.4  0:03:13.3  FEMALE:  So I'm trying to find a student affairs job right now.  I'm trying to.  I want to focus on like student organization, you know, mentorship or something. 
0:02:55.4  0:03:07.6  MALE:  That's actually really cool because I think that's what, you know when I went to undergrad and even, you know, in grad school.  And mentorship is something that people talk about [unintelligible], like we really need a  mentor.  But not just because that person [unintelligible]. 
0:03:25.5  0:03:28.1  FEMALE:  [laughter].
0:03:08.7  0:03:47.3  MALE:  No, but it's important and, and I think there's a lot of people willing to do it.  But is sorf of never materializes a lot of times.  Because you know there's not necessarily a form or something like that, you know.  I went to--I'm on my second master's.  I did [unintelligible] and they had a mentorship program there.  They have alumi would come in and mentor people.  That was awesome.  Really amazing.  And you know, that really doesn't happen beyond the advisor in my current school, in engineering.  And it's sort of like I sort of miss sort of interaction because I really want to know how people have used what they've learned.  And whether they say [unintelligible].
0:04:04.0  0:04:05.0  FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:03:46.9  0:03:50.6  MALE:  You know or you take what you learned here and pay attention. 
0:04:09.9  0:04:20.6  FEMALE:  So how are you doing with school?  Is it stressful, ridiculously stressful?  Do you get a chance to build community?  I honestly am stressed.  And I've built a little community [unintelligible]. 
0:04:03.2  0:04:07.5  MALE:  [unintelligible].  Yeah.  You know, it's okay.  It's not--I try not to make it stressful. 
0:04:25.6  0:04:26.8  FEMALE:  A couple more weeks and then we're free. 
0:04:09.3  0:04:10.1  MALE:  There you go. 
0:04:27.7  0:04:28.9  FEMALE:  Hey, need a job. 
0:04:10.7  0:04:11.2  MALE:  Yeah, exactly. 
0:04:29.6  0:04:30.4  FEMALE:  Need to pay back the loans. 
0:04:12.9  0:04:15.3  MALE:  It's true.  I still have plenty of loans. 
0:04:34.0  0:04:34.4  FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:04:16.9  0:04:19.5  MALE:  Nice meeting you.
