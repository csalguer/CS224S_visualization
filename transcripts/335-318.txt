0:01 0:02 FEMALE: Hi.
0:03 0:04 MALE: Hi, I'm nameX.
0:03 0:12 FEMALE: nameX [phonetic]?  It's nice to meet you.  I'm female335. I'm just going to write your name down so I remember how to spell it.  How are you?
0:14 0:15 MALE: Pretty good.  How, how about you?
0:14 0:21 FEMALE: I'm good.  Um, what was the last movie you saw in the theater?  I'm trying to get suggestions for what to do this weekend.
0:22 0:28 MALE: Uh, it's been a long time since I watched a movie in the theater.
0:25 0:25 FEMALE: Really?
0:28 0:31 MALE: I--House, House of Flying Daggers.
0:31 0:33 FEMALE: Was--oh, I want to see it.  Was it good?
0:35 0:42 MALE: If you do not care about the story line, then yeah.  If you would just enjoy the scenes, it's fine.
0:41 0:41 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:42 0:43 MALE: But the, the story itself is, is simple. 
0:43 0:50 FEMALE: It seems like that sort of genre is becoming very popular with--like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and all that. 
0:51 0:53 MALE: Uh, there is another movie in between.  It's called Hero.
0:52 0:53  FEMALE: Right, right.
0:54 0:56 MALE: So I think Hero is actually better. 
0:55 0:55 FEMALE: Okay.
0:56 0:58 MALE: But different people have different tastes.
0:58 1:10 FEMALE: No, I haven't seen that either.  It's intere--I think it's like, a whole new genre of special effects, kind of.  Like, the Matrix started one thing, and now there are a lot more flying daggers type scenes in movies.  But, uh--
1:11 1:14 MALE: Did you like just any movie, or do you like, um--
1:14 1:35 FEMALE: Yeah, I, I, I like watching movies.  Um, I mostly like movies that aren't too, uh, intense.  I like complicated movies, but a lot of times, if I want to see a film, I definitely am usually in a different mood than if I just want to relax and watch something kind of light.  Um, so I just--I watch a lot of comedies just because of that, you know--
1:36 1:38 MALE: It's very relaxing and, uh--
1:37 1:38 FEMALE: Yeah.  Exactly.
1:38 1:39 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
1:38 1:45 FEMALE: Yeah, and when--you know, after a long day of work or something, you just kind of--and maybe you can tell what's going to happen, but you still kind of laugh and--
1:47 1:49 MALE: Oh, like, uh, Road--Old School and Road Trip?  
1:47 1:48 FEMALE: Right.
1:50 1:51 MALE: That kind of thing?
1:50 1:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  I like those.  Or, you know, Legally Blonde.  Have you seen [unintelligible].
1:55 1:56 MALE: Yeah, I watched that, too.
1:55 1:57 FEMALE: I'm a big fan.  I own it, actually. 
1:58 1:59 MALE: One or two?
1:58 2:05 FEMALE: I didn't like two that much, unfortunately.  Sequels are always a bad idea, almost.  You know, not quite always, but almost always.
2:06 2:08 MALE: Yeah, but just for a purpose of a laugh, then.
2:07 2:22 FEMALE: Right.  Yeah, that was a good one.  But the problem there, I think, was that it was too similar to the first one.  Like, they had a script that worked one time, and then they basically did the same exact thing but slightly changed the context.  Anyway, probably more than you wanted to know, but [unintelligible].  Are you going to see Star Wars?
2:24 2:29 MALE: Uh, eventually, yeah, but probably not in the--in the first few weeks.
2:28 2:29 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:30 2:35 MALE: Maybe I will pick up the rest of the movies so that I can remember all the stories.
2:36 2:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:37 2:42 MALE: I watched the--I think I watched the Star Wars, like, uh, five or six years ago.
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: Um hm. 
2:43 2:48 MALE: When I was in China.  So--actually, I don't remember all the stories, so-- 
2:49 2:54 FEMALE: It's been a long time since I've seen the last three also.  It'd be good to catch up.
2:56 2:57 MALE: Have you seen Lord of the Rings?
2:58 3:04 FEMALE: No, and the reason why is because I really love the books a lot, and--
3:05 3:07 MALE: So you don't want the movie to spoil the books.
3:06 3:15 FEMALE: Exactly, especially, like, fantasy--those types of books, I kind of feel like a movie is almost contradictory to what the point of the style of literature is. 
3:16 3:21 MALE: Yeah, because you have so much freedom to let your imagination go when you read the book.
3:19 3:41 FEMALE: Right.  And I think that Tolkien, especially, was so good at describing that world very completely that I almost don't want to see a director's interpretation.  But I've heard that they're very good, and I've heard that they're true to the books.  I just prefer to not watch.  Yeah, I feel really strongly about movies that are made based on books, and I don't like it when--it's not that I just don't like to watch it because of that. 
3:43 3:53 MALE: Yeah, if I had time, I would watch it--a lot of movies because my, my list [unintelligible] to watch is getting longer and longer.
3:53 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah.  I know, there's not that much time, though. 
3:58 3:59 MALE: Um, what do you study?
3:59 4:02 FEMALE: Um, I'm getting my PhD in biology.  What about you?
4:03 4:04 MALE: Uh, PhD in Physics.
4:04 4:06 FEMALE: Oh, that's great.  My brother-in-law's a physicist. 
4:07 4:08 MALE: Nice to meet you.
4:07 4:08 FEMALE: It's nice to meet you, too.
