0:30 0:31 FEMALE: male315, nice to meet you.
0:13 0:16 MALE: Why don't you um, tell me a litle bit about you and I'll tell you about me.
0:34 0:37 FEMALE: [laughter] Sounds like an interview.  Okay, um--
0:20 0:21 MALE: [laughter] I'm with the business school, that's all I know.  
0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Okay [laughter]
0:22 0:22 MALE: [laughter]
0:43 0:55 FEMALE: So why do you want to-- you know.  Why are you applying to business school?  And what do you want to do with this degree?  No, I am a uh, M.D./Ph.D. student, medicine and neuroscience.  Um, finishing my second year of M.D. now, uh starting my Ph.D. in the summer.  
0:37 0:38 MALE: Wow.
0:56 0:57 FEMALE: I'll be here for a while.  And then my--
0:39 0:40 MALE: That's like a ten year program or-- ?
0:59 1:05 FEMALE: Eight year.  Yeah.  It's a while.  Uh, and then I did my undergrad here, so it will be a total of 12 years at Stanford.
0:48 0:49 MALE: Oh, I did my undergrad here, too.
1:07 1:08 FEMALE: Oh, really, that's cool.  That's awesome.
0:50 0:51 MALE: What year were you?
1:09 1:10 FEMALE: 2003.
0:52 0:53 MALE: Okay, I was '99.
1:11 1:14 FEMALE: Okay.  Awesome.  So we completely did not overlap.
0:56 0:57 MALE: No, we didn't overlap.
1:15 1:18 FEMALE: Or, well actually you graduated in '9-- Oh, yeah, you graduated '99, I started '99.
1:00 1:01 MALE: You started '99.
1:19 1:25 FEMALE: Yeah, okay, well done.  Uh, and-- Yeah.  I'm from Croatia originally, and--
1:07 1:09 MALE: Oh, you're from Cro- from- from Zagreb, or-- ?
1:27 1:32 FEMALE: Uh, a small town close to Zagreb, so it's about 50 kilometers away, Sisak.
1:14 1:15 MALE: On the coast, or-- 
1:33 1:36 FEMALE: No, it's in the-- in close to Zagreb, but yeah.
1:18 1:18 MALE: Okay.  
1:36 1:40 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, and that's pretty much essentially it.  How about yourself?  
1:22 1:24 MALE: Well, I um, I grew up in San Diego.
1:42 1:43 FEMALE: Okay.
1:25 1:29 MALE: I went here undergrad, and then I went to New York and was working in New York for two years, and then I was transferred to Paris.
1:48 1:48 FEMALE: Nice.
1:30 1:31 MALE: And, yeah it was--
1:49 1:49 FEMALE: That's fortunate.
1:32 1:34 MALE: I was supposed to be there for one year, but I stayed for four.
1:52 1:52 FEMALE: Nice.
1:35 1:38 MALE: And then I just was moving back, and I'm in the first year at the business school.
1:56 1:56 FEMALE: Awesome.  
1:39 1:39 MALE: Yeah, so--
1:57 1:58 FEMALE: Very cool.  How did you like living in Paris?  
1:40 1:42 MALE: I had a great time, I had a wonderful time.
2:00 2:01 FEMALE: I guess, I guess since you stayed four years.
1:43 1:44 MALE: Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.
2:02 2:03 FEMALE: That's very cool.  
1:45 1:51 MALE: And uh, how do you choose first systems and- and medical school at the same time?
2:09 2:10 FEMALE: Neuroscience and-- 
1:52 1:53 MALE: Did you say neuroscience?  
2:11 2:11 FEMALE: Neuroscience.
1:53 1:54 MALE: Oh, I heard earth systems.
2:12 2:12 FEMALE: No.
1:55 1:57 MALE: I was like, that's kind of unusual.  
2:15 2:21 FEMALE: That would be a weird combination.  I mean, it would be intriguing, but no, I'm not that person.  No. [laughter]  Uh, neuroscience, and--
2:03 2:04 MALE: That goes together much better.
2:22 2:24 FEMALE: I- I think so, too, yes.  [laughter]
2:06 2:06 MALE: Awesome.
2:25 2:45 FEMALE: Yeah, so, how did I choose neuroscience, I-- I just find really interesting.  It's one of those things that really the field found me more than I found it.  Like I kind of just like was taking classes, and then you know, I just got more interested, and then I did some undergrad research and it happened to be neuroscience, and I just loved it, and after a while I was just, I was thinking about other things, and I was like, "I just don't really care about this," and I'm really interested in neuroscience, so-- 
2:28 2:28 MALE: Awesome.
2:46 2:53 FEMALE: It's really, like I don't have like a very spectacular moment of revelation story, it just really kind of happened, but I like it a lot.
2:35 2:39 MALE: So- so you came to Stanford in '99, and you're going to leave in like 200--
2:57 2:57 FEMALE: 2011.
2:40 2:40 MALE: In 2011.
3:00 3:03 FEMALE: Under optimistic circumstances.  My Ph.D. [unintelligible] could take five years, in which case it would be--
2:45 2:45 MALE: 2012.
3:04 3:04 FEMALE: 2012.
2:47 2:50 MALE: And would you like to, and then would you go, and you want to do research afterwards.  
3:09 3:18 FEMALE: Probably, mostly research, maybe some medicine, but-- although honestly, to be perfectly honest, things change, people change, I may change, what I want to do six years from now--
3:00 3:01 MALE: Could be different, yeah.  
3:19 3:27 FEMALE: Could be different, so I may change my mind, but right now, the idea is, yes, mostly research.  But theoretically, somehow fitting into this whole medical universe.
3:09 3:09 MALE: Yeah.
3:27 3:29 FEMALE: Hence the M.D. degree.  But we'll see.
3:12 3:15 MALE: Exactly.  And uh, how did you- how did you decide to come to Stanford from Croatia?
3:32 3:54 FEMALE: From Croatia?  It's kind of a random thing, uh, I applied to a bunch of different schools simply because I didn't really know like how, you know, well I, you know, compared to other candidates and whatnot.  And I chose Stanford because, among other places, where I was applying, just because my sister was already in San Francisco, and this was the only school that actually was good, and so like I really liked it, so I was like, "Oh, it's gorgeous."  
3:36 3:36 MALE: It is.
3:55 4:01 FEMALE: Then like applied and then like I ended up choosing between Stanford and Princeton, and I just decided to come to Stanford.  So.  [horn]  Yeah.
3:43 3:44 MALE: Awesome.  Well, I enjoyed meeting you.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE: Nice meeting you, too.
3:45 3:45 MALE: Yeah, take care.
