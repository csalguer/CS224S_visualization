0:02:34.4 0:02:37.9 MALE:  Twenty-three- or twenty-two, you could have been twenty-two to twenty-eight so.

0:02:39.9 0:02:40.5 MALE:  No?

0:02:46.1 0:02:50.9 MALE:  [laughter] Yeah, that's true.  But I'll probably guess, I don't know.
0:02:50.7 0:02:51.3 FEMALE:  Twenty-eight.
0:02:51.4 0:02:53.0 MALE:  What- what program did you say you're in? 
0:02:53.0 0:02:53.8 FEMALE:  Education.
0:02:53.7 0:02:54.5 MALE:  Okay.
0:02:54.9 0:02:56.9 FEMALE:  Sociology [unintelligible] 
0:02:56.2 0:03:01.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  So do you know all these people?  Are you one of the people planted here?
0:03:01.6 0:03:07.4 FEMALE:  Oh, oh, one of- no I'm not, but I'm one of the people [unintelligible] will you please sign up.
0:03:07.4 0:03:08.0 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:07.3 0:03:08.9 FEMALE:  Yeah, okay.  
0:03:09.0 0:03:09.5 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:09.2 0:03:13.8 FEMALE:  And you know- and you know how hard it is to get subjects to participate in studies.  It's really hard. 
0:03:13.7 0:03:14.2 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:14.0 0:03:15.7 FEMALE:  So I felt really sorry [unintelligible] 
0:03:15.5 0:03:16.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
0:03:15.4 0:03:18.0 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] cute guy.
0:03:18.0 0:03:20.8 MALE:  Yeah, exactly.  [laughter]
0:03:20.5 0:03:22.4 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] cute men.
0:03:22.2 0:03:27.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.  So you were saying [unintelligible] and you're not on the rebound is what you're saying?
0:03:27.1 0:03:28.6 FEMALE:  No, I am not on the rebound. 
0:03:28.5 0:03:29.1 MALE:  Okay.  
0:03:30.1 0:03:30.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:30.6 0:03:31.4 MALE:  All right.  So that's good.
0:03:31.0 0:03:35.1 FEMALE:  Tell me about this girlfriend that [unintelligible] or, you know, [unintelligible] or you dumped.  Who dumped who?
0:03:35.0 0:03:45.4 MALE:  It was actually kind of complicated.  I kind of told her that I think we should break up and then she talked me out of it.  And then a few weeks later she dumped me.  [laughter] And-
0:03:45.0 0:03:47.0 FEMALE:  [laughter] [unintelligible] that's a false trick. 
0:03:47.0 0:03:57.1 MALE:  Is it?  Yeah, I- yeah, I guess.  Again, I kind of saw what happened over those few weeks.  Kind of a really gradual breakup.  I guess maybe I made it kind of easier.  I don't know but [unintelligible] really such a good idea.
0:03:57.7 0:03:59.8 FEMALE:  Most people [unintelligible] want to be the dumpee. 
0:03:59.4 0:04:03.3 MALE:  Yeah.  She even told me that she'd never been dumped.  And now--
0:04:02.9 0:04:04.5 FEMALE:  She would need to be the dumper.
0:04:04.0 0:04:06.5 MALE:  Now I understand exactly what that means.
0:04:06.7 0:04:08.7 FEMALE:  Don't fall for that trick again.  [laughter]  
0:04:08.1 0:04:09.6 MALE:  Oh yeah. [laughter] Thanks.
0:04:08.6 0:04:09.2 [horn]
0:04:10.4 0:04:11.2 FEMALE:  It was nice to meet you. 
0:04:10.5 0:04:13.2 MALE:  Oh, yeah, nice to meet you.  I had a fun-- 
0:04:13.2 0:04:14.1 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:04:14.0 0:04:14.6 MALE:  --speed date.
0:04:15.0 0:04:17.0 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]
