0:00 0:01 FEMALE: What number are you on?
0:04 0:05 MALE: Um, what number am I on?
0:03 0:03 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:05 0:10 MALE: Um, 14, but we had to sit out a couple.  The guys had to sit out a couple.  You should be around 16 by now. 
0:07 0:10 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Because, like, I had a couple of blank pages here. 
0:12 0:14 MALE: Yeah, you just skip them, right?
0:12 0:15 FEMALE: Yeah. What was the purpose of that?
0:17 0:18 MALE: To confuse us. [laughter]
0:16 0:18 FEMALE: Oh, I think there might be more guys than girls?
0:21 0:25 MALE: I don't know.  Maybe there's something like that going on.  Yeah, there's definitely more girls than guys 'cause--
0:22 0:23 FEMALE: More girls than guys?
0:26 0:27 MALE: Uh, no.  My guys than girls.  Right.  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE: More guys than girls. Yeah. 
0:27 0:29 MALE: Right because--'cause guys are sitting it out. 
0:27 0:32 FEMALE: Okay.  That makes--that's why the two pages.  Ah.  That would make sense, then.  Anyway, I'm female334. 
0:35 0:36 MALE: I'm male317 [phonetic].  How are you?
0:33 0:37 FEMALE: male317, nice to meet you.  So what, what are you studying here?
0:39 0:40 MALE: Uh, electrical engineering. 
0:38 0:39 FEMALE: EE?
0:41 0:42 MALE: Yeah. 
0:39 0:42 FEMALE: Let's see.  I think I've hit three people who are studying EE.
0:44 0:45 MALE: Three?  So one of them is male317.
0:44 0:45 FEMALE: Yes, I met male317 from Spain.
0:48 0:50 MALE: And there's one other, hey?
0:46 0:48 FEMALE: And, uh--
0:52 0:53 MALE: Quiz.  Pop quiz.  [laughter]
0:51 0:52 FEMALE: [laughter]  Whoa, it's not fair. 
0:53 0:55 MALE: You can't differentiate between us guys, can you?
0:54 0:55 FEMALE: I remember faces. 
0:55 0:58 MALE: We're all the same.  Oh, a bunch of [unintelligible] [laughter].
0:56 0:57 FEMALE: [laughter] That's not fair. 
0:59 1:00 MALE: What are you?
0:58 1:00 FEMALE: I'm studying Immunology. 
1:02 1:03 MALE: Immunology.  Okay.  Cool.
1:01 1:05 FEMALE: Yeah.  So I'm over in the medical school, PhD program. 
1:05 1:08 MALE: Medical school.  Okay.  I hope you don't take your work home with you.  [laughter]
1:07 1:16 FEMALE: [laughter] No, I, I managed to--no [unintelligible].  Yeah, no, I don't.  It's hard 'cause you have to go to the lab.  I mean, unless you're taking the flu virus home with you or something. 
1:18 1:19 MALE: [laughter] That's right. 
1:16 1:23 FEMALE: No, I don't actually work with any viruses or bacteria.  I just work on how the, uh, the immune system develops. 
1:25 1:27 MALE: And people make bad jokes about your career all the time. 
1:25 1:29 FEMALE: Not too often.  Actually, more, they're interested in what disease do you work on. 
1:31 1:32 MALE: Oh, okay.  What disease do you work on?
1:30 1:31 FEMALE: I actually don't.  
1:33 1:34 MALE: Ah, okay. 
1:31 1:40 FEMALE: So I have a lot of implications for diseases, but, like, if you work on how the immune system develops, how it differentiates between foreign tissue and yourself.
1:42 1:46 MALE: That's right. [unintelligible] 
1:42 1:43 FEMALE: So, like, decides between--
1:46 1:47 MALE: Like, allergies?
1:44 1:50 FEMALE: Uh, allergies, yeah.  And, um, like, diabetes or multiple sclerosis.  Different auto-immune diseases.
1:52 1:53 MALE: That's right.  Huh. 
1:51 1:53 FEMALE: So, so it doesn't kill you, basically. 
1:55 1:56 MALE: Interesting. 
1:54 1:55 FEMALE: It's actually an interesting process. 
1:57 1:59 MALE: Yeah, that's right.  [unintelligible]. 
1:57 1:58 FEMALE: So what do you do in EE?
2:01 2:10 MALE: [unintelligible] it's, like, single-chip multiprocessors, you know, having several processes on the same chip [unintelligible] application together. 
2:06 2:07 FEMALE: Um hm. 
2:11 2:18 MALE: And, uh, it's--[unintelligible] talk about how you can write applications for this [unintelligible] performance you can expect. 
2:17 2:19 FEMALE: So a lot of time spent doing computer work, or--
2:22 2:28 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  So I can work from just about anywhere.  I tend to work from home most of the time.  Sort of the opposite of you.  I don't have to go into the lab.  [laughter]
2:25 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah.  But, I mean, there are advantages to having to go into the lab.  If you decide to leave it there, I mean, you can't take it home with you, right?
2:33 2:35 MALE: That's right.  Exactly. Exactly.  
2:33 2:34 FEMALE: But, um--
2:36 2:39 MALE: Yeah, the, the nice thing about working in a lab is then you get to meet people. 
2:37 2:37 FEMALE: That's true. 
2:40 2:42 MALE: You know, the easiest place to do the work is at home.
2:38 2:39 FEMALE: It's a lot more social.
2:42 2:45 MALE: But it turns out that you [unintelligible] meet that many people.
2:43 2:45 FEMALE: You don't have an office or anything?
2:46 2:51 MALE: I do, but to go in there, everybody's talking, you can't get any work done, you know?  People go there sort of to socialize, right?
2:48 2:49 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:51 2:58 MALE: You go there for the group meeting, talk to people, get a few pointers on things.  Then you go back, and almost everybody programs at home, you know? So--
2:56 2:59 FEMALE: Well, I mean, someplace more comfortable.  I can understand that. 
3:01 3:06 MALE: Yeah, that's right.  Yep, you can toss back and just take off your shoes and eat what you want [laughter].
3:03 3:09 FEMALE: [laughter] You can--you can get up and start working.  You don't have to get ready and make sure people--you're presentable for everyone. 
3:09 3:13 MALE: That's right.  That's right.  That's right. 
3:11 3:12 FEMALE: So where are you--oh, go ahead.
3:15 3:16 MALE: So what do you--what do you like to do in your spare time?
3:15 3:21 FEMALE: See, I like to read, and I like to hike, although lately that's been a bit dampened.  I hurt my knee playing soccer. 
3:23 3:24 MALE: Ow, okay. 
3:22 3:36 FEMALE: I blew a bunch of cartilage out. Um, uh, play lots of games.  Not too much of a partier, but, uh, yeah.  I'm, I'm pretty much up for anything. 
3:38 3:39 MALE: Yeah, I'm not that much of a partier myself. 
3:37 3:41 FEMALE: It doesn't--doesn't require too much drinking.  Uh, oh.  I think I might get in trouble here. 
3:41 3:46 MALE: Yeah, that's right.  So is this your first time doing speed dating?
3:44 3:46 FEMALE: It is, actually.  It's a bit--it's--
3:48 3:51 MALE: Yeah, I don't know if anybody's ever done it before.
3:48 3:51 FEMALE: You get to meet a lot of people all at the same time.  It, it's kind of cool.
3:52 3:56 MALE: It's it cool?  That's right.  There's probably more people than I meet in a month, you know?
3:55 3:57 FEMALE: [laughter] Well, I mean, I suppose if you're, um, [unintelligible]. 
3:59 4:01 MALE: Well, I don't mean meet at all, but I mean meet and greet people, right?
3:59 4:02 FEMALE: Oh, that's true.  I mean, you do kind of run into the same people over and over. 
4:04 4:05 MALE: Yeah, that's right.  
4:03 4:04 FEMALE: Yeah.  
4:06 4:07 MALE: So it was nice meeting you.
4:05 4:07 FEMALE: It was nice to meet you to.  Have a good one. 
4:09 4:09 MALE: Thank you.
4:11 4:12 FEMALE: I ripped out my paper.
