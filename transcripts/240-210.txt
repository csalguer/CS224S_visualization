0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  I'm female240, nice to meet you.
0:01 0:02 MALE:  I'm male210.
0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  What kind of name is that?
0:04 0:05 MALE:  It's a French name.
0:05 0:12 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, cool.  Where you from?  Where in France? [laughter] Where are you from in France?
0:12 0:13 MALE:  Ah, Leone.
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  Where?  Oh, Leone?
0:13 0:14 MALE:  Leone.
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  Oh, that's cool.
0:15 0:16 MALE:  Yeah, but I'm studying in Paris.
0:16 0:20 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, cool.  I lived in Paris for a summer actually [laughter].
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Really?
0:21 0:32 FEMALE:  But my French didn't improve at all, actually [laughter].  It's so bad, like, whenever I would try to speak French like the French person would just get like exasperated and just speak back to me [unintelligible] and I was like, alright.
0:32 0:44 MALE:  I understand what you are talking about.  It is difficult for me to, yes.  But unfortunately people don't speak French in America so I have to, to make them understand in English.  I don't have a choice.
0:44 0:47 FEMALE:  I know, well, English is always a good language to know, that's what I tell myself [laughter].
0:47 0:49 MALE:  Yes, I think it's indispensable.
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  Your English is really good.
0:51 1:12 MALE:  I don't think so.  I'm really showing progress.  But um, I'm such a lucky guy where, I live with a French, uh friend.  So I almost always speak French with them when I shouldn't.  I'm not a, I haven't been here for a long time so I haven't met a lot of American people, as I hope I will and um...
1:12 1:17 FEMALE:  Yeah, of course, you will [laughter].  There aren't that many French people that you can just, kind of, yeah?
1:16 1:20 MALE:  There's, there's people around, only from my school, we are 25.
1:21 1:22 FEMALE:  Oh, what school are you in?
1:22 1:31 MALE:  So I, I knew them.  I'm from um, [unintelligible] in Paris.  It's a [unintelligible].  French schools are not really famous here.
1:31 1:33 FEMALE:  Oh, no, no, no I meant like what department are you in here?
1:33 1:36 MALE:  Ah, I'm sorry, I didn't understand, I am in chemical engineering department.
1:34 1:37 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.
1:38 1:39 MALE:  And you?
1:39 1:42 FEMALE:  Law school.  I'm going to be a lawyer.
1:40 1:47 MALE:  Oh, [unintelligible].  There are a lot of girls from law school here.  I think there is a couple 
1:45 1:48 FEMALE:  There are, there are two other girls from law school here tonight. 
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Yes, correct.
1:48 1:52 FEMALE:  We're all in different programs, though, that's the thing [laughter].
1:52 1:54 MALE:  Okay, so I can speak to you.
1:54 2:01 FEMALE:  [laughter] cool, cool, yeah, no I actually didn't like Paris that much when I lived there that summer.
2:01 2:02 MALE:  Oh really?
2:02 2:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, I just didn't.
2:02 2:03 MALE:  Why?
2:03 2:11 FEMALE:  Um, I think because like I lived near under these [unintelligible] way far out.  There was like the 19th and [unintelligible] or something.
2:10 2:11 MALE:  Yes.
2:11 2:29 FEMALE:  And so it was like, way, way far away and I'm like.  I think that I really wanted to learn to speak French but I just couldn't improve [laughter].  And then I kept on going to London too, so.  That's, that's a good reason.  You speak English and then you can't [laughter].  I'm not going to improve my French if I keep on visiting the UK [laughter].
2:31 2:47 MALE:  That's a pity [laughter].  She should have told you where you are, where you Americans [unintelligible] were.  You shouldn't have tried to speak English just a, you can if you want, you have to survive, so, you improve really faster if you are [unintelligible] not.  You...
2:47 2:54 FEMALE:  Yeah, no, no, no, I kind of wondered about that actually because I would try and speak French to people and they would reply to me in English.
2:54 2:55 MALE:  Oh, really?
2:54 3:25 FEMALE:  But like, the thing that I didn't understand was that like [unintelligible] people like, they don't think that I'm American.  They think that I'm like Japanese or Chinese or something like that right.  And so I finally asked one lady, I was like, why did you reply to me in English.  And she was like, oh, because when you try to speak French you have an American accent [laughter].  And I was like, what?  I was like, I just asked where the bathroom is, you know, like. [unintelligible] la toilet?  And she was just like, no the way that you said that, it was just like, that's not a French person speaking French [laughter].
3:24 3:31 MALE:  Yes we really recognize easily your, your accent, yes.  And I picture it's the same for us.
3:32 3:33 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:33 3:35 MALE:  When I speak to you, you know I'm French and I make a [unintelligible].
3:35 3:53 FEMALE:  No, the French accent sounds good right.  I think that like there's some accents that sound dorky.  Like Chinese accent trying to say English, like, like my parents they're accent [laughter].  So dorky sounding [laughter].  So, cool, chemical engineering, that's a really hard major.
3:54 3:55 MALE:  No, I don't think so.
3:55 3:56 FEMALE:  Really?
3:56 3:57 MALE:  No.
3:57 3:58 FEMALE:  Well, you must be good at it [laughter].
3:59 4:04 MALE:  I too, oh, no, no, no, no, that's so.  But I'm not here really try, oh, okay.
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  [laughter] you can finish your sentence.
4:07 4:16 MALE:  No, I, was just saying I'm not here, I'm not taking classes, I'm just here for an internship so I don't have so much work.  So I have no homework and [unintelligible].
4:16 4:19 FEMALE:  That's rad, you can just go and meet people then [laughter].
4:20 4:21 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
4:21 4:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, nice meeting you.
