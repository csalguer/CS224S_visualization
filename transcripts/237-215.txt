00:16  00:24	FEMALE:  What do I do?  Right now, I'm studying education so I'm with the rest of the folk.  And ah, originally from D.C.  And from Massachusetts, Oregon, here.  That's what I do for now.
00:25  00:27	MALE:  Wow, how do all those places compare?
00:28  00:35	FEMALE:  I like California.  I was in Oregon before this. They're both good.  So, yeah.  What about you?
00:36  00:43	MALE:  I'm from the U.K.  I'm from London.  I'm doing genetics here research.
00:44  00:46	FEMALE:  So are you just doing research at this point or --?
00:47  00:54	MALE:  Yeah.  It's going well.  I've only been here for a few weeks.  So I'm still settling in getting the lay of the lands.  
00:55  00:55	FEMALE:  Okay.
00:56  01:02	MALE:  Ah, working out with people and working and seeing what I like and its' going really well I'm enjoying.  The work's keeping me going.
01:03  01:05	FEMALE:  So how did you end up here?
01:06  01:24	MALE:  Um, I knew I wanted to come to the states at some time to do research just because it's so highly valued here.  And I just sort of sent out a bunch of interview letters and then met a handful of people and then met who I'm working with really stood out.  So, that's how I came here.  It's a combination of the techniques and the questions that she was asking. .  
01:25  01:26	FEMALE:  Ah-huh.
01:27  01:29	MALE:  We're looking at the right role of neuroscience in aging, so. 
01:30  01:33	FEMALE:  So what does that mean?  Like what is [unintelligible]?
01:34  01:35	MALE:  So --
01:36  01:37	FEMALE:  Are you like -- like at a micro level or?
01:38  01:46	MALE:  Yeah like at the molecular level so the sort of signals that the brain sends to the rest of the body and organs and how that coordinates or orchestrates how you are doing.
01:47  01:50	FEMALE:  Okay.  So you do you go about doing that?
01:51  01:54	MALE:  We're using mice and we're manipulating and see whether makes them longer or shorter.
01:55  02:02	FEMALE:  Okay.  So is this the sort of stuff that once you do it on mice you do it on like monkeys or how do you -- is it about the same?
02:03  02:24	MALE:  No, you could do human studies as well based on their cells.  There are naturally occurring people who have certain diseases which this may benefit.  So the applications would be for neurodegenerative diseases.  So, that's what we're -- Alzheimer's even [unintelligible] and things like that.  So yeah.
02:25  02:28	FEMALE:  Huh.  So were you doing research in London before you came here?
02:29  02:34	MALE:  I was, yeah.  It was using similar approaches with different subject areas.  So --
02:35  02:36	FEMALE:  Were you at a university or?
02:37  02:38	MALE:  I was at Cambridge before.
02:39  02:40	FEMALE:  I studied in Oxford for a year.
02:40  02:40	MALE:  Oh, did you?  
02:41  02:41	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:41  02:42	MALE:  Wow, excellent.

02:45  02:49	MALE:  How did you find that?  Quite similar I haven't been to Oxford well, not to the university there.  You have a good time there?
02:50  02:57	FEMALE:  Yeah.  It was a really good year.  So it was really incredible.  I met some interesting people and did some [unintelligible] work.

03:04  03:17	FEMALE:  Yeah, traveling around.  I mean there is still plenty to see you certainly know.  [unintelligible] travel around a bit and got to other places in Europe too.
