0:02 0:02 MALE:  Hi.  
0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  Hi.  
0:03 0:04 MALE:  male113.  
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  I'm female136.  Nice to meet you.  
0:05 0:07 MALE:  Good to meet you. What department are you in?  
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  I'm in the law school.  
0:08 0:11 MALE:  Oh, I'm electrical engineer.  
0:10 0:10 FEMALE:  Oh, cool.  
0:12 0:15 MALE:  Yeah.  Somebody else was in law school.  
0:13 0:17 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a bunch of my friends and I are here together.  
0:19 0:20 MALE:  Oh really?  
0:18 0:18 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:21 0:26 MALE:  That's kind of how I got roped into--my friend he got this like--he got the flier stuck on his door, right?  
0:24 0:24 FEMALE:  Oh yeah.  
0:27 0:31 MALE:  And then he like IMs me and goes, oh, we've got to try this, and then we can compare notes later. So...
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:33 0:35 MALE:  And then he didn't--he ends up not showing up.  
0:33 0:35 FEMALE:  Oh, no.  Really?  
0:37 0:37 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:36 0:45 FEMALE:  That's too bad.  Yeah, my friends and I just--like the law school, it's fun.  I made some great girlfriends, but it's kind of an insular community.  
0:48 0:48 MALE: Yeah, oh, yeah.  
0:47 0:49 FEMALE:  So, we just decided we wanted to meet people from outside of the [unintelligible].  
0:51 0:55 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah, that's definitely a good idea. I mean engineering probably even more so.  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  
0:56 1:04 MALE:  A few years into--a few years into my program like the PhD students pretty much if I don't make an effort all I know is the people in my lab.  
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
1:07 1:08 MALE:  To me at least in law school you guys have a pretty big group, right?  
1:08 1:19 FEMALE:  Basically--it's kind of--it's kind of funny because the whole school is about like a little under 600 people.  And then each class, like our class is about 180.  
1:22 1:22 MALE:  Okay.  
1:21 1:25 FEMALE: But you don't really get to know the people in the other classes. 
1:27 1:27 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:26 1:32 FEMALE:  It's really funny that way.  So, yeah it's a decent-sized community, but actually [unintelligible].  
1:34 1:37 MALE:  Oh, really?  Oh, do you think--do you live in Caruthers? 
1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  No.  
1:38 1:40 MALE:  Why are you laughing though?  
1:39 1:52 FEMALE:  No, I've lived in Escondito Village in one of the studios.  I really like, uhm, I have lived by myself for about four or five years because [unintelligible].  
1:54 1:54 MALE:  Okay.  
1:53 1:55 FEMALE: So, I wanted to live by myself.  
1:58 2:00 MALE:  So, like in undergrad you mean, or you were working for a while.  
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  I was working for a while.  
2:02 2:08 MALE:  Okay, okay.  That means you knew from experience you wanted to be a lawyer, right?  
2:06 2:07 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:09 2:16 MALE:  Because like some people they just do it because it's like ambition, but, you know, some people they've had time to reflect and kind of know.  
2:15 2:26 FEMALE:  I mean I didn't--I didn't exactly know that I wanted to be a lawyer.  But I definitely knew that--I knew that I wanted to go back to graduate school.  
2:28 2:28 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:27 2:36 FEMALE:  I wanted to get a [unintelligible] degree.  I wanted to challenge myself more intellectually.  You know, I liked what I was doing before, but I just wanted to push myself more.  
2:38 2:42 MALE:  That's good.  Yeah, that's good for working out their jobs, you know.  
2:41 2:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  
2:44 2:47 MALE:  You're done at college, and you're ready to move on to the next thing.  
2:45 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Did you go--did you come here straight from undergrad?  
2:53 2:55 MALE:  I did, yeah, yeah.  
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
2:55 3:02 MALE:  I went to school on the East Coast.  It was like super cold there.  I couldn't handle it because I'm originally from California.  
3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  Oh cool.  What part?  
3:04 3:04 MALE:  Orange County.  
3:03 3:04 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.  
3:08 3:09 MALE:  How about you?  
3:07 3:08 FEMALE:  I'm from the DC area.  
3:11 3:11 MALE:  Oh, okay, okay.  
3:11 3:14 FEMALE:  How do you like northern California versus southern California?  
3:18 3:38 MALE:  I don't know.  It's kind of different just because I was at the two places at different stages in my life.  So, now I might like think about finding  places to hang out and going out.  But like before I was--you know, say like in high school I was like so academically motivated, like I would say I was more ambitious then probably than I am now. 
3:36 3:36 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
3:38 3:40 MALE:  I guess more like a tunnel vision kind of ambition.  
3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:41 3:45 MALE:  And basically the one goal of my life was to get into a good college.  
3:44 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:47 3:53 MALE:  That's what everyone told me was important, and then I guess after getting there, I kind of started to develop wider interest to do other things.  
3:53 4:06 FEMALE:  That's good. I was the same way.  I mean I just--you know, I was very, very focused in high school.  And the years before coming to law school sort of  mellowed me out a little bit.  
4:09 4:11 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, I feel the same.  I'm kind of mellow now.  
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
4:12 4:13 MALE:  It was good meeting you.  What's your name again?  
4:12 4:12 FEMALE:  female136.  
4:14 4:15 MALE:  female136, okay.
