0:11 0:15 MALE: female230.  I have to put that down before I forget.

0:12 0:14 FEMALE: I know.  I just [unintelligible].

0:16 0:17 MALE: I know.

0:16 0:18 FEMALE: But um, it's okay.  So what do you do?

0:20 0:22 MALE: I'm a uh master's in CS.

0:20 0:21 FEMALE: CS.

0:23 0:24 MALE: How about you?  

0:22 0:23 FEMALE: Do you know nameX?

0:25 0:26 MALE: nameX?

0:23 0:24 FEMALE: nameX nameX.

0:26 0:27 MALE: nameX in lead?

0:25 0:26 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:27 0:28 MALE: Yeah.  Totally.

0:26 0:31 FEMALE: Yeah.  I met him my first--this whole time [unintelligible] it's been uh, it's been like many months since I last--since I last saw him.

0:34  0:37 MALE: Cool, no, like, nameX and I, like, we're pretty good friends, like.

0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Oh really?

0:38 0:39 MALE: We started together and everything.

0:37 0:38 FEMALE: He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.

0:39 0:41 MALE: He, he, he's a great guy.  

0:40 0:48 FEMALE: He's on my--he's on, uh, IM sometimes, so I talk to him when I get there, but because, you know, I'm in MS AND E, so we don't have, like, anything in common with you guys, so I, I don't have an excuse to [unintelligible].

0:50 0:51 MALE: How, how did you meet him?

0:49 0:50 FEMALE: Well, I don't know.  Friends of friends probably.

0:53 0:54 MALE: Cool.

0:52 0:53 FEMALE: He's a real nice guy.

0:55 0:57 MALE: It's funny because like most CS people I don't know [unintelligible].

0:55 0:56 FEMALE: Oh really.

0:58 1:03 MALE: And then you're like, do you know nameX, I'm like, well I know a nameX, but is that the same nameX, you know, and it is, you know.

1:01 1:02 FEMALE: [unintelligible].

1:04 1:05 MALE: But um.

1:03 1:16 FEMALE: Well, my CS knowledge is confined to 106B, which I thought was one of the hardest classes I ever took.  I mean, it's not hard, but it requires--like, hard in an intellectual sense, but it requires a lot of patience and perseverance to debug.  

1:18 1:19 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

1:16 1:17 FEMALE: I don't know how you guys do it in--

1:19 1:20 MALE: I don't know, it's--

1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Like, day after day.

1:21 1:27 MALE: It--I guess, like, if you started younger, you know, when you're like, freshman undergrad, you have more [unintelligible].

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Oh so your undergrad is CS too?

1:29 1:31 MALE: Yeah.  You have more, like, energy to go through that stuff, but--[unintelligible]--

1:29 1:30 FEMALE: Yeah.  Now it's old and decrepit, right, yeah.

1:32 1:40 MALE: I know, I feel the--I feel the same way, like, you know, like, before coming here, you know, I was doing some programming, so like, I feel the same way.  I feel your pain.

1:39 1:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  But so, like, where did you go for undergrad?  I mean just CS?

1:43 1:44 MALE: Here.

1:42 1:43 FEMALE: Here too?

1:44 1:45 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

1:43 1:47 FEMALE: So you, you're like sixth year or fifth year at Stanford.

1:48 1:49 MALE: Basically, yeah.  

1:47 1:48 FEMALE: Wow.

1:49 1:50 MALE: Where are you from?

1:48 1:49 FEMALE: I'm from Singapore.

1:51 1:52 MALE: Oh wow, cool.

1:50 1:52 FEMALE: Yeah my accent gives me away.  Everybody's been asking where I'm from.

1:54  1:58 MALE: No your accent--I didn't really know it was Singapore though, 'cause it's like--

1:57 1:58 FEMALE: Do you have any friends from Singapore?

2:00 2:07 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Actually I had one friend from Singapore, but she was mostly in Hong Kong so I guess it doesn't count.

2:05 2:10 FEMALE: Right.  Yeah.  A lot of Singaporeans do that.  We are--we're so, we're so globalized now, we just go everywhere.

2:12 2:24 MALE: Your accent is cool though because I, I think that, like, you can make it sound like sort of normal, so it doesn't feel like you have an accent, but every now and then, like, it's a sort of like authentic, like, semi-British, like--

2:22 2:30 FEMALE: Absolutely.  Uh in fact, there is a quite a spectrum.  My friends have told me that I can sound very different with one group of friends versus another group of friends.

2:32 2:33 MALE: I can see that.

2:31 2:32 FEMALE: I think that comes from, like--

2:34 2:35 MALE: Singaporeans, Singaporeans [unintelligible].

2:33 2:34 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah, I mean, like--

2:36 2:37 MALE: They invent words, I heard.

2:33 2:36 FEMALE: In Singapore--yeah.  It's called Singlish.

2:38 2:39 MALE: Singlish.

2:37 2:38 FEMALE: We have our very own national language.  

2:40 2:41 MALE: [laughter].

2:39 2:51 FEMALE: But I think it's just from, you know, I, I came to the States three years ago to come to college, and at Yale there's so many people with so many different accents that after a while you sort of absorb a--just hearing their voices, that's how, that's how it works, right.  

2:53 2:54 MALE: Yeah.

2:51 2:55 FEMALE: You learn people's accents because you hear them around you all the time, and then you unconsciously mimic them.

2:57 2:58 MALE: I just think--

2:55 2:57 FEMALE: So that's where I get it.

2:59 3:02 MALE: I just think yours is--I don't know, yours is unique to me.  I like--I like it.

3:00 3:02 FEMALE: Where you from?  Where are you from?

3:04 3:06 MALE: Um, I'm from Southern California.  So.

3:04 3:06 FEMALE: Okay.  So you're born here and bred here and--

3:08 3:09 MALE: Yeah.  No, no unusual--

3:07 3:11 FEMALE: You never thought of coming to the northeast?  For, like education and stuff?

3:14 3:17 MALE: I think I applied to MIT for master's, but I didn't get in, so.

3:16 3:19 FEMALE: Oh, that's okay, poor you.  You got to go to Stanford, I'm so sorry.

3:21 3:22 MALE: Well I was here for my undergraduate [unintelligible].

3:20 3:21 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:23 3:24 MALE: That was natural.

3:22 3:23 FEMALE: That was natural.

3:25 3:26 MALE: Um--

3:24 3:34 FEMALE: I went to--I went to Yale for undergrad, but then I really like Stanford.  I think you made a great choice, because if I had my undergrad years all over again, I would come to this side of the U.S.  The weather makes you so much happier.

3:36 3:37 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  

3:35 3:41 FEMALE: I mean Yale was great and all, but we actually got winter depression for the most part.  People just find it hard to get out of bed, you know, and it's like--

3:43 3:45 MALE: That sucks.  Yeah.  I can't even-

3:42 3:43 FEMALE: Snow that high and.

3:45 3:53 MALE: I can't even [unintelligible] for that.  I mean I feel bad saying it, but it's true, like, I can't even relate to that um sense of hopelessness, like.

3:51 3:52 FEMALE: [laughter].

3:54 4:00 MALE: I'm just gonna freeze.  You know, but this morning I didn't want to go to class, you know, I might be tired, but, like, it's that to, like, the Nth degree, you know.

3:58 4:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  Totally.  What's your uh--what are you--[horn] Never mind.  It really is faster than they say it is.  But, I'm female230 again, yeah.

4:07 4:08 MALE: I'm male206.

4:07 4:08 FEMALE: Yeah.  Nice to meet you.

4:09 4:10 MALE: [unintelligible].

4:08 4:09 FEMALE: Yeah.
