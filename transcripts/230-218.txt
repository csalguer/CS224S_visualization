0:00 0:05 FEMALE: I think the most ridiculous one is ambitious.  I mean, how can you tell if someone's ambitious in, like, four minutes.  [laughter]  

0:00 0:03 MALE: This is very, very difficult.  I'm just put giving straight nines.  [horn] 

0:13 0:19 FEMALE: Though thinking of the GS--maybe if people come to GSB, like telling people about what you want to do in life.

0:08 0:14 MALE: Right.  Right, if they're GSB, right, directly to 10.  Um I do Russian literature, so I guess I'm a--I'm at, like, a 1.

0:23 0:24 FEMALE: That's awesome.

0:15 0:21 MALE: I'm planning on--I'm planning on professionally borrowing money from my brother.  That's my plan.

0:30 0:32 FEMALE: What does he do?  I hope he makes money at least.

0:23 0:24 MALE: Right.  Well, I'm planning on--

0:33 0:34 FEMALE: He's an investment banker?

0:24 0:28 MALE: I'm planning on, like, sitting in his basement writing, writing abstract notes about Dostoyevsky and then--

0:37 0:40 FEMALE: Do you write in  Russian by the way?  Or do you write in English?

0:31 0:34 MALE: I can write in Russian, but like, all, all of everything, my publications in English.

0:43 0:44 FEMALE: Oh.

0:34 0:35 MALE: So.

0:44 0:46 FEMALE: Well I like writing too, but mostly for myself and my friends.  

0:37 0:38 MALE: Oh yeah?

0:46 0:49 FEMALE: Mostly poetry and short stories.  I've never tried, like, full-length novels.

0:40 0:42 MALE: Oh yeah, me too.  Me too.

0:50 0:55 FEMALE: I think if I hadn't been such a weenie, and like decided to do econ for undergrad, I would've done English lit.

0:46 0:48 MALE: So do you, do you do MBA?

0:57 1:00 FEMALE: No, right now I'm um MS and E.  Management science and engineering.

0:51 0:52 MALE: Management science, okay okay.

1:01 1:10 FEMALE: Yeah.  So I mean for me, English, like, the problem is that I love, I love lit, but I feel like the more they force me to take exams in it, the more they force me to take um, you know, just work on a thing.

1:01 1:02 MALE:  Yeah.  

1:10 1:13 FEMALE: Sometimes your passion can be involved in your work.

1:04 1:05 MALE:  Oh. 

1:13 1:16 FEMALE: It just, it starts to diminish your liking for it.  

1:06 1:07 MALE: Yeah.  

1:16 1:17 FEMALE: I don't know if you feel that way, but--

1:08 1:10 MALE: No I mean it's a really good point, because, like--

1:19 1:20 FEMALE: Sometimes [unintelligible]?

1:11 1:21 MALE: Yeah I mean, yeah, I find, I like to do literature because I love getting personally involved with it.  I love, like, I love, like insights into what's going on, and then the way you have to read it for classes all the time [unintelligible].

1:29 1:30 FEMALE: Critically, critical, yeah, literary criticism.

1:21 1:25 MALE: For some reason there's some professors where it seems like one of their goals is, like, to kill the--

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Kill the, [laughter].

1:26 1:30 MALE: Kill any sort of connection, because they find passion almost contaminates, like a detached--

1:39 1:40 FEMALE: Unacademic, a little bit, yeah?

1:31 1:41 MALE: Right.  Right.  Right.  I mean, yeah, [unintelligible] but I mean, like, a lot of times.  There was an interesting thing, like, I joke sometimes that it's cool to get paid to read books, but like, it is [unintelligible].

1:49 1:50 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:41 1:43 MALE: It is, like, in some ways like your, your interests really do sort of come under fire.

1:52 1:56 FEMALE: Do you want to be--like, maybe--you were saying you were going to write you think, after graduation, or--?

1:47 1:49 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  And actually--

1:58 2:00 FEMALE: That awesome.  Be the next Chekhov or Nikolai Gogol or something.

1:51 2:03 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, so, I've always been--I've always been a big believer that if you want to learn how to better write then it's best to--it's best to read more and become a better reader.  Um instead of, like, taking--I don't know.

2:12 2:14 FEMALE: Which is how I learned English.  I mean, I'm from Singapore.  

2:05 2:06 MALE: Oh from Singapore, okay.

2:15 2:20 FEMALE: And, you know, well, in Singapore we teach English as a first language, but I would say I never learned grammar, I never learned spelling.

2:11 2:12 MALE: Right.  

2:21 2:23 FEMALE: All I did was read ever since I was young.

2:13 2:14 MALE: And is it--?

2:23 2:26 FEMALE: And so the more you read the natural grammar--it comes to you very naturally.

2:17 2:18 MALE: It's really true.  A lot more comes through.

2:27 2:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:19 2:21 MALE: [unintelligible] in Singapore do you learn American English or British English?

2:30 2:33 FEMALE: We learn British English, so we spell color with the O-U and--

2:24 2:29 MALE: Color, right.  When I was--I was teaching--I was teaching English in Moscow and I had to teach British English.

2:38 2:39 FEMALE: Oh gosh.

2:30 2:33 MALE: It was very difficult.  You know, like, 'cause the Russians--

2:41 2:43 FEMALE: [laughter] Her accent's beginning to--

2:33 2:36 MALE: Well [unintelligible] they didn't make me speak in an accent, but--

2:45 2:46 FEMALE: Where are you from, by the way?

2:38 2:39 MALE: Colorado.

2:48 2:49 FEMALE: Colorado, okay.

2:40 2:41 MALE: Right, so very--

2:49 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah, nothing to do with Russia.

2:41 2:43 MALE: Colorado with an O.  No, no.  But color--

2:53 2:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  Nothing to do with England.

2:45 2:48 MALE: My family originally came from Russia, but it was a few generations ago.

2:57 2:58 FEMALE: Okay.  

2:48 2:50 MALE: They have nothing at all to do--nothing at all to do with England.

2:58 3:01 FEMALE: What made you passionate about Russian literature in particular?

2:52 3:00 MALE: I guess it's a combination of things.  I really like Russia.  I really like literature.  I really like Russian, the language.  I really like Russians.

3:09 3:10 FEMALE: Do you speak and write it fluently?

3:01 3:02 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  

3:11 3:12 FEMALE: Russian?  Yeah, you do?

3:03 3:08 MALE: On my writing, like, my writing--my writing probably resembles something more of like, maybe like, a high school student.

3:17 3:18 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:08 3:20 MALE: Like, if you were to sit and, like, ask me to write, like, an academic paper, like the kind of things I write in English, like, try to get in Russian, like, they just wouldn't happen.  But, like, as far as, like, talking about my day or, like, e-mails to friends, like, like sort of--

3:29 3:30 FEMALE: You'll do fine?

3:21 3:27 MALE: Right, like describing maybe, like a funny, funny story about you know, speed dating, I think I could get that across.

3:35 3:37 FEMALE: [unintelligible] which parts of uh Russia have you been to?

3:29 3:37 MALE: A lot.  You know, I've lived in Petersburg, I've lived in Moscow, I've been down to the Black Sea, I've been up on the Finnish border.  I've been all around the West.  I've been, like--

3:46 3:49 FEMALE: I've heard St. Petersburg's a beautiful, like--

3:40 3:41 MALE: St. Petersburg's beautiful.

3:50 3:51 FEMALE: Very classical big city.

3:42 3:43 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry--

3:51 3:52 FEMALE: Architecture.

3:43 3:44 MALE: Is it female230?

3:53 3:54 FEMALE: female230, sorry, yeah.

3:44 3:45 MALE: female230.  That's right, that's right.

3:54 3:55 FEMALE: [unintelligible].

3:46 3:48 MALE: Yeah I was blocking it for a while too, I had it all covered up.

3:57 3:58 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:48 3:53 MALE: Yeah um, St. Petersburg, you should really give that a go if you ever get a chance, 'cause St. Petersburg is just like a--

4:03 4:04 FEMALE: Does it have waterways there, like--

3:55 3:56 MALE: Yeah.  

4:04 4:06 FEMALE: That's the, kind of the pictures I see.

3:57 4:01 MALE: They call it the Venice of the North, right, so it's got--it's got all the rivers there.  It's got like all the bridges going over.

4:10 4:19 FEMALE: The only thing I see with Russia is that, and it's reflected in Russian [horn] is [unintelligible] society is, like, having so many problems right now, you know?  Alcoholism for one.

4:10 4:11 MALE: The population is decreasing.  Wow, well--

4:19 4:22 FEMALE: 'Cause they're all too drunk.  It was nice to meet you.

4:13 4:15 MALE: That was very fast female230.

4:24 4:25 FEMALE: Yeah.
