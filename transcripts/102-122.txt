0:03 0:03 MALE: I'm male102.
0:04 0:04 FEMALE: female122.
0:04 0:05 MALE: Nice to meet you.
0:05 0:06 FEMALE: Yeah, good to meet you.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  How's it going?
0:07 0:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, getting started here [laughter].  Okay, where are you from?
0:11 0:13 MALE:  I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio.
0:13 0:15 FEMALE:  Okay.  Where did you go to college?
0:15 0:19 MALE:  I went to the University of Illinois in UrbanaChampaign.
0:19 0:19 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:20 0:31 MALE:  And studied Engineering and Philosophy there, and really liked Philosophy and really didn't like Engineering, and so I ended up staying for a Masters Program there in Philosophy Education, and that's what I do here.  I'm in Philosophy Education.
0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:32 0:32 MALE:  Yeah.
0:33 0:38 FEMALE:  Great.  So [unintelligible] and I went to school up in Washington State.
0:38 0:38 MALE:  Uh huh.
0:40 0:43 FEMALE:  A small college up there, [unintelligible].  [unintelligible].
0:44 0:44 MALE:  Uh huh.
0:44 0:46 FEMALE:  Worked at [unintelligible] last year.
0:46 0:47 MALE:  Oh really?
0:47 0:51 FEMALE:  [unintelligible], an [unintelligible] program out here so.
0:52 0:54 MALE:  That's really, what did you do at NIH?
0:54 0:56 FEMALE:  I was working in fly lab, fruit fly lab.
0:57 0:57 MALE:  Really?
0:58 0:58 FEMALE: [unintelligible].
0:59 1:08 MALE:  My sister just spent the last year working at NIH as well and I couldn't tell you.  She's doing something related to genetic Epidemiology.
1:08 1:09 FEMALE:  Really?
1:09 1:15 MALE:  And she's starting a Masters in Public Health and Epidemiology at the University of Washington next year.
1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:17 1:18 MALE:  Yeah.
1:19 1:19 FEMALE:  Seattle.
1:19 1:40 MALE:  In Seattle, yeah.  So she's very excited, yes.  She's a Midwest, she was like me.  She grew up in the Midwest and then going to D.C. was a big step leaving her family and then I think it will be really good for her to come out to the west coast.  And I'll get to see her a lot more often obviously because we're a lot closer than Washington.
1:40 1:47 FEMALE:  That's great.  Yeah, just one year in the east coast helped me.  It was fun for me.  It was just different but [unintelligible].
1:48 1:50 MALE:  How did you feel it was different than being out here?
1:52 1:53 FEMALE:  People were just [unintelligible].
1:54 1:54 MALE:  Yeah.
1:55 2:04 FEMALE:  Talking to my roommates, they had never been camping and trying to explain what smores are and campfires and campfire songs and [unintelligible] and all that.
2:04 2:04 MALE:  Really?
2:05 2:15 FEMALE:  Well, yeah, but [unintelligible].  So it wasn't just like [unintelligible].  It was international [unintelligible].
2:16 2:16 MALE:  Cool.
2:17 2:18 FEMALE:  It's good to [unintelligible].
2:19 2:25 MALE:  Yeah.  That's something that's really lacking out there that's sort of disappointing.  But you would expect it to be a little bit better than it is.
2:25 2:26 FEMALE:  Do you like the Bart?
2:26 2:45 MALE:  Uh, you know what?  I've only ridden Bart a couple of times when I was usually when I'm coming from the airport or whatever.  But I live in Midland Park so I'm always down here.  In fact, I'm in the process -- I normally drive to campus, but I'm in the process of trying to get a bike so I can actually start commuting that way.
2:46 2:47 FEMALE:  What year are you in your program?
2:48 2:48 MALE:  I'm a second year.
2:48 2:50 FEMALE:  Second year.  How long is the program?
2:51 3:01 MALE:  It's basically a four or five year program.  Its three years of classes and then however long it takes you to go and finish your dissertation pretty much.  What about you?
3:02 3:03 FEMALE:  So I'm first year.
3:03 3:04 MALE:  Oh okay.
3:04 3:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a five year program.
3:07 3:10 MALE:  And then you typically do a postop after you finish or?
3:10 3:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, most people do.  So I think I'll do that track and I want to teach eventually.
3:15 3:16 MALE:  Oh okay.
3:16 3:18 FEMALE:  Maybe small college like I was at.
3:20 3:23 MALE:  Cool.  That's real nice.  What small college did you say you went to?
3:23 3:25 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] University.
3:25 3:26 MALE:  I'm not familiar with that.
3:26 3:34 FEMALE:  It's in Tacoma.  South of Seattle there and small school but [unintelligible].
3:34 3:35 MALE:  You enjoyed your time there?
3:35 3:37 FEMALE:  I did.  Yeah.
3:38 3:41 MALE:  Did you do the Biological Sciences while you were there as well?
3:41 3:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  That was most of my majors, bio and chem., but they had [unintelligible] requirements, so I went to a good Liberal Arts School like that because I got the [unintelligible] in Philosophy.
3:52 3:52 MALE:  Right.
3:52 3:54 FEMALE:  I played in the orchestra.
3:55 3:59 MALE:  Oh that's cool.  [laughter]  Well it was --
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, good to meet you.
4:01 4:02 MALE:  Really nice meeting you.
4:02 4:03 FEMALE:  Okay.
