0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Oh, first person.

1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  You're from France?  

1:41 1:54 MALE:  And I'm here for a few months, for a the spring quarter for an internship in my chemical engineering department and that's all -- do you enjoy the place here?

1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

2:08 2:10 FEMALE:  [laughter].  

2:10 2:12 MALE:  It's a pity because the campus is so amazing and the --  

2:12 2:24 FEMALE:  It's a pity.  It's a pity we all agree.  Yeah it's depressing to see the [unintelligible] where there are swimming pools and then the next time you are [unintelligible]. 

2:24 2:25  MALE:  Yes I know what you are talking about because I enjoy it every day I can go to the swimming pool, I can do anything I want. 

2:33 2:33  FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

2:34 2:35 MALE:  I'm sorry, I am not have time for instance, because I've just arrived, but I'm rushing --

3:17 3:22 MALE:  [unintelligible] I don't think I know them, because I know quite a lot of French students here. 

3:21 3:22 FEMALE:  There are many? 

3:22 3:25 MALE:  Only of my school, we are about 25 I think, so I find it's -- yes it's a huge number and I don't know exactly for all the student or for all the French students, but we are, I think at least 50 yes. 

3:40 3:40 FEMALE:  But probably you're over-represented in chemical engineering?  [unintelligible] and in school it's like the first time they have a friend from the same -- oh [unintelligible].
