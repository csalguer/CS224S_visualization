0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:20 0:20 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  Sorry about that.  I'm like--
0:23 0:24 MALE:  [interposing]  Well, it's getting so hard.  
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  I know.  It's so many questions in one minute, right?  
0:26 0:26 MALE:  Yeah.
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  Are you having fun?  
0:27 0:28 MALE:  I am.  It's actually pretty cool.  
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
0:29 0:30 MALE:  Yeah, not bad.  
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  It doesn't happen often, right?  
0:32 0:38 MALE:  No, I'm trying to think what are my Thursday nights, working in the lab mostly.  
0:38 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, what kind of lab?
0:40 0:40 MALE:  Robotics.
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  Robotics?  
0:41 0:43 MALE:  Yeah, mechanical engineer.  
0:43 0:45 FEMALE:  Interesting.  There are a bunch of you guys floating around.  
0:45 0:45 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  
0:45 0:48 FEMALE:  All a bunch of engineers.  I [unintelligible] might be the first ME person.  
0:49 0:50 MALE:  I'm guessing they were mostly electrical.  
0:51 0:51 FEMALE:  Yes.  
0:53 0:54 MALE:  That's the face of [unintelligible].
0:54 0:56 FEMALE:  It's the [unintelligible] apparently.  I've learned not to [unintelligible].  
0:57 0:58 MALE:  Yeah, we're kind of like [unintelligible].  
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  Are you Master's, Phd?
1:00 1:00 MALE:  PhD.
1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  PhD, how far along?  
1:02 1:08 MALE:  I am working on my Master's so that I can start my PhD and go through [unintelligible] next year.  So, kind of Master's.  
1:08 1:15 FEMALE:  Do you know [unintelligible]?  No?  He's another one of the ME folks, finishing his Master's.  
1:15 1:16 MALE:  Ah, do you know what division?  
1:18 1:20 FEMALE:  No, give me some options.
1:21 1:29 MALE:  Design, computation, biomechanics, fluid.  
1:29 1:30 FEMALE: How many of you are there?
1:30 1:34 MALE: Last year there were 200 new master's students.  
1:34 1:40 FEMALE:  Oh, my god.  Are you kidding?  I had no idea.  No wonder everybody here is an engineer.  There are tons of you.
1:40 1:43 MALE: I think in electrical there were actually 800 new electricals.  
1:43 1:44 FEMALE:  Really?  
1:45 1:53 MALE:  Yeah.  If you ever ask an electrical engineer do you know someone else, chances are they're going to ask you what lab does he work in, and if you answer wrong to that, they're going to say no.  
1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  I had no idea.
1:54 1:54 MALE: What department are you in?
1:54 1:55 FEMALE: I'm at the ed school. 
1:55 1:56 MALE: Oh, right on.  
1:57 1:58 FEMALE: It's like [unintelligible].  
1:58 1:59 MALE:  Do you know Donna Winston?  
2:00 2:04 FEMALE:  I know of her.  I mean I could pick her out of a crowd, but I don't know--
2:05 2:06 MALE:  She's my CA.  
2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.  
2:08 2:09 MALE:  That's the only other ed person I know.  
2:10 2:12 FEMALE:  We're in a much smaller crew.  
2:12 2:13 MALE:  So, what are you studying in education.
2:13 2:16 FEMALE:  I'm doing a Master's in quality organization and leadership.
2:17 2:17 MALE:  Oh, cool.  
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  Fun stuff.  
2:19 2:27 MALE:  I have a friend who just got done doing a PhD in literacy, and, uh, assessment instruments used in elementary schools.  
2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  Great, we need that.  
2:28 2:29 MALE:  Pretty neat stuff.  
2:29 2:34 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a good field to be in right now, a lot of literacy stuff happening.  
2:35 2:36 MALE:  So, how are you enjoying this evening?  
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  This evening?  
2:38 2:38 MALE:  Well, yeah.  
2:39 2:39 FEMALE:  It's been fun, you know.  Why not?  
2:40 2:41 MALE:  It's kind of the start of the evening.  
2:42 2:47 FEMALE:  Right, well yeah.  I mean this is [unintelligible].  
2:47 2:49 MALE:  It's I.  I started at "e".  
2:50 2:56 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, well, but we have numbers too see right here.  So, it's--that's the only way I can really keep up.  
2:56 2:56 MALE:  I'm not too good at that.  
2:57 3:27 FEMALE:  No, it's been fun. I mean I feel like it will [unintelligible] my program only has 17 people in it.  So, it's great because we're meeting people--I mean it's a one-year program, nine months, you're in and out, but we've jelled so well and so quickly that we're like one big sort of great friends, which is wonderful when you're in someplace for nine months.  But we don't ever really get to like go out and meet other people because we love each other so much.  That has pros and cons.  
3:28 3:47 MALE:  That's kind of what happened to me.  I'm taking a sequence this year called ME218, and it's just a whole bunch of really big design projects.  And we work in teams 3 and 4.  And pretty much--this is finally over this quarter, but last quarter and fall quarter it was spending close to 30 hours in the lab each week working with those three people.  
3:48 3:48 FEMALE:  It's intense.  
3:48 3:50 MALE:  So, I got to know those three people really well.  
3:50 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, it can be great.
3:53 3:53 MALE:  Yeah.
3:53 3:54 FEMALE:  But it can also--
3:55 4:04 MALE:  [interposing]  Well, one of my team members was married, and I was joking with him, uh, toward the end of last quarter, you know, I've seen you more than you've seen your wife. And he was like--
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  [interposing]  That was like no joke at all.  
4:06 4:06 MALE:  yeah.  
4:07 4:08 FEMALE:  That's true.  Well, have fun tonight.  
4:09 4:09 MALE:  Thanks
4:09 4:09 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
4:10 4:10 MALE:  Thanks you too.
