0:12 0:12 FEMALE: Hi.

0:01 0:02 MALE: Hi. 

0:13 0:14 FEMALE: [laughter] 

0:02 0:04 MALE: So you're letter E?

0:15 0:15 FEMALE: A.

0:05 0:08 MALE: A, oh okay, okay.  And your name's female121.

0:16 0:16 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:10 0:11 MALE: Sorry female121, nice to meet you.

0:21 0:24 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  Are you having fun?

0:14 0:17 MALE: Yeah.  It seems it's going pretty well actually.

0:28 0:29 FEMALE: Good, excellent.

0:18 0:19 MALE: So what do you think about this?

0:31 0:34 FEMALE: I'm a little shell shocked.  I don't really know.  It's like so--

0:24 0:27 MALE: Fast, right?  And you don't even have to move.  [laughter] 

0:38 0:41 FEMALE: No.  [laughter] Exactly.  The added struggle of having to move.

0:30 0:30 MALE: Yeah.

0:43 0:51 FEMALE: Yeah, it's kind of-I didn't know what to expect so it's-I didn't really have any-I didn't anticipate anything in particular.  So um, it's kind of fun to see how it works.

0:40 0:45 MALE: Uh huh, yeah, same with me.  I just said I'll go and try it out.

0:56 0:56 FEMALE: Right.

0:46 0:49 MALE: At the worst I am like I am now, you know?  [laughter] 

1:00 1:02 FEMALE: [laughter] That's right, it can't be any worse.

0:51 0:51 MALE: Exactly.

1:03 1:04 FEMALE: What um, program are you in?

0:53 0:54 MALE: I'm in physics.

1:05 1:12 FEMALE: In physics.  Yeah, I'm in the ed school so we heard about this first because I have a class with Professor nameX who's running it.

1:01 1:02 MALE: Oh really?

1:12 1:17 FEMALE: So he, in class, was handing out the forms during class.

1:06 1:08 MALE: I think this is a great idea, in fact.

1:18 1:19 FEMALE: Yeah, it's fun.

1:09 1:14 MALE: I am then curious to know about the results.  So I think it's the first time I have participated in a social study of any kind.

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Oh really?

1:15 1:16 MALE: Or at least that I know of.

1:27 1:31 FEMALE: Uh huh.  Exactly.  [laughter]  At least you're being obvious in this one and you know.  

1:21 1:21 MALE: Yeah.

1:32 1:32 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:22 1:24 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  But I think it is a very good idea.

1:35 1:39 FEMALE: Yeah.  I don't know how long he's expecting it to take to get the results.

1:29 1:32 MALE: Yeah, I don't know either.  So I'm going to be here for a while so I'm pretty sure.

1:43 1:45 FEMALE: [laughter] How long is your program?

1:35 1:40 MALE: Well, I mean, a PhD normally takes five or six years, and I'm on my third year so.

1:50 1:54 FEMALE: [laughter] So you're part of the way through though.  That's promising.

1:44 1:44 MALE: Yeah, exactly.

1:55 1:56 FEMALE: It's not your first year.

1:46 1:48 MALE: Exactly, at least I didn't quit right away, right?

2:00 2:01 FEMALE: It's a long time.

1:50 1:51 MALE: In what year are you?

2:02 2:07 FEMALE: I'm just doing a one year masters so it's really, really--  [laughter]  So I'll be done in June.

1:56 1:59 MALE: Wow.  And are you sad about that or are you very excited?

2:11 2:32 FEMALE: Um, I'm torn.  I'll be sad to leave campus and I made a lot of good friends here so I'll be sorry to go, but, but um, it's a lot of work, and so it will be nice to have a job, and be in a regular schedule, and live in a real apartment, and have a real life.  So it's interesting.  There are pros and cons to both sides so--

2:20 2:30 MALE: I know, I know.  I think the difference between the student life and the real work life, you have to go to the real work life at some point anyway, right?

2:41 2:42 FEMALE: [laughter] 

2:31 2:31 MALE: [laughter] 

2:42 2:46 FEMALE: Well I was working and then I came back to school, so I'm used to it, so.  I used to--

2:34 2:36 MALE: Oh okay, oh.  Too bad.

2:47 2:48 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.

2:37 2:38 MALE: Because I'm not.

2:49 2:50 FEMALE: [laughter] 

2:39 2:41 MALE: I've been always studying you know.

2:52 2:52 FEMALE: Oh really?

2:41 2:48 MALE: Yeah, I mean, I know I will move on to something more like real work life.

2:58 3:01 FEMALE: Do you want to teach when you're done, or do research, or--?

2:50 2:54 MALE: Well, actually I don't know for sure.  Probably work first and then decide.  I don't know.

3:06 3:07 FEMALE: You've got time.  [laughter] 

2:56 2:58 MALE: I have time.  I guess.

3:09 3:10 FEMALE: You'll have time here to figure it out.

3:00 3:01 MALE: Yeah, absolutely.

3:12 3:17 FEMALE: Interesting.  Interesting.  So what do you do for fun around the area?

3:06 3:12 MALE: I go--  So lately I'm exploring places.  Like I went to Yosemite, I went to Tahoe.

3:22 3:23 FEMALE: Oh you did?

3:12 3:15 MALE: I went to Vegas.  Yeah.

3:25 3:26 FEMALE: [laughter] How was Vegas?

3:16 3:17 MALE: Oh it's awesome, have you been?

3:28 3:30 FEMALE: No I've never seen Vegas.  [laughter] 

3:19 3:20 MALE: Oh okay, where are you from?

3:31 3:32 FEMALE: Connecticut, on the East Coast.

3:21 3:23 MALE: Okay, okay.  You have to go.

3:34 3:35 FEMALE: I would love to go.

3:23 3:25 MALE: It's really cheap from here.

3:36 3:42 FEMALE: I know.  I'm trying to get a job in San Francisco so I hope they all stay in the area and it will be cheap for me to fly.

3:31 3:31 MALE: Yeah.

3:43 3:44 FEMALE: And it's so close.

3:33 3:41 MALE: It's close like--and actually the nice thing about it is that on your flight you can see the whole of California because you go across the whole California.

3:52 3:53 FEMALE: Right.

3:42 3:43 MALE: And it's like seeing the map.

3:54 3:54 FEMALE: Right.

3:44 3:48 MALE: Really, it looks the same as in the map--that you can see all the lakes and mountains, everything.

3:59 4:00 FEMALE: Right.

3:49 3:49 MALE: I love it.

4:01 4:02 FEMALE: It's beautiful.

3:51 3:54 MALE: It's really, really beautiful.  Do you realize how beautiful California is?

4:05 4:08 FEMALE: And how long would--  [horn]  How long did you stay in Vegas?

3:58 3:59 MALE: Just three days.

4:10 4:11 FEMALE: Was that the right amount of time?

4:00 4:01 MALE: I think so.  That's enough.

4:12 4:13 FEMALE: Yeah.  [laughter]  

4:03 4:05 MALE: Okay, Very nice to meet you.

4:15 4:16 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  Have fun tonight.
