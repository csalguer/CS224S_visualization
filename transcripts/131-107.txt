0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:12 0:15 MALE:  I know.  It's like--but that's what they're studying.  So, you should do it.  
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:18 0:30 MALE:  Let me just go fast.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, [unintelligible].  
0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  Where are you from?  
0:32 0:32 MALE:  I'm from India.  
0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Yeah, okay?  
0:33 0:34 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  Okay.  What part of India are you from?  
0:36 0:43 MALE:  I'm from northern India. So, I'm from a place near Delhi.  I [unintelligible] in New Delhi, and then I was in Banglo, South India, and then I came here.  
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  Do you like to--oh, what department are you in?  
0:46 0:47 MALE:  I'm in the school of education.  
0:37 0:38 FEMALE:  Oh, the school of education.  
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  So, interesting.  
0:49 0:51 MALE:  Yeah, I'm an engineer moving to social sciences.  
0:41 0:45 FEMALE:  Okay, so you [unintelligible].  Do you know that I [unintelligible]?  
0:54 0:57 MALE:  No, I wasn't that intelligent entering the [unintelligible] school in Delhi.  
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:58 0:59 MALE:  Yeah, and then I moved to [unintelligible].  
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  And why [unintelligible] vacation?  
1:02 1:19 MALE:  So, I think there are programs here for learning sciences and technology design that looks at the use of technology for learning issues.  So, I'm really interested in that, and I study that within organizations and how people are working together use technology and others that affect learning and [unintelligible], those kinds of issues.  
1:10 1:13 FEMALE:  I mean what's an example of like [unintelligible] how people act?  
1:24 1:48 MALE:  There are a lot of knowledge management systems that companies use.  So, like the one is--you [unintelligible] know what site and you're looking at some intersting web page.  And the system will tell you somebody within your organization is going to be searching on something like that and whether they are published and if you [unintelligible] so that kind of comes up so you have an understanding of who is doing what within your organization so then you can run.  
1:38 1:41 FEMALE: It's not so much helping people on an individual basis learn like-
1:51 1:53 MALE:  [interposing]  No, it's more social things, institutional and social.  
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  That's actually-I mean I can imagine that would be a really-
1:57 1:58 MALE:  [interposing]  Which department are you in?  
1:48 1:49 FEMALE:  I'm in the law department.  
1:59 2:00 MALE:  You're in the law, okay.  
1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, well I [unintelligible].  
2:02 2:02 MALE:  Okay.  
1:53 1:56 FEMALE:  Yeah, but [unintelligible] works in the private sector for it is great to have.  
2:07 2:07 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:58 2:01 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] and [crosstalk].  
2:12 2:12 MALE:  Oh, my gosh.  
2:03 2:04 FEMALE:  Does he work in the [unintelligible]?  
2:15 2:25 MALE:  Just like I was in organizations looking at how they work and within this firm that I'm working with right now for my dissertation.  It's amazing the amount of [unintelligible] density they have within organizations.  
2:15 2:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, and, you know, it's the same wherever you go.  I mean you get into even I bet GD and that and they have great reputations and things.  
2:33 2:33 MALE:  Right.  
2:24 2:26 FEMALE:  Can you talk about who you're working with, or is that-
2:36 2:38 MALE:  [interposing]  No, that's confidential.  
2:28 2:29 FEMALE:  Yeah, I figured it might be.  
2:40 2:52 MALE:  It's a research lab, and I looked [unintelligible] people who are in different--have [unintelligible] for different part of the world.  So, this lab is U.S. and Japan.  So, the company I [unintelligible] work with was U.S., Europe and India.  
2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:53 2:55 MALE:  So, I go and do field studies and other places.  
2:45 2:50 FEMALE:  It must be really fascinating to observe a lot of these organizations in both the U.S. and Japanese company.  
3:01 3:01 MALE:  Right.  
2:51 2:56 FEMALE:  But we were doing a lot of [unintelligible], working with--and I worked with a lot of Japanese companies.  
3:06 3:06 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:57 3:06 FEMALE:  And even though I'm not Japanese by like knowing a little bit of the culture, I mean even like you being from another Asian country [unintelligible] how to like-
3:16 3:18 MALE:  [interposing]  That's what I've been told, yeah.  
3:08 3:11 FEMALE:  I don't want to make any value judgments, but [unintelligible].  
3:22 3:32 MALE:  Right, right, and then [unintelligible] this is a Japanese company, which has an R&D office in the U.S., which is working with R&D in Japan.  
3:22 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:32 3:38 MALE:  So, it's a really different equation.  So, what kinds of things do you look at, and what are you studying within law?  
3:29 3:38 FEMALE:  Actually, to get back to law school was a complete career change.  I was working in finance before, and I've actually always been interested in the legal system.  
3:49 3:50 MALE:  Okay.  
3:40 3:42 FEMALE:  So, I'm actually very interested in the legal [unintelligible] and liberties.  
3:52 3:53 MALE:  Okay.  
3:43 3:53 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] client or classes of people that they've discriminated against for race.  I'm sure they can't [unintelligible] there.  It's very different.  
4:04 4:07 MALE:  Yeah, that's interesting.  I moved from engineering to social science.  
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
4:09 4:11 MALE:  And it helps, a different background helps a lot actually.
