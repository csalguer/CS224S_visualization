0:34 0:42 MALE:  I mean, I don't know, I'd like to think that most people are at least above a five.  In this environment I think it would be pretty weird to not be friendly.
0:43 0:44 FEMALE:  This is true.  This is true.
0:45 0:45 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:46 0:54 FEMALE:  But also too, there's strange people everywhere you go.  You know, you never really know.  So tell me a little bit about yourself.

1:11 1:12 FEMALE:  That's nice.
1:12 1:14 MALE:  Um, tell me a little bit about yourself.
1:14 1:28 FEMALE:  Well, I'm a first year Masters student too, except for only one year program and um, I actually used to work in software developments, so I'm a big fan of programmers.  Although I've never been one myself um -
1:28 1:29 MALE:  What's your program?
1:30 1:35 FEMALE:  Learning, Design and Technology so it's useful of education here.  So, I'm out in June.  
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Nice.
1:37 1:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I gotta say.  So, yeah and I too, I have to say of all the sports, I'm not a very athletic person, I'm not a very sports oriented person, but baseball, I'll go to a baseball game.
1:47 1:57 MALE:  It's good, 'cause you can go to a game and like it can be fun, it can be boring, it doesn't matter, you don't have to watch the game, you can just chill and enjoy the nice day, you know,
1:57 2:00 FEMALE:  Exactly.  So do you go out to the ballpark often?
2:00 2:04 MALE:  Um, I went to a game a couple weeks ago actually.  Giants game.
2:04 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, have you been to the new stadium?
2:06 2:07 MALE:  Yeah.
2:07 2:11 FEMALE:  I've only ever passed by it, I haven't been to it a Giants game since Candlestick.
2:10 2:19 MALE:  No, when you have the time you should go.  I mean yeah, you should go.  So I went and like it's just so picturesque.  We were sitting right behind home plate, you know, and -
2:19 2:20 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.
2:20 2:25 MALE:  And the stadium is such that here's home plate, and then like stadium and then like the bay right over the wall.
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Oh, beautiful.
2:26 2:28 MALE:  You can basically watch the sunset into the bay.
2:29 2:30 FEMALE:  Hey.
2:30 2:31 MALE:  And the game was pretty boring, so.  [laughter]
2:32 2:36 FEMALE:  So there's alternatives just in case nobody's hitting homers.  
2:37 2:38 MALE:  Yeah.
2:38 2:46 FEMALE:  That's great.  That's great.  My -- I've actually been to a couple local baseball games.  Like the local minor league.
2:46 2:47 MALE:  Oh, really.
2:47 2:54 FEMALE:  I grew up in San Jose and so every once in a while [unintelligible] the minors there and um, that's real.  You know, they got the barbecue out back.
2:54 3:06 MALE:  [unintelligible] there's always one like heckler, you know, like the serious heckler.  It's like every time the opponents come up to bat he's just like being really obnoxious and you can actually communicate with the players, you know.
3:06 3:15 FEMALE:  Exactly.  I mean you could see the whites of their eyes, you know, it's great.  You know, and they got the cheerleaders and everybody's into it and the families and kids, it's fun.
3:16 3:19 MALE:  I've never actually watched a minor league game.
3:20 3:24 FEMALE:  I highly recommend it.  I have to say.  I don't know if Palo Alto has a team, I kind of doubt it.
3:24 3:29 MALE:  I don't know.  I think like, if I could be doing anything else, it would be playing baseball.
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  You would be playing baseball.  
3:30 3:31 MALE:  Like, if I could -
3:31 3:32 FEMALE:  Alternate life?
3:32 3:33 MALE:  Yeah.
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  [laughter].  
3:37 3:41 MALE:  It's like the only game where most of the time you don't have to do anything, you just like have to be in the mode and -
3:41 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, you just gotta be in the spirit, you know, on the bench.
3:44 3:46 MALE:  Not like basketball where you're running and running and -
3:46 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's exhausting. [laughter]  You could just get up for your turn, you know.
3:51 3:53 MALE:  Yeah, go back, take a rest.
3:53 4:11 FEMALE:  Go back, hang out, spit, scratch yourself, like whatever it takes.  Hang out, drink some beers, it's all good.  So I have the utmost respect for baseball.  But actually, in terms of activities I actually like to dance.
4:12 4:12 MALE:  Oh, really?
4:12 4:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I like to go out dancing, so.
4:14 4:15 MALE:  What kind of dancing?
4:16 4:25 FEMALE:  Pretty much any kind.  I'm not a good dancer, but I like to dance.  It was very nice to meet you [unintelligible].  Yeah.  Great talking to you.
