00:02 00:04 FEMALE: So, uh, what's--are you in business school here?  
00:21 00:28 MALE: Un, no.  I'm in the, uh, I'm getting a master's in double E and I'm getting a Ph.D. in physics.  
00:12 00:18 FEMALE: Both?  How do you both at the same time?  Is it first with the physics and then you'll apply for the master's in EE or no?  
00:36 00:45 MALE: No, I entered the Ph.D. program in physics first and then I work with the professor in the [unintelligible] area so I took a bunch of classes.  
00:28 00:29 FEMALE: Okay.  
00:45 00:51 MALE: Classes in, uh, double E, department of [unintelligible] why don't you just get--
00:33 00:41 FEMALE: Get a masters.  Is that a problem?  Because, I mean, the physics program is paying you, right?  Like, your stipend?  Well, then you're using, like, you're getting a master's--
01:00 01:04 MALE: My stipend comes from--research comes from my advisers.    
00:48 00:52 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  So it's not quite the same.  Okay.  Cool.  What year are you?  
01:11 01:12 MALE: I'm in the sixth year.  
00:55 00:57 FEMALE: Sixth year.  Wow.  How many more years?  
01:15 01:17 MALE: Uh, applying for five, probably.  
01:00 01:01 FEMALE: Five more years?  
01:18 01:21 MALE: Applying for five.  So...
01:04 01:05 FEMALE: [laughter] I don't understand.  
01:23 01:26 MALE: I need to be here for another ten to five years.  
01:09 01:10 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
01:27 01:28 MALE: For, like, three months.  
01:11 01:17 FEMALE: Okay, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I understand.  I thought you meant another five years, like, eleven years altogether.  That's a lot of time.  [laughter] 
01:35 01:37 MALE: So I have seen people told me they've been here for more than ten years.  
01:21 01:21 FEMALE: Seriously?  
01:38 01:38 MALE: Yeah.  
01:22 01:23 FEMALE: Ph.D. in physics or EE?  
01:40 01:41 MALE: Ph.D. in physics and EE.
01:25 01:31 FEMALE: Really.  How old, I mean, do they look really old and, like, real tired or do they look really happy, like, I still don't have a job, you know?  [laughter] 
01:50 01:59 MALE: I think if they had decided to stay here for more than ten years they are pretty much happy with their life because they would have dropped out if they were not happy.  
01:43 02:17 FEMALE: Yeah.  I know somebody in the English department who, um, is my [unintelligible] English, and they haven't finished their Ph.D. but they just hang around campus and they go to all the free food events.  So they know every single place that has free food and the sleep in line [unintelligible] so nobody--so they have free housing, they have all the free food, they have intellectual life on campus, you know, all the free events.  You go to the bookstore or our read until, like, you can be like a homeless person but it's like just hanging around campus.  It's funny, so, yeah.  So it's like a bulletin, like, free food at this event.  Quickly go, you know.  [laughter] Some of the people are like that.  
02:36 02:40 MALE: Yeah, so probably.  So you're an English major?  
02:23 02:38 FEMALE: Yes, um, poetry basically, and also a little bit of philosophy.  So I'm, I want to be a professor.  So to teach English and poetry at the university level, so.  And you want to do what?  Because you're physics and EE, so what do you want to do?  
02:56 02:57 MALE: Research.  
02:40 02:43 FEMALE: And so you want to be a professor or not necessarily a professor, but...
03:00 03:06 MALE: Probably not a professor, but, uh, an employee in [unintelligible] big company.  
02:49 02:52 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  Like in California or San Francisco or any--
03:09 03:11 MALE: Probably on the East Coast.  
02:54 02:54 FEMALE: Why East Coast?  
03:12 03:15 MALE: Because I think the big companies are there.  
02:58 02:59 FEMALE: Like who?  
03:17 03:19 MALE: Uh, G.E. has a research center in New York.
03:02 03:03 FEMALE: Okay, okay.  
03:21 03:23 MALE: Phillips has a research center in Ohio.    
03:06 03:09 FEMALE: Okay.  Ohio is boring.  [laughter] yeah.  
03:27 03:30 MALE: Um, Siemens has a research center in [unintelligible] Princeton.  
03:12 03:19 FEMALE: Okay.  So you know the companies you want, kind of to--did you, um, did you go to undergrad here or?  
03:37 03:41 MALE: I went for undergrad in the University of China.  
03:23 03:24 FEMALE: Where in--
03:43 03:44 MALE: In the--in the south part.  
03:27 03:32 FEMALE: Okay.  I only know--I have Chinese friends, like, Taiwan, but that's not even China.  [unintelligible] 
03:52 03:53 MALE: Taiwan's the island.  
03:36 03:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  
03:57 03:58 MALE: Quandon [phonetic] is probably the topmost province in Malay.  
03:39 03:40 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  
03:59 04:03 MALE: My home province is to the north of [unintelligible] 
03:44 03:45 FEMALE: Oh, cool.  [Chinese] 
04:04 04:05 MALE: [Chinese] 
03:45 03:58 FEMALE: [laughter] [Chinese] That's all I know.  I know [Chinese].  Is that Cantonese or Mandarin?  
04:16 04:17 MALE: Mandarin.  
03:59 04:02 FEMALE: Mandarin.  Okay.  What's more popular, Mandarin or Cantonese?  
04:19 04:21 MALE: Mandarin is the official language.  
04:04 04:06 FEMALE: And then in Taiwan do they speak Mandarin as well or do they speak Cantonese?  
04:24 04:25 MALE: Very similar to Mandarin.  [unintelligible] 
04:09 04:27 FEMALE: Okay, okay.  But you can understand everything [unintelligible].  So is it hard for you to be in--I mean you speak, actually, pretty well.  I understand everything.  But is it difficult to be studying physics in, like, a different language?  Like if I had to study something in a whole different language it would be difficult.  
04:44 04:49 MALE: Yeah, there are certain obstacles but physics is not like literature.   
04:31 04:33 FEMALE: Yeah, literature is [unintelligible] what does this word mean, you know?  
04:52 05:01 MALE: Some, you have some you probably have to understand, uh, like every word.  Physics, you can still use another language, the math language or [unintelligible] 
04:43 04:51 FEMALE: And that's the same all the way around.  Why Stanford?  Why did you pick Stanford?  I mean, because you're in China, right?  Okay, America, but why Stanford?  
05:12 05:15 MALE: Uh, because the program here is probably one of the best in the world.  
04:57 04:57 FEMALE: For physics?  
05:16 05:16 MALE: Yeah.  
04:58 04:59 FEMALE: Oh.  I didn't know that.  
05:19 05:24 MALE: Stanford got the Nobel Price three time year in a row from '96 to 1998.  05:07 05:12 FEMALE: Wow, okay.  Sweet.  That's really cool.  Um, you said you're doing solar something?  
05:30 05:31 MALE: Um, medical physics.  
05:14 05:14 FEMALE: Medical physics.  
05:33 05:33 MALE: Yeah.  
05:15 05:15 FEMALE: What does that mean?  
05:35 05:39 MALE: It means--heard of MR, actually?  So I combine them.  
05:21 05:22 FEMALE: Like MRIs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
05:40 05:41 MALE: So I work on those things.    
05:24 05:29 FEMALE: So that's, like, actually something that can help people too.  That's really cool.  All right.  Thanks, [unintelligible] nice to meet you.
