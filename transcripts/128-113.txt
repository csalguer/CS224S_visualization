0:01 0:03 MALE:  Oh no, that's not what I want. 
0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  I [unintelligible].  
0:05 0:18 MALE:  I know.  I can't hack it.  I'm gonna crack.  It's always at the end.  Like I start putting random numbers down at the end.  
0:04 0:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, I totally feel like, yeah, after those last four questions I don't even know what the questions are. Hey, I'm female128. 
0:31 0:33 MALE:  Hi, [unintelligible].  Good to meet you. 
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you. 
0:34 0:35 MALE:  Which department are you in?
0:20 0:21 FEMALE:  Geophysics, what about you?
0:36 0:38 MALE:  Whoah, electrical engineering.  
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:39 0:50 MALE:  I met somebody else in geophysics, and she was like trying to describe the difference between that and like geology to me because to me it was all the same.  But she [unintelligible] we actually do math or something like that.  
0:35 0:36 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:52 0:54 MALE:  I can't remember her name, but--
0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  [interposing]  What did she look like?
0:56 1:05 MALE:  Uh, it's kind of dark so it's kind of hard to say.  Maybe sandy blonde, I don't know.  I think she was a first year.  
0:51 0:51 FEMALE:  Whitney?
1:08 1:10 MALE:  Nah, it doesn't ring a bell.  
0:55 0:57 FEMALE:  Okay.  There's only one here.
1:12 1:12 MALE:  Okay.
0:56 0:58 FEMALE:  There's only one first year who has blonde hair. 
1:13 1:15 MALE:  Okay, okay, maybe she had brown hair.
1:04 1:11 FEMALE:  I think you met the only one first year, because we're not [unintelligible]. 
1:26 1:30 MALE:  Okay.  Oh, really?  I thought she was a first year, but okay.
1:16 1:20 FEMALE:  Anyway.  What kind of stuff do you do in electrical engineering?
1:35 1:44 MALE:  I'm a PhD student.  I do like optic lasers.  My professor, his interests, are mainly in like making scientific instruments. 
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:45 1:48 MALE:  Like making the tools that scientists will use later to perform like experiments.
1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:49 1:54 MALE:  So, like for example, like we did a laser that will be used in particle accelerators. 
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:55 1:59 MALE:  Stuff like that, uhm.  Yeah, I think it's cool, but--
1:44 1:51 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah, I had a friend of mine [unintelligible] worked for a company in Canada called [unintelligible] Technologies.
2:06 2:06 MALE:  Okay. 
1:52 1:54 FEMALE:  Where they build particle accelerators. 
2:09 2:10 MALE:  Oh yeah, all right.  
1:55 1:56 FEMALE:  For hospitals and stuff.  
2:11 2:14 MALE:  Okay.  Oh yeah, for radiation therapy, or? 
1:59 2:00 FEMALE:  I think so. 
2:15 2:15 MALE:  Okay, yeah.  
2:01 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, he came down here.  I can't wait [unintelligible] accelerator.  
2:21 2:21 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  Had the pre-req.  
2:23 2:23 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:08 2:12 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
2:28 2:30 MALE:  Wow, so what do you want to do later on? 
2:15 2:16 FEMALE:  I haven't decided yet.  
2:32 2:32 MALE:  Okay.  
2:18 2:28 FEMALE:  No, no, no, depending on the week sometimes I want to be a professor.  Sometimes I want to go into policy.  Sometimes I want to, I don't know, drop out of school and become a mom.  I don't know.  
2:43 2:44 MALE:  Oh, really?  
2:30 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, it changes every day.  How about you?  
2:48 2:49 MALE:  I think I want to work in industry for a while. 
2:34 2:35 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
2:50 2:52 MALE:  And see what it's like.  I've been at a university for so long.  
2:36 2:37 FEMALE:  Yeah, will you do the same stuff you've been?
2:53 3:06 MALE:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I definitely--I think that's what I'm meant to do almost.  It's like because ever since I was little I've been interested in like science and technology.  I've just kind of--my life has just kind of gone like a straight edge narrow one thing leading into another.  
2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Did you [unintelligible]?  
3:09 3:14 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  [unintelligible] engineering undergrad there. 
3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  Where?
3:15 3:16 MALE:  I went to Princeton.  
3:01 3:01 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
3:17 3:20 MALE:  The cold, cold East Coast. 
3:05 3:06 FEMALE:  Yeah, I've never been.  
3:22 3:23 MALE:  You've never been to the East Coast?
3:09 3:09 FEMALE:  No. 
3:24 3:25 MALE:  Oh, wow.  Are you from California?  
3:11 3:12 FEMALE:  No, I'm from Canada.  
3:28 3:33 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Oh, nice.  Did you go to school there too?  
3:19 3:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, I went to UBC. 
3:34 3:38 MALE:  UBC, okay.  Wow, so that's like a huge engineering school, right?  
3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  Yep, [unintelligible] took engineering.  
3:40 3:40 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
3:26 3:29 FEMALE:  It's a pretty--it's a big school.  But it's a big school for a lot of things.  
3:44 3:44 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:30 3:31 FEMALE:  But engineering happens to be--
3:47 3:51 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, wow, Vancouver is so pretty. I went there pretty recently like a couple of months ago.  
3:36 3:37 FEMALE:  What were you doing?  
3:52 4:06 MALE:  I was--a friend works for Microsoft so I visited him in Seattle, and then a bunch of us like we just decided to go up to Vancouver to eat of all things because like the food there is good.  It was awesome and cheap too.  
3:51 3:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's better than anywhere else.  
4:07 4:07 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:53 3:54 FEMALE:  And I can say that. 
4:09 4:15 MALE:  The guys at the border were like, okay, what are you coming in for?  We were like, uh, to eat lunch.  And then he's like, you guys drive so many hours just to eat? 
4:01 4:02 FEMALE:  Where did you go? 
4:17 4:20 MALE:  This all you can eat sushi place, and it was cheap.  It was like 12 Canadian. 
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Do you know where it was?
4:21 4:22 MALE:  Oh, I can't remember where it was. 
4:07 4:08 FEMALE:  Like was it [unintelligible] and Broadbent?  
4:23 4:26 MALE:  I don't remember any of the streets, but it was awesome.  It was awesome.  
4:12 4:14 FEMALE:  [laughter]
