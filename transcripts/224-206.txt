1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So what are you studying? 
1:36 1:36 MALE:  I'm computer science.  
1:37 1:38 FEMALE:  You're the first one I've met. 
1:39 1:41 MALE:  You're the second consecutive person who's told me that. 
1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  What? 
1:42 1:43 MALE:  You're the second consecutive person who's told me that.  
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  [laughter] That's because everyone we've met is like electrical engineering.  
1:48 1:49 MALE:  Engineering, engineering, yeah.     
1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  But not just engineering, electrical engineering. 
1:53 1:53 MALE:  Crazy.

2:05 2:11 MALE:  --the girls I meet I have to like, you know,  I may be the only computer science that they're ever going to meet tonight and like and the future of all computer science-- 
2:12 2:15 FEMALE:  [laughter] You're the one we're like pinning everything too. 
2:16 2:17 MALE:  I know.  I feel like just a huge amount of pressure. 
2:18 2:23 FEMALE:  So how do you feel about Microsoft?  That's the case that, I'm working on a presentation about Microsoft right now.  
2:24 2:25 MALE:  Um, well I actually worked there last summer. 
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Really? 
2:27 2:27 MALE: Mm-hmm.

2:41 2:46 MALE:  They, I just don't know that they're going to, I think they're going, I think Google is going to compete-- 
2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  Really?  
2:47 2:51 MALE:  --with them eventually. Um, that's my, that's my belief.   
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  So you say buy stock in Google? 
2:53 2:53 MALE:  If you can afford it, yeah. 
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  [laughter] Its' only $2:00 a pop.  
2:55 2:56 MALE:  [laughter] 
2:57 2:57 FEMALE:  It's ridiculous.  
2:58 3:03 MALE:  [laughter] Well I guess its cheaper then it was last year.  But um--
3:04 3:06 FEMALE:  Half cheaper.  It's 1:00%.

3:10 3:10 FEMALE:  Yeah, I regret that.  [laughter] 
3:11 3:43 MALE:  I don't know, but no, like, they were really nice there, like they were really great to work for.  They were, like, they treated me pretty well, but like at the same time, they were, every now and then, they, like every week we have like a talk we go to, you know, a Tech Talk they call them. Most of them are like propaganda, you know, and like, there was like one in particular where the guy was like, he's talking like X-box and how they were, you know, trying to take over the market you know.  And it was just, it was so obvious his attitude, you know, it's like a vulture.  We saw this as an opportunity that we can go in and grab the market from them.  
3:44 3:44 FEMALE:  Well I heard that they're sort of like--
3:45 3:46 MALE:  That's [unintelligible], that's what they need to do. 
3:47 3:49 FEMALE:  --in they encloakate [phonetic] paranoia.  Like--
3:50 3:50 MALE:  Like, oh no, we're losing out. 
3:51 3:53 FEMALE:  You've got to watch your back or like what's the next new standard, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
