1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
2:04 2:07 MALE:  This [unintelligible] like this guy--I feel like I'm a little bit awkward in this thing.  
2:04 2:07 FEMALE:  It's kind of like [unintelligible].

2:40 2:48 MALE:  Yeah, I feel like there are a lot of people who I have known who are around this campus.  It's hard to like find out where people are.  
2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, where did you do your undergrad?  
2:50 2:51 MALE:  Washington and Saint Louis.  
2:48 2:52 FEMALE:  Are there many people from there out here?

So, they're right now starting the MBA program.  But I wouldn't say that I--probably like five people.  I mean there are tons of people in the Bay area too. 
3:07 3:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:19 3:22 MALE:  Oh cool.  That's awesome.  That will be fun.  
3:18 3:19 FEMALE:  So it will be a big political issue.
