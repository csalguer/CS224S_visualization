0:03:13.3 0:03:14.3 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:03:13.8 0:03:15.6 FEMALE:  -I think un- until a couple of years ago--

0:03:24.3 0:03:25.4 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:03:25.4 0:03:26.9 FEMALE:  Well because the [unintelligible] 
0:03:26.7 0:03:29.1 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:03:28.3 0:03:33.3 FEMALE:  [laughter] well the reason I would actually know this is I lived-- I studied abroad when I was in college. 
0:03:33.0 0:03:33.8 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:33.1 0:03:34.5 FEMALE:  I lived in Scotland-
0:03:34.1 0:03:34.6 MALE:  Right.
0:03:34.3 0:03:38.1 FEMALE:  -and, um, watching World Cup and the European- 
0:03:37.7 0:03:38.8 MALE:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 
0:03:37.9 0:03:41.4 FEMALE:  -championship soccer is it was known as Yugoslavia.
0:03:41.1 0:03:41.6 MALE:  Right.
0:03:41.1 0:03:43.9 FEMALE:  And I was like, but I didn't think Yugoslavia existed anymore-
0:03:43.5 0:03:44.0 MALE:  Right.
0:03:43.6 0:03:50.4 FEMALE:  -because in school you studied about how it broke up so you didn't realize that part of it still retained the identity of the country.
0:03:50.4 0:03:51.4 MALE:  Right. Right.
0:03:51.0 0:03:53.9 FEMALE:  And so I-- I learned that by living abroad.
0:03:53.6 0:03:54.7 MALE:  Oh yeah [unintelligible] 
0:03:54.2 0:03:55.5 FEMALE:  So.  Okay.

0:04:02.0 0:04:09.4 FEMALE:  You know I don't-- I don't have a particularly favorite team.  I actually just enjoy watching it.  I actually very much enjoy watching the Netherlands play.
0:04:08.5 0:04:09.1 [horn]
0:04:09.2 0:04:10.6 MALE:  Oh yeah?  [laughter]  
0:04:09.9 0:04:16.8 FEMALE:  Anyway.  Yeah.  But anyway-- [laughter] they're- they're very-- I think it's because they're very technically good-
0:04:16.5 0:04:16.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:04:16.8 0:04:20.1 FEMALE:  -but the-- the Germans are also very technically solid, but they're-
0:04:19.6 0:04:20.0 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:04:20.2 0:04:21.2 FEMALE:  -boring to watch.
0:04:20.9 0:04:21.9 MALE:  Yeah, they're- 
0:04:21.1 0:04:24.3 FEMALE:  And the Netherlands have a little bit more flair, so anyway.
0:04:23.3 0:04:25.4 MALE:  Oh yeah.  Uh, no, I totally agree. 
0:04:24.2 0:04:26.7 FEMALE:  [laughter] Anyway it was--
0:04:26.1 0:04:27.4 MALE:  [unintelligible]
