0:00 0:01 FEMALE: Well, that's fast.

[Background Noise]

0:00 0:05 MALE: Ooh. I really wasn't ready for that.

0:02 0:05 FEMALE: Okay.  Will you award [phonetic] me ten more seconds?

0:09 0:10 MALE: Ten more seconds?

0:06 0:07 FEMALE: Well, five more seconds.

0:11 0:12 MALE: All right, I'll try to occupy myself somehow.

0:09 0:10 FEMALE: So how's it going?

0:14 0:15 MALE: It's going pretty well.  I'm male218.

0:11 0:12 FEMALE: male218, I'm female222.

0:16 0:17 MALE: female222, how's it going?

0:13 0:20 FEMALE: Hi.  Sorry, oh my gosh, okay.  Sure they're all the same.

0:24 0:25 MALE: All [unintelligible]?  All the same?

0:22 0:25 FEMALE: [laughter]. No, I'm just kind of -- I'm still trying to -

0:28 0:33 MALE: Just anything -- circling absolutely anything?  It's like taking the SAT or something with like ten seconds left.

0:30 0:32 FEMALE: Yeah.  Okay, cool.  So how's it going, male218?

0:36 0:37 MALE: It's going pretty well, how are you doing?

0:33 0:34 FEMALE: Good.  Um...

0:39 0:43 MALE: Um... so what is it -- what is it that you're up to here, at Stanford University?

0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Here, I'm in the School of Education.

0:44 0:45 MALE: The School of Education?

0:41 0:41 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:45 0:46 MALE: Oh, cool.

0:42 0:45 FEMALE: So, I'm with [unintelligible] right there, but uh, yeah.

0:48 0:51 MALE: Oh, interesting.  Anything in particular that you want to educate, or...?

0:47 0:49 FEMALE: That I want to educate?

0:53 0:55 MALE: I guess, yeah.  Anyone you want to educate?  Like any particular sector?

0:51 0:57 FEMALE: Um... children.  But I'm into research and administration, and stuff like that.  

1:00 1:02 MALE: So sort of like general education.

0:59 1:02 FEMALE: I guess so.  Education research, maybe.

1:05 1:05 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

1:02 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:07 1:07 MALE: What kind of research?

1:06 1:08 FEMALE: Um, social -- I'm in the Social Science Program.

1:12 1:13 MALE: Mm-hmm, okay.

1:10 1:13 FEMALE: So I should do like final [phonetic] work.

1:16 1:17 MALE: Mm-hmm.

1:13 1:14 FEMALE: That kind of stuff.

1:18 1:31 MALE: Educational research is always so interesting, right, 'cause like they go and you try to get a transcript of like a class talking, and when you're sitting there like listening to a class, like it seems to all make sense, and when you get it down on paper, like what people are actually saying, and it's almost incomprehensible.

1:28 1:28 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

1:33 1:34 MALE: It's like I teach Russian, and I was teaching English.

1:32 1:32 FEMALE: Oh, okay.

1:37 1:39 MALE: So I've gone through several sort of like teacher-training programs.

1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Oh, okay, okay.

1:40 1:43 MALE: And it's always so funny, like, when they give you those transcripts of an actual class.

1:39 1:39 FEMALE: Oh.

1:44 1:49 MALE: I always wonder how people can ever do research with education, 'cause it just seems like so difficult to actually figure out -

1:45 1:45 FEMALE: Yeah.

1:50 1:50 MALE: - what was happening.

1:47 1:48 FEMALE: Yeah, definitely.

1:51 1:53 MALE: Unless you're actually there, or if you are recording it.

1:48 1:55 FEMALE: Well, I think a lot -- well, I think for me, I feel like it helps a lot to be in the place, and to be where everything is -- where it's happening.

2:00 2:00 MALE: Mm-hmm.

1:56 2:01 FEMALE: I mean it's different when you're actually experiencing by yourself first-hand and not just reading something from a book or something.

2:05 2:05 MALE: Yeah.

2:02 2:07 FEMALE: So I mean I think anything first-hand is always like the best -

2:11 2:11 MALE: Probably.

2:08 2:09 FEMALE: - education that you can get, right?

2:12 2:20 MALE: I think that's a good one, that is a good one.  I'll have to remember that.  Um, what um - so are you interested in like younger kids?  Like high school kids?

2:16 2:20 FEMALE: Well, I like the younger ones, but I think in general I'm just interested in -

2:24 2:27 MALE: Or like running more -- something like administration or even like curriculum development?

2:23 2:24 FEMALE: Yeah, in like K to 12.

2:28 2:28 MALE: Mm-hmm.

2:25 2:26 FEMALE: Yeah, so.

2:30 2:32 MALE: My Mom does 3rd grade, which she seems to really like.

2:28 2:29 FEMALE: Oh, really?  That's cool.

2:33 2:36 MALE: Yeah.  Yeah, she started with 6th grade, and they moved her to 5th, and then 4th, and then 3rd.

2:33 2:33 FEMALE: Okay.

2:37 2:38 MALE: So she's been like slowly demoted.

2:35 2:35 FEMALE: Oh.  

2:40 2:41 MALE: Well, it's our joke, but I mean it's obviously not a demotion, but...

2:38 2:40 FEMALE: No, it's harder when they're younger, though.

2:41 2:45 MALE: Every grade is important.  It is.  I was teaching -- I was teaching English in Moscow.

2:42 2:42 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

2:46 2:48 MALE: And I had to teach these like 6-year olds English.

2:44 2:44 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.  

2:48 2:53 MALE: And it was like one of the biggest disasters I've ever had.  Like the kids were just like -- it was like impossible to -

2:49 2:49 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

2:53 2:59 MALE: - to get them to just do anything.  And they had just been -- they'd been to like a full day of Russian school, and then they were brought to this school -

2:55 2:55 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

3:00 3:07 MALE: - by their grandmothers.  So like an hour and ten minutes of listening to me speak to them in English.  Like, they were just switched off before I even started, like...

3:03 3:05 FEMALE: [laughter].  Did you like that, or...?

3:09 3:16 MALE: I liked it, I liked it, um... I guess I would have preferred maybe in sort of a different setting.  Like - I guess I like working with more like university kids. 

3:13 3:15 FEMALE: Oh, okay.  So like the older ones.

3:16 3:20 MALE: Like once they get a little bit older.  When they get -- when they're more stable [phonetic].

3:16 3:17 FEMALE: You like to challenge their mind.  

3:20 3:25 MALE: Yeah.  Well, no also I used to swim coach, and I would have these like tiny little kids -

3:21 3:21 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

3:25 3:28 MALE: - and I'd work an entire summer with them, you know they were four and five years old.

3:23 3:24 FEMALE: But they're so cute! 

3:28 3:35 MALE: Right, and then the next summer they'd come back to the pool, and I'd be like, "Oh, hey nameX."  And nameX would stare at me.  No recognition whatsoever.

3:30 3:31 FEMALE: I know. [laughter].

3:35 3:48 MALE: No recog -- and they'd be like, "nameX, this is male218.  He was your swim coach, like all last summer."  And nameX would just sort of stare at me blankly, and at that point I was like -- I wasn't even sure if it was worth it to work with five -- you put an entire summer into working with them -

3:44 3:44 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

3:48 3:49 MALE: - and they don't even remember you.

3:46 3:46 FEMALE: [laughter].

3:51 3:52 MALE: So, I don't know.

3:48 3:48 FEMALE: Aww...

3:52 3:58 MALE: No, but it's -- it's fun.  But I mean actually, actually it's more of a joke, but it was fun working with younger kids.

3:54 3:55 FEMALE: Yeah... yeah, right.

3:59 4:02 MALE: And even in Moscow, I had one class that was excellent, and one class was awful.

4:01 4:01 [Background Noise]

3:59 3:59 FEMALE: Uh-huh.

4:04 4:05 MALE: Well, female222 - yeah that was really fast. You've got a buzzer request [phonetic].  Very nice to meet you.

4:02 4:02 FEMALE: [laughter]  Nice to meet you. 

4:06 4:07 MALE: Have a good rest of the night.

4:03 4:03 FEMALE: You, too.

4:08 4:09 MALE: Your seat's B?  Is this B?

4:05 4:05 FEMALE: I'm on B.

4:09 4:09 MALE: Okay.

4:07 4:07 FEMALE: Yes, I'm the B.  [laughter].
