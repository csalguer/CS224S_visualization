1:03 1:03 MALE: I wouldn't--
1:12 1:12 FEMALE: It's very fun.
1:04 1:04 MALE: I wouldn't say well.
1:13 1:13 FEMALE: [laughter]
1:05 1:15 MALE: But, you know.  I actually grew up, a couple of my friends growing up were Latin, of various latin descent, and so they used to take me to these like salsa clubs, and I was like the token white boy.  Salsa clubs.
1:23 1:27 FEMALE: [laughter]  That's good, it means I'm sure you're, I'm sure you learned.
1:16 1:22 MALE: You kind of learn when you're thrown in there, you know, about average for a white guy, which doesn't say that much.  
1:32 1:34 FEMALE: And you know, not necessarily, but--
1:25 1:30 MALE: Oh, for- for a non-experienced one.  I'm an amateur.
1:38 1:54 FEMALE: I'm sure you're quite good.  I'm sure you're quite good.  But, yeah, that would be like a big hobby.  And then other things, just like, let's see, you know, just the standard, you know, reading, going to, you know, theater, going to city, I like dancing in general, clubbing.  
1:45 1:46 MALE: That's cool.
1:55 2:03 FEMALE: You know, it's-- you know.  I won't say standard, but like nothing outstanding, really strange about it, travel, you know, whatnot.  So.  How about yourself?
1:55 1:57 MALE: Uh, my hobbies?  
2:06 2:06 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:59 2:00 MALE: Uh, running, biking and swimming.  
2:10 2:13 FEMALE: Okay.  Try out a triathlon, then?  [laughter]
2:05 2:07 MALE: I try, yeah.  [unintelligible]  Um, that's probably my biggest--
2:17 2:17 FEMALE: Okay.
2:09 2:10 MALE: --time-consuming hobby.
2:19 2:19 FEMALE: That's cool.  
2:11 2:16 MALE: Uh, I'm trying to learn to play a guitar for like five years, but very, very slowly.  
2:24 2:25 FEMALE: [laughter]
2:18 2:20 MALE: Uh, I like trying new things, so I've like--
2:27 2:29 FEMALE: I'm sure you're much better about it-- yeah.
2:20 2:26 MALE: --tried sailing, I've- I went to that river guide school to be white water rafting guy. 
2:35 2:35 FEMALE: That's cool.
2:26 2:27 MALE: Like I've tried all these different things, but--
2:37 2:38 FEMALE: So very physically active, it sounds like.
2:29 2:30 MALE: Very physically active.
2:39 2:40 FEMALE: Okay.  That's very cool.
2:31 2:37 MALE: Uh, and very, a little bit scattered, so like I'll try sailing, and then I'll like, like that was cool, and I'll do something else now.  
2:46 2:46 FEMALE: Right.
2:37 2:39 MALE: And then I'll never learn how to sail because I didn't stick with it.
2:48 2:49 FEMALE: Right, you didn't stick with it long enough.
2:40 2:43 MALE: Still kind of, I think figuring out, like what are the things I want to focus on.  
2:52 2:52 FEMALE: Right.
2:44 2:44 MALE: But triathlon has stuck.  
2:54 2:54 FEMALE: Alright.
2:45 2:49 MALE: I tried that a couple years ago, and-- like I liked how disciplined [unintelligible] to get in shape, so--
2:57 3:02 FEMALE: Oh, that's awesome.  So you used to do each individual discipline, or separately, and they just kind of came together, or-- ?
2:53 2:55 MALE: No, I used to do none of them, and then I just started doing all of them.  Basically.  
3:06 3:06 FEMALE: Wow.
2:57 2:59 MALE: I was like a banker in New York--
3:08 3:08 FEMALE: Okay.
2:59 3:02 MALE: --and gained like 15 pounds, what that entails--
3:10 3:10 FEMALE: Okay.
3:02 3:02 MALE: And uh--
3:12 3:12 FEMALE: Right.
3:03 3:08 MALE: So I ended up moving out to California, I like, alright, time to get fit and get active.  
3:17 3:20 FEMALE: It's pretty much impossible not to do it here, because everyone seems to be playing a sport.  
3:11 3:12 MALE: It's so infectious.
3:20 3:31 FEMALE: I mean, like you know, it's sort of like, unless you play sports, almost like, what are you doing here, might as well be studying these sports, so.  So, I have to admit to not playing any sports, so it's like, I don't really fit in, but you know.  It's okay.
3:22 3:22 MALE: But you still enjoy the sunshine, hopefully.
3:32 3:37 FEMALE: I do. I do.  Very much so.  So, are you, what program are you in?
3:25 3:29 MALE: Definitely nice.  I'm an MBA.
3:38 3:44 FEMALE: Okay.  You're about, I think, third or fourth person in the program that I've met so far.  The contingent is pretty strong.
3:33 3:39 MALE: Yeah, there's- there is like six MBA men here, which might be telling.
3:47 3:50 FEMALE: And at least one MBA woman that I was talking to, so-- 
3:40 3:42 MALE: Is- who's that?  Oh, nameX, yeah.
3:52 3:59 FEMALE: nameX, yeah.  So, obviously it's cool, I was just like, I think this is more business school people than I've met like probably in like, tonight, in the last two years.
[horn]
3:51 3:51 MALE: I wonder what the combination--
4:01 4:02 FEMALE: Wow, that's good.
3:52 3:53 MALE: Oh, can't tell you my theory.
4:03 4:03 FEMALE: Darn.  
3:55 3:59 MALE: [unintelligible] is like generally pretty outgoing, so they're willing to do something like this.  
4:07 4:11 FEMALE: Right.  Willing to do four minutes, present yourself in four minutes.
4:00 4:02 MALE: And there's a lot of single guys I guess.
4:11 4:12 FEMALE: [laughter].  Cool.
4:04 4:04 MALE: Nice meeting you.
4:14 4:15 FEMALE: Well, nice meeting you, too.
4:07 4:07 MALE: So.
