0:08 0:10 MALE: I'm not asking the right questions, clearly.

0:04 0:06 FEMALE: [laughter] Now that you know what you're supposed to rate people on.

0:12 0:13 MALE: Yeah I know.

0:06 0:08 FEMALE: You can identify what your questions should be.

0:14 0:17 MALE: I have not seen any questions to distil anything about ambitious yet.

0:12 0:16 FEMALE: Don't ask me what I want to do with my life, 'cause I'm not sure that I have an answer for that.  [horn] 

0:22 0:24 MALE: I don't think many people do.  Well.

0:17 0:18 FEMALE: I'm female231.

0:25 0:26 MALE: I'm male208.

0:18 0:19 FEMALE: It's a pleasure to meet you.

0:26 0:35 MALE: Very nice to meet you.  So where should we start.  Um, tell me, I don't know, tell me something that you're really passionate about.

0:28 0:36 FEMALE: Something I'm really passionate about.  Wow that's a good question.  Um right now I'm passionate about getting through my first year of my PhD program.

0:43 0:44 MALE: Uh-huh.  

0:37 0:45 FEMALE: And doing so successfully.  That's sort of a boring answer.  Um I'm a first year here and it's been sort of a rough year, so I'm trying to get through that.

0:52 0:54 MALE: But then you've got the time to come to something like this.

0:47 0:54 FEMALE: Yeah.  Well, my roommate is friends with the girl that's running it, and we're taking other classes, so, whatever.  It's kind of fun.  So.  What about you?

1:02 1:06 MALE: What am I passionate about?  Um, probably the biggest thing, coming from Australia--

0:59 1:00 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  

1:07 1:09 MALE: Um I've done a lot of traveling, so traveling.

1:02 1:03 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:09 1:17 MALE: And just kind of absorbing other cultures and meeting different people is definitely something I really enjoy doing, so--

1:10 1:12 FEMALE: Are you in class here, are you a student, or--?

1:19 1:21 MALE: I'm in class at the business school.

1:14 1:15 FEMALE: Oh okay.

1:21 1:22 MALE: Yeah.  

1:15 1:16 FEMALE: First year, second year?

1:23 1:24 MALE: Second year.

1:17 1:18 FEMALE: So what are you going to do next year?

1:25 1:27 MALE: I'm moving to San Francisco for a while.

1:19 1:20 FEMALE: Excellent.

1:28 1:30 MALE: Um, and doing some consulting.

1:23 1:24 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:31 1:32 MALE: And then after that I'm not sure.

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:32 1:35 MALE: Maybe start a company once I figure out what I want to do.

1:28 1:30 FEMALE: Where will you start your company?

1:37 1:38 MALE: Here.

1:30 1:33 FEMALE: Not in San Francisco, right?  You'll go somewhere else, yeah?

1:38 1:40 MALE: Well I think here somewhere.

1:33 1:34 FEMALE: Yeah?

1:40 1:41 MALE: Yeah.  This is the best place to work.  

1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Yeah.  

1:42 1:49 MALE: San Francisco is, like, of all the cities in the world, outside of Australia, I think it's probably one of the few ones that I think I could live in.

1:42 1:43 FEMALE: It's--

1:49 1:50 MALE: I really enjoy it.

1:43 2:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  I've got some friends--I just moved to, you know, the area about six months ago, um, but I have some friends who've been living in San Francisco for about ten years, so I've been out sort of spending weekends with them, and they've been showing me the city, and it's just astounding.  People are friendly, it's beautiful, like all the neighborhoods have these really distinct personalities, so.

2:08 2:09 MALE: Where did you move from?

2:02 2:04 FEMALE: I moved from DC, but I grew up in Texas.

2:12 2:14 MALE: Do you know the [unintelligible] Pub?

2:07 2:09 FEMALE: I do.  Have you been there?

2:15 2:16 MALE: That is one of my favorite pubs.

2:09 2:11 FEMALE: Absolutely.  I mean they have like a thousand beers.  How can you not love it?

2:19 2:25 MALE: Yeah.  The first time I went there I swore that I would drink through every single beer there, but I think I'm only--I've only had probably 20 or 30.

2:18 2:22 FEMALE: I think they give you a patch or something, don't they?  If you drink through all the beers that they have?

2:29 2:30 MALE: I have no idea.

2:23 2:35 FEMALE: The first time I went there the friends I went with said write down what you want, and write down, like, your second and third choice in case they can't find the first one.  And then they go away for like 15 minutes, 'cause they're hunting for the beer, right?  But yeah.

2:42 2:51 MALE: I just remember getting reasonably drunk and then there was a bunch of tourists there and I remember speaking to them in a Scottish accent and thinking, thinking at the time I was very good at it.

2:44 2:45 FEMALE: Uh-huh.  

2:52 2:54 MALE: But I know that I cannot do a Scottish accent if I'm not drunk, so--

2:47 2:49 FEMALE: Yeah but if they're Americans they may not be able to tell the difference [unintelligible].

2:56 2:57 MALE: That's probably true [laughter].

2:51 2:53 FEMALE: So are you--what were you doing in DC?

3:01 3:02 MALE: Just traveling.

2:55 2:56 FEMALE: Okay.  Cool.

3:03 3:06 MALE: Yeah.  But I have a few friends there now, so--

2:59 3:00 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:07 3:11 MALE: I go back and visit them.  In DC and in New York every once in a while.

3:04 3:06 FEMALE: Yeah.  Do you have a favorite pub in New York then?

3:18 3:19 MALE: Not really.

3:12 3:13 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:20 3:26 MALE: I just get wheeled to--the problem with New York is the best bars change almost on a weekly basis.

3:19 3:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  

3:26 3:27 MALE: Where in DC they're kind of more--

3:20 3:21 FEMALE: They stay put.

3:28 3:29 MALE: Like the, the--

3:21 3:22 FEMALE: Right.  

3:29 3:31  MALE: If you asked 80 percent of the people will know the [unintelligible] pub.

3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Absolutely.

3:32 3:33 MALE: Yeah.

3:25 3:33 FEMALE: Yeah.  That's definitely a bit of an institution.  There are some of the ones down, like in Georgetown on M Street in DC.  Those tend to flip over a little bit more quickly.

3:41 3:43 MALE: That's such a popular street though.

3:34 3:36 FEMALE: Probably because the real estate is too high, yeah.

3:43 3:45 MALE: I loved going down there in summer. Yeah.  

3:38 3:45 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm actually going--I lived in DC for three years.  I'm actually going back this summer to do an internship for a couple months, so I'm sort of excited about it.

3:52 3:54 MALE: How long are you going to be out here for?

3:47 3:50 FEMALE: I'll be here for another at least three, probably four years.

3:57 3:59 MALE: Wow.  How are you going to survive out in the suburbs?  

3:52 4:10 FEMALE: How am I going to survive?  Um well, probably in a year I'll move up to San Francisco, 'cause in a year I'll be done with course work, and then I'll be spending most of my time doing research and writing, and so I figure I can do that remotely a little bit more easily.  Um, I actually kind of like Palo Alto, I just sort of miss having stuff that's open later than 10 o'clock at night.

4:17 4:18 MALE: Yeah.  

4:10 4:13 FEMALE: You know?  So.

4:19 4:20 MALE: A lot of guys.

4:13 4:14 FEMALE: Sorry?

4:21 4:23 MALE: There's a lot of guys around here.  [horn] 

4:15 4:16 FEMALE: Here in Palo Alto?

4:23 4:24 MALE: Yeah.  

4:17 4:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  Lot of engineers.  [laughter] That's it.  Nice meeting you.

4:29 4:31 MALE: There's a lot of engineers here too. 

4:24 4:25 FEMALE: Yes.  But you're not one of those.  Nice meeting you.

4:33 4:34 MALE: Likewise.

4:26 4:27 FEMALE: Absolutely.
