0:48 0:50 FEMALE: Oh, you must like school.
0:50 0:55 MALE:  I guess I do.  I don't know if I don't like school, if I just like school or I don't like work.  It's one of the two, so.
0:55 1:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think it's the don't like work.  Because sometimes I don't like school at all.
1:00 1:00 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible].
1:00 1:03 FEMALE:  But I don't like school less then I -- whatever, don't like work.
1:03 1:14 MALE:  Yeah, that's what I was just gonna say, but yeah, the last girl, why did you get into your field, well, I wouldn't say I like it, but it's the thing I dislike least.  It's a very pessimistic way of looking at it, but.
1:14 1:18 FEMALE:  Well, hopefully you'll find -- so would you be a professor afterwards or?
1:18 1:23 MALE:  [unintelligible] the field I'm in is very oil inspiration related so probably work for an oil company, so.
1:23 1:24 FEMALE:  Interesting.
1:25 1:29 MALE:  It's very politically correct and of course people are you know, very happy about that, so.
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh.
1:30 1:32 MALE:  [unintelligible] work on renewable energy?  Well, okay.

1:43 1:43 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:43 1:49 MALE:  Yeah, it's -- I'm curious to see how that -- I heard it's very beaurocratic and large company [unintelligible].
1:50 1:53 FEMALE:  Very cons -- my grandfather worked there, so I actually have some interaction.  Very conservative.
1:54 2:05 MALE:  That's what I heard.  I heard it's [unintelligible] 980 work week thing, every second Friday off though, very, yeah, very rigid.
2:05 2:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean you're right, it is the biggest company in the world, so that's gotta be an interesting place to be.
2:15 2:19 MALE:  We'll see what it's like.  What about yourself?  Are you gonna stay in the area afterwards or?
2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  I don't know.
2:20 2:21 MALE:  What -- what field are you in?

2:40 2:42 MALE:  I'm sure you guys would love that [unintelligible] too.
2:42 2:48 FEMALE:  Well, I mean, I feel like I can't really say anything because I have so much family history with that [unintelligible].
