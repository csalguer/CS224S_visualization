0:30 0:31 FEMALE: Really?  Why not?
0:17 0:29 MALE: Well, it's like--well, this is like a--it's--this place is just so fun, as far as--especially the business school, like, that I don't want to leave.  And [unintelligible] give us.  It's like--you know, it's a lot of work, but it's also, like--you know, it's been a great two years. 
0:45 0:46 FEMALE: You met a lot of people, and--
0:31 0:41 MALE: Yeah, and I love [unintelligible] around the world.  My closest friends are literally going everywhere, all around the world.  And so I'm kind of like, "I don't want to leave them."  Like, let's all stay. 
0:56 0:56 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:42 0:43 MALE: Yeah.  How about you?  What are you doing?
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: I'm in Immunology. 
0:45 0:45 MALE: Immunology?  Okay. 
1:00 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah, over at the medical school, in a PhD program. 
0:47 0:47 MALE: Medical school, yeah.  Nice.
1:04 1:05 FEMALE: So--
0:49 0:50 MALE: Nice. What year are you in there?
1:06 1:08 FEMALE: I'm a first year, actually. 
0:52 0:53 MALE: A first-year, okay.
1:08 1:10 FEMALE: Actually, yeah, I'm just coming up to my qualifying exams this summer. 
0:54 0:57 MALE: Ah, wow.  That's nice. 
1:11 1:14 FEMALE: So I've quite a while with the people I'm [unintelligible]. 
1:00 1:00 MALE: Where do you come from?
1:15 1:16 FEMALE: I'm from Minnesota.
1:02 1:02 MALE: Minnesota?  Okay. 
1:17 1:18 FEMALE: Yeah, over in the Midwest, and then--
1:03 1:05 MALE: What, what part of Minnesota?
1:20 1:20 FEMALE: Minniapolis. 
1:05 1:06 MALE: Minneapolis.  Okay. 
1:21 1:23 FEMALE: Oh, what about you?  Where are you from?
1:07 1:08 MALE: Um, I'm from Nigeria. 
1:23 1:23 FEMALE: Nigeria?  
1:08 1:10 MALE: Yeah.  Born and raised. 
1:24 1:24 FEMALE: That's cool. 
1:10 1:11 MALE: And I came out here for school.
1:26 1:29 FEMALE: What--for MBA or under grad?
1:13 1:18 MALE: Um, no I came under grad to USC, and then I left and then, um, stayed in California.
1:31 1:31 FEMALE: Okay. 
1:19 1:21 MALE: So I've been here, like, ten years now, in the area. 
1:37 1:39 FEMALE: How did you like USC down in LA area?
1:23 1:36 MALE: Oh, it's fun.  It's fun.  It's a different kind of fun.  Um, I think, like, LA is--people are a little more presumptuous over there and stuff.  But USC is, like--in terms of school spirit, is as good as it comes. Any school--
1:50 1:52 FEMALE: They've got a great football team, don't they?
1:36 1:41 MALE: I mean, yeah.  And the football team, basketball, is just, like, so great.  Like, you go-- 
1:57 1:58 FEMALE: Yeah. 
1:41 1:46 MALE: I go to football games here, and I'm like, "What is this?"  Like, this is no school spirit.  
2:01 2:04 FEMALE: What about the basketball?  Have you been to basketball games?
1:48 1:52 MALE: I've been to basketball games here.  That's--it gets close there, you know?  But, um-- 
2:07 2:09 FEMALE: Well, maybe it's measured by how, how good the team is. 
1:55 2:08 MALE: I don't think so, though 'cause, like, even times when the football team was good, it still--I'm sure they're pretty surprised because, like, for the--for the number of good sports and--that Stanford has, the school spirit's not par to the number of, like--
2:22 2:24 FEMALE: So you think people are too focused on their academics, or--
2:10 2:12 MALE: People are pretty focused on their academics.  I think especially under grads.  
2:27 2:28 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:13 2:18 MALE: I think more so than I would be if I were an under grad here because of how nice the campus is.
2:33 2:34 FEMALE: It is [unintelligible]--
2:18 2:27 MALE: And, like, if I was an under grad here, I'd get no work done.  Like, nothing.  You know, like, I'd just be out, enjoying the--enjoying the sunshine, playing golf.
2:42 2:46 FEMALE: I don't think they appreciate it.  I mean, seriously, it's absolutely stunning. 
2:31 2:33 MALE: Yeah.  I know.  Yeah. 
2:46 2:52 FEMALE: I went to school at Iowa State, and it's just--it, it's nice there, but nothing compared to here. 
2:37 2:38 MALE: No [unintelligible], right?  Yeah. 
2:52 2:59 FEMALE: Like, my parents just visited, and they were like, "Wow."  I was like, "Yeah, can you believe it?  I mean, I go to school here.  It's so nice."
2:44 2:50 MALE: Yeah.  Everyday, you're like--it's like driving down Palm Drive in the morning, I'm like, [unintelligible].    
3:03 3:03 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:51 2:52 MALE: This is nice.  Yeah.
3:05 3:06 FEMALE: This is great.  Yeah, exactly. 
2:52 2:53 MALE: What do you want to do when you get done?
3:09 3:13 FEMALE: Um, well, actually, I'll probably end up going into research for a little while. 
2:58 3:00 MALE: Okay.  How long's the program, by the way, the PhD?
3:15 3:16 FEMALE: The program is about five years. 
3:01 3:01 MALE: Five years?  Okay. 
3:17 3:26 FEMALE: Yeah, and then--and then you've got, like, a three-year research stint you have to do before you can go and move on.  And I'm thinking about maybe consulting, um, that, that sort of thing--
3:11 3:13 MALE: Okay.  Yeah. 
3:26 3:29 FEMALE: Shake things up a little bit, uh, change it.  
3:14 3:15 MALE: Nice. 
3:30 3:32 FEMALE: What about you?  What do you think you'll do?
3:16 3:18 MALE: Um, well, I'm gonna go--I'm going to work in the area. 
3:33 3:34 FEMALE: Um hm. 
3:19 3:25 MALE: And, um, and then longer-term, I want to go back to Africa.  Um, assuming it's up to me, you know, in some ways.    
3:40 3:41 FEMALE: Right. 
3:26 3:35 MALE: Um, and what I'd like to do is start a venture capital fund that helps entrepreneurs start their [unintelligible] their businesses and stuff. 
3:51 3:52 FEMALE: That's neat.  
3:37 3:38 MALE: Yeah, so--
3:52 3:56 FEMALE: So how do you plan on preparing for that while you're over here in the States?
3:40 3:49 MALE: Yeah, so after my first job, I'm planning to, like, then go working for C-fund [phonetic] around here.  And then do that for them [unintelligible].  Yeah.  
4:05 4:05 FEMALE: All right. 
3:50 3:50 MALE: It's really nice meeting you. 
4:06 4:07 FEMALE: Yeah, it was good to meet you. 
3:51 3:53 MALE: Yeah, same here.  Enjoy the rest of the day.
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: Thanks, you too.
