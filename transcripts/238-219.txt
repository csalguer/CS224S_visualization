00:01  00:02	MALE:  Yeah, you're the last one I think. Aren't you?
00:02  00:02	FEMALE:  Are we almost done?
00:03  00:04	MALE:  This should be the last one I think.  
00:04  00:08	FEMALE:  Yeah, that was my first day there [horn] so.  How are you doing?
00:09  00:09	MALE:  I'm male219.
00:10  00:11	FEMALE:  Hi, male219.  I'm female238.
00:12  00:12	MALE:  Hi, how are you?
00:13  00:15	FEMALE:  Okay.  A little overwhelmed with people at this point.
00:16  00:17	MALE:  You'll be done.  I'm it, that's it, no more.
00:18  00:20	FEMALE:  Okay.  I'm kind of an introvert though.  I can't handle talking this much.
00:21  00:22	MALE:  You're not an introvert.  Seriously --
00:23  00:23	FEMALE:  [unintelligible], definitely.
00:24  00:25	MALE:  Are you, what are your four letters?
00:26  00:30	FEMALE:  INFP, introvert, intuitive --
00:31  00:31	MALE:  I mean --
00:32  00:35	FEMALE:  You are?
00:36  00:37	MALE:  P or J, I perceive I don't judge.
00:37  00:38	FEMALE:  Good [unintelligible].
00:38  00:39	MALE:  [laughter] you're INFP and I'm ENFP.
00:40  00:42	FEMALE:  ENFP is kind of a weird combination.
00:43  00:44	MALE:  Extroverted, --
00:45  00:49	FEMALE:  Intuitive, which intuitive versus sensing which is you focus on possibilities or what's there right then.
00:50  00:50	MALE:  Possibilities.
00:51  00:54	FEMALE:  And then thinking versus feelings, do you go with your head or your gut.
00:55  00:55	MALE:  Yeah, I go with feel.
00:56  00:59	FEMALE:  And then perceiving versus judging, how quickly do you come to a decision about things and so.
01:00  01:04	MALE:  So you think ENFP is bad -- is a weird one.
01:05  01:15	FEMALE:  Um, I don't know.  I guess I don't think -- I don't find E and P that often.  I think people that are kind of live more outside their heads come to decisions more quickly.  But, --
01:16  01:21	MALE:  Wow, it seems like you've looked into this quite a bit.  I'm trying myself, I couldn't find whether it was working for me or not.
01:22  01:22	FEMALE:  Yeah.
01:23  01:26	MALE:  But anyways.  So what is this mean, what does --?
01:27  01:30	FEMALE:  It doesn't mean anything.  It means it keeps flipping over.
01:31  01:32	MALE:  Okay.  That's very --
01:33  01:34	FEMALE:  It matches my skirt.
01:34  01:35	MALE:   Okay [laughter].
01:37  01:37	FEMALE:  Yeah, um.
01:38  01:39	MALE:  [laughter] I don't have my own, I couldn't tell you.
01:39  01:40	FEMALE:  What's the P for is it for male219?
01:41  01:47	MALE:  No, it's not actually [laughter].  I try to be clever like that, but no I'm not really that clever.  No.
01:48  01:48	FEMALE:  Is it a school?
01:49  01:50	MALE:  Ah, yeah, it's Penn, I didn't go there though.
01:51  01:51	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
01:52  01:53	MALE:  Where did you go to undergrad?
01:53  01:53	FEMALE:  Georgetown.
01:54  01:55	MALE:  Oh, cool.  Did you like D.C.?
01:55  01:56	FEMALE:  I did.  I loved it.  I'm moving back actually.
01:56  01:57	MALE:  Really, okay.
01:58  01:59	FEMALE:  I'm leaving sunny California to go back to D.C. --
02:00  02:01	MALE:  Is that where you are from?
02:01  02:09	FEMALE:  No, but um, but I couldn't move back to where I'm from because it's Cincinnati and it's just entirely too red state.
02:10  02:10	MALE:  Red state?
02:11  02:13	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, I don't think I could take it.
02:14  02:16	MALE:  So you've been to Cincinnati, D.C. and --
02:17  02:17	FEMALE:  And here.
02:18  02:19	MALE:  And out of them all you like D.C., huh?
02:19  02:21	FEMALE:  I actually like it better here, but I just don't think I can afford to settle down here.
02:23  02:23	MALE:  Right, right.
02:24  02:32	FEMALE:  Like, I'm going to be a teacher and I'm never going to be able to buy a house.  So, unless I marry a millionaire and date a couple of other ones, you know so.  And I'm not -- I don't know how I feel about that.
02:33  02:35	MALE:  [laughter] right, right.  Well you know, you never know, he might come along.
02:36  02:37	FEMALE:  They, they might come along.
02:38  02:45	MALE:  Right, right.  So, what is there to do in D.C. doing this?  I mean I've never stayed in D.C. for a long time.
02:46  02:57	FEMALE:  I really like it.  It's got beautiful architecture.  It's really diverse, um, it's got all the stuff that like New York or Chicago has, but like not nearly as on an intimidating scale as New York for me. 
02:58  02:59	MALE:  Right, right. 
03:00  03:06	FEMALE:  Like I'm from the Midwest, I can't handle New York.  Like I go I have a good time, but I want to go home as soon as I'm done, so.
03:07  03:09	MALE:  Right.  And New York is kind of like, you have to go back to your skyscraper, small little apartment.
03:10  03:16	FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, it's the seat of government, you know.  There are all kinds of great museums and it has a kind of certain majesty to it.
03:17  03:17	MALE:  Right.
03:18  03:19	FEMALE:  You know, it's cool.
03:20  03:20	MALE:  That's true.
03:21  03:21	FEMALE:  So, I like it.
03:22  03:25	MALE:  So then how does Cincinnati compare then to D.C. places, D.C. and here?
03:26  03:39	FEMALE:  Whole different world.  People just get married out of high school and you know, it's a Midwestern town, it's you know.  But it is a good place to raise kids and good place to grow up, you know --
03:40  03:41	MALE:  Not a good place -- not to have fun, no.
03:41  03:43	FEMALE:  Not and have fun, yeah, so yeah.
03:44  03:47	MALE:  What are the crazy thing you like to do now in your youth?
03:48  03:50	FEMALE:  The crazy things.  I don't do crazy things.  No, I'm a very sensible girl.
03:51  03:51	MALE:  Really.
03:52  03:52	FEMALE:  Yes.
03:53  03:54	MALE:  Well, what do you like to do [laughter]?
03:55  03:59	FEMALE:  I do sensible things like darn my socks and invest in mutual funds.
04:01  04:06	MALE:  Right, right, 401K make sure that you know you're getting the right ROFT, roll-over conversions.
04:07  04:07	FEMALE:  Right, sensible things like that.
04:08  04:09	MALE:  Right, right [horn].
04:09  04:12	FEMALE:  But I didn't get to hear anything about you, I'm sorry.  Um, --
04:13  04:13	MALE:  Not a big deal.
04:14  04:15	FEMALE:  Right, well I hope you had a good evening.
04:15  04:16	MALE:  You too, take care.
04:16  04:17	FEMALE:  I think we get to sit here right?  What do we do?  What?
