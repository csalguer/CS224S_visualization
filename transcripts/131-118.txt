0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  I can tell you I'm just whew.
0:03 0:04 MALE:  Oh, man.  
0:00 0:01 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:05 0:06 MALE:  [unintelligible] "L"?
0:01 0:03 FEMALE:  Oh, I wonder if I should get snacks.  
0:08 0:16 MALE:  No, I went and got these snacks for myself.  They were going fast, the teddy grahams are a hot commodity.  So...
0:13 0:14 FEMALE:  I could use a sugar [unintelligible].  
0:17 0:18 MALE:  Oh, you want some?  
0:14 0:16 FEMALE:  Actually, yeah, if you don't mind sharing.  
0:20 0:21 MALE:  No, I don't.  
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  I don't think it has the [unintelligible] like--
0:23 0:27 MALE:  [interposing] No, I hadn't either.  So I had to go get them, right. That was the whole point.  
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  [laughter]  That's plenty.  
0:30 0:30 MALE:  What do you go by?  
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  Alana.  
0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  So, I guess we have to spend our four minutes talking--
0:34 0:38 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, well we could talk about teddy grahams.  No, look.  
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  No one else is going to talk about teddy grahams.  
0:40 0:57 MALE:  Oh, I got these from the person over there.  She's like teddy grahams.  And I'm like, yeah, I haven't had those for so long.  It's like you better go get them because they're going to be gone.  They were.  There was only two left.  It was a key, key play to go get them before they were gone.  
0:54 0:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I can't believe we're only [unintelligible].  
1:00 1:03 MALE:  Why, you think we should be done already?  
0:59 1:01 FEMALE:  I think [unintelligible].  
1:05 1:06 MALE:  It's been going on for too long.  
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  It's tiring.  
1:06 1:10 MALE:  Tiring because--
1:06 1:09 FEMALE:  [interposing]  I mean maybe if I had the teddy grahams before [unintelligible].  
1:14 1:21 MALE: No, eating the teddy grahams will give you a momentary boost, but then they'll just make you more tired probably.  
1:17 1:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, for about [unintelligible].  
1:27 1:35 MALE:  Maybe it's because you guys have just been sitting in the same seat all the time.  That could be a factor because we're getting up, getting the blood pumping.  
1:31 1:33 FEMALE:  Yeah, that could be.  
1:36 1:40 MALE:  I don't know.  Thirteen kind of seems pretty far along for me.  
1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
1:43 2:02 MALE:  Twenty-six?  There's only 20 things, and 20 was the practice.  So, there were only 19.  Yeah, we're like two-thirds of the way done, and the teddy grahams will pump you up for the last six.  So, you're good now.  
1:58 2:00 FEMALE:  There's very little time.  
2:04 2:14 MALE:  I actually subconsciously knew that.  That was part of the reason I went to get them.  These are going to come in handy come date number thirteen.  
2:13 2:14 FEMALE:  That sounds like [unintelligible].  
2:17 2:21 MALE:  You want some more?  I am not really at all.  How about you?
2:18 2:22 FEMALE:  No, but I will have some [unintelligible]. 
2:30 2:32 MALE:  How could you refuse?  Ah.  [Crosstalk]
2:32 2:46 MALE:  Teddy bear down.  Yeah. You'll never forget date number thirteen now.  The teddy graham will always remind you of it.  
2:42 2:49 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
2:54 2:54 MALE:  Finally.  
2:53 2:56 FEMALE:  Visual--visual [unintelligible].  
3:01 3:05 MALE:  In so much as what--like all of this?  Like the whole page?  
3:02 3:05 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I don't know if we can just be like our individuals though because we will--
3:11 3:11 MALE:  [interposing]  Oh.  
3:08 3:08 FEMALE:  I just want to know, don't you.  
3:12 3:13 MALE:  How people rated you?  
3:10 3:11 FEMALE:  I mean not too specifically, but--
3:17 3:20 MALE:  [interposing]  Kind of, but if they were bad, then I wouldn't want to know, right?  
3:16 3:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, but if they really were that bad, wouldn't you want to know?  Think about it.  
3:25 3:45 MALE:  I guess so.  It depends on what ways they were bad.  Ways you thought like you yourself kind of pictured yourself maybe being bad, then they might be like, all right, got to work on that.  But if you really thought you were spot on on one of these and then it came back [unintelligible].  
3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  [laughter]  Yeah, it can be a re-awakening.  
3:48 3:57 MALE:  So, you're expecting to see an average score maybe for all of yous or something?  I don't know.  They could easily give that to you I would think.  
3:54 3:59 FEMALE:  I have learned over time that people who have such different opinions [unintelligible].  
4:03 4:06 MALE:  Yeah, I think it's a lot just based on--
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  [interposing]  [unintelligible].  
4:07 4:08 MALE:  --completely.  
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  And the [unintelligible].  
4:10 4:12 MALE:  Yeah, completely.  
4:08 4:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Well, thank you for the--
4:15 4:18 MALE:  [interposing]  Oh, no problem.  I'm glad that I could offer you them.  
4:15 4:15 FEMALE: Yeah.  
4:22 4:24 MALE:  Yeah, the next guy doesn't have teddy grahams, yeah.  
4:21 4:26 FEMALE:  I would think of you.  [laughter]
