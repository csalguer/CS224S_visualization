0:41 0:43 FEMALE: You forget sometimes that they're out there and then when you remember.

0:47 0:53 MALE: Yeah, well I actually saw my brother in law like a month ago and he said have you seen this movie?  I'm like no.  Have you seen this movie?  No.

0:53 0:56 MALE: So I don't know if that's what started it but then I started watching some movies and--

0:53 0:56 FEMALE: Great.  What's the best one you've seen recently?

1:00 1:04 MALE: Um, I really liked Spanglish.  I was surprised.  I saw it on the plane actually.

1:01 1:02 FEMALE: And that's the best way to see it.

1:06 1:07 MALE: Yeah.

1:03 1:07 FEMALE: It kills time.  You've already paid for it so you don't have to worry about it and--

1:10 1:15 MALE: Yeah, well it's funny because in my apartment complex at Old Creek they have like a little mini movie theater.

1:12 1:15 FEMALE: I heard that but I didn't believe it was true.  [laughter] 

1:17 1:21 MALE: Yeah, it, it's pretty funny.  They have like popcorn, and candy, and stuff, but--

1:18 1:20 FEMALE: Is it just a DVD machine and you can just go--

1:23 1:28 MALE: It's a DVD machine, and it's a big screen, and they have kind of like comfortable like cushion chairs, so--

1:25 1:26 FEMALE: That's awesome.

1:29 1:30 MALE: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1:27 1:27 FEMALE: That's awesome.

1:30 1:38 MALE: But they're showing Spanglish this week so when I was on the plane I was like oh I shouldn't watch it.  It's like, you're not doing any work.

1:35 1:36 FEMALE: [laughter] Exactly.

1:39 1:44 MALE: I went to a friend's wedding this weekend in Milwaukee so I was just exhausted coming back, and--

1:41 1:43 FEMALE: I've never been to Milwaukee.  How was it?

1:48 1:58 MALE: [laughter] It's kind of funny because well I'm from Chicago and all my friends are from Chicago.  He is too.  And he's always on this quest to say how great Milwaukee is.

1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Uh huh, uh huh.

1:59 2:01 MALE: My friend was like oh, Milwaukee, yeah it's fine. 

1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Uh huh.

2:01 2:08 MALE: But it was just like this place is the most lame city I've ever seen.  I felt so bad for my friend because he like--

2:01 2:04 FEMALE: Oh no.  Oh no.

2:08 2:09 MALE: --spent years building it up.

2:06 2:07 FEMALE: Oh no.

2:10 2:15 MALE: I think we just went out and there was nobody out.  It was a Thursday night and-

2:11 2:13 FEMALE: Oh maybe that's it.

2:15 2:17 MALE: --everyone's kind of like what is going on?  

2:14 2:14 FEMALE: Right.

2:17 2:21 MALE: I mean, you should at least be able to find somewhere where some people are out and--

2:18 2:21 FEMALE: Right, especially if you live here you should know where the Thursday night bars are, right?

2:24 2:33 MALE: Well he took us to what he thought was a good bar.  He was [laughter] in this like one bar which is supposed to be one of the best bars, there were two guys in the whole bar. 

2:25 2:26 FEMALE: That sucks.

2:33 2:39 MALE: It was a really big bar too, and uh, so of course my friends you know, they're just like whoa dude.  [laughter] 

2:31 2:35 FEMALE: Uh huh.  [laughter] 

2:41 2:47 MALE: Then the next [unintelligible] and we're just like, like ten seconds after he walks in everyone's like we're out of here.  I felt bad.

2:43 2:48 FEMALE: Oh no, the poor thing.  He was trying so hard.  That's terrible.

2:48 2:52 MALE: And he's going to be married soon so it's like.  Felt sorry for him.

2:49 2:50 FEMALE: That's terrible.

2:53 2:56 MALE: Yeah, well we had fun.  It was, it was funny, so--

2:51 2:51 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:56 3:01 MALE: But Milwaukee is a pretty cool town.  It's, you know, it's a small city so you can get around.  It's not so crowded.  

2:58 2:58 FEMALE: Uh huh.

3:02 3:09 MALE: But it has a lot of things, you know, has like you know, sports teams, and performing arts centers, and stuff like that, so--

3:05 3:11 FEMALE: Right, but if you're used to Chicago then I think-I lived in New York for a long time and now every other city on like--

3:15 3:18 MALE: Nothing compare to New York?  I've never been to New York, so--
