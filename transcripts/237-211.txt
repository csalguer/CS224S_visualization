00:01  00:02	MALE:  Hi.  
00:04  00:05	FEMALE:  Hi.
00:06  00:06	MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].
00:07  00:07 	FEMALE:  I'm female237 [horn]
00:09  00:10	MALE:  Where are you from?
00:10  00:12	FEMALE:  I'm originally from D.C.
00:13  00:13	MALE:  Okay.
00:14  00:18	FEMALE:  D.C. area.  I grew up in the suburbs and then went to school in Massachusetts and ah, --
00:19  00:24	MALE:  That's quite an interesting name actually.  It half sounds like it's an Indian, also that's why I asked.  
00:25  00:25	FEMALE:  Oh okay.
00:26  00:27	MALE:  It has a flavor of some Israeli names also like that, it's a usual name.
00:28  00:30	FEMALE:  It's a Hebrew name.  Yeah, it's a Hebrew -- it's Israeli
00:31  00:32	MALE:  Like Hebrew through the Middle East or Indian.  
00:33  00:35	FEMALE:  Right [laughter].
00:36  00:38	MALE:  Some names it sounds similar.  Like Raggi [phonetic] would be a boy's name.  So that sounds similar.
00:39  00:46	FEMALE:  Okay.  Yeah [laughter].  Yeah, it's a Hebrew name, so.  What about you?  Are you from India?
00:47  00:50	MALE:  Yeah, I'm from India.  And I'm in the PhD program in the new school in here.
00:51  00:52	FEMALE:  Oh, what do you study?
00:53  00:58	MALE:  Operations, research, operations management/industry engineering.
00:59  01:00	FEMALE:  That sounds like quite a bit to bite off.
01:00  01:02	MALE:  Not really, with slashes which ever one you relate to, that's what I do.
01:03  01:04	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
01:05  01:09	MALE:  Because I don't do any of them [laughter].  That's just my department.  What about you?
01:10  01:17	FEMALE:  I'm in the Ed School.  So studying History and Philosophy Education.  So, yeah -- so, nothing [unintelligible]. 
01:18  01:19	MALE:  Masters, PhD?
01:20  01:21	FEMALE:  Masters.
01:22  01:23	MALE:  Masters.  So you're out of here.
01:23  01:24	FEMALE:  I'll be out of here soon.
01:25  01:26	MALE:  And applying to look for a job?
01:26  01:33	FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm applying for jobs now.  So I don't know I've been applying all over, I don't know where I'll end up or what I'll end up doing.
01:34  01:34	MALE:   All the best, I mean --
01:35  01:38	FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's, you know, you just send your stuff out all over the place and --
01:39  01:42	MALE:  Yeah, I'm going to be in that situation in like six months and I'll be applying all over.
01:43  01:43	FEMALE:  What do you want to do?
01:44  01:46	MALE:  Academia, preferably a business school.
01:47  01:58	FEMALE:  So how does the business school academia market work?  I mean, does business school expect that you've had like a certain amount of business experience in addition to a PhD or no?
01:59  02:14	MALE:  They don't care.  I mean, it's good if you like -- they want you to be able to teach them basically.  It's actually bizarre, like you learn how about teaching and [unintelligible] without actually having been to the business world.  But, you know, I'm not in the position to complain, because I don't have any experience.  So I can't go up and say, why don't you put in the requirement for it.  
02:15  02:15	FEMALE:  Right.
02:16  02:22	MALE:  But yeah, I mean it's pretty much direct after the PhD.  
02:23  02:24	FEMALE:  So what would you want to teach?
02:25  02:29	MALE:  What would I -- um, operations, that's pretty much what we can teach. 
02:30  02:34	FEMALE:  Do you -- have you like taught any classes while you've been here?
02:35  02:41	MALE:  I have TA'd a couple of times, but like I haven't taught.  So pretty fresh to me.
02:42  02:50	FEMALE:  Yeah [laughter].  Yeah, so are you kind of just apply -- do you have a sense of what places would be a good fit like or?
02:51  02:58	MALE:  It's really complicated, so you know I don't know.  In the best would be here at Stanford, but you know, that's not happening.
02:59  03:00	FEMALE:  Do they hire there own PhD's in the Business School?
03:01  03:05	MALE:  No but they usually don't.  They have done so, but it's rare and I don't think I'm in that rare category, so.  That's like my -- 
03:06  03:06	FEMALE:  Yeah.
03:07  03:08	MALE:  I work pretty much in the areas of my advisors so, they don't really need me.  
03:09  03:10	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
03:11  03:20	MALE:  That's the rationale; they don't hire you, [unintelligible] than your advisor --
03:21  03:25	FEMALE:  And they already have your advisor so it don't matter [laughter].
03:26  03:27	MALE:  So what do you like to do in your spare time?
03:27  03:28	FEMALE:  Oh, I like to do stuff outside.
03:29  03:30	MALE:  Outside, the box --
03:30  03:31	FEMALE:  Hiking --
03:31  03:31	MALE:  Outside the house --
03:32  03:35	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  You know outside in the sun.
03:36  03:37	MALE:  Ah in the sun, yeah.
03:38  03:44	FEMALE:  Yeah, hiking and stuff like that.  Um, yeah, cooking those things.  What about you?
03:45  03:59	MALE:  Ah, I like going out as well.  Not hiking that much, but I love going to the beach.  So, I mean there have been times where it's sunny here I go to Santa Cruz and its cloudy there and I'm like oh my god.
04:00  04:01	FEMALE:  Doesn't quite work out.
04:02  04:03	MALE:  I like going over to the city.
04:04  04:06	FEMALE:  Yeah, what do you guys do in the city?
04:07  04:10	MALE:  Um, eat out [horn] go to a club or something.
04:11  04:12	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
04:12  04:13	MALE:  Nice meeting you.
