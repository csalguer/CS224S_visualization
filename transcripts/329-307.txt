3:23 3:24 MALE:  [interposing] Are you designing cool stuff?
3:26 3:27 FEMALE:  --and be a lazy bum.

3:43 3:43 MALE:  That's kind of fun.
3:47 3:52 FEMALE:  And just kind of do design stuff and see kind of what I like, then try to figure it out.  And once I figure it out kind of where I want to go, then I can figure out what I want to do with it.
