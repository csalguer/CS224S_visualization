1:25 1:27 MALE:  Okay, is this the first one that you've done or?
1:28 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah, I, yeah. I'd say I didn't really know what to expect.  I, they thought I was a guy actually because you can't tell from my name.  So, I showed up and they're like, oh wait, you're not a guy.  It's like; no I'm not [laughter].
1:32 1:39 MALE:  Okay.  Right.  Okay, you tipped the balance [laughter].

1:46 2:09 FEMALE:  Um, well, I guess I like a lot of things.  Um, I don't know, I like, I like hanging out with friends or going out [laughter].  I know, I feel like I should say something, like really cool, but I mean there's nothing [laughter] particularly unique about that, so [laughter].  I don't know.  You never know when you meet other Stanford people, you're like, oh my gosh, should I like make up something and like be really impressive.
2:08 2:12 MALE:  Oh, yeah, like rock climbing or hang gliding or something like that.
2:10 2:15 FEMALE:  Yeah [laughter], so I'm just like I like to watch TV and hang out with my friends [laughter].

2:29 2:36 MALE:  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.  Well this is a good way to have a break, isn't it?  You like something to get your mind totally away.
2:36 2:53 FEMALE:  You know I wish I could say that this is a break, but like I haven't done very much work today.  Like I basically started and did like half an hour of work and I was like [laughter].  So it's not very much of a break at all [laughter].  It's more like, yeah, I haven't done anything all day and...
2:54 2:58 MALE:  It's going to be a long night.  Are these the finals, finals, or just, have you got next year as well?

3:06 3:07 FEMALE:  Oh, wow, yeah.
3:07 3:12 MALE:  So, yeah opposite ends of the spectrum.  Do you know what you'll do afterwards here?  Have you got something lined up?
3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm going to be an attorney in New York.
3:12 3:13 MALE:  Oh, wow.  
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:14 3:18 MALE:  Okay [laughter].  So having spent all of that time in California your finally moving...
3:19 3:20 FEMALE:  To New York.
3:20 3:21 MALE:  Yeah.
3:21 3:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm just; I'm tired of it here.  I mean I basically lived here my whole life, so 27 years.  If you can imagine that I've never seeing another place.  I mean I've seen other places; I've never lived [unintelligible], so it's like...
3:32 3:33 MALE:  So New York is going to be quite different isn't it?
3:34 3:44 FEMALE:  I think so, like, I've never lived there, but people who are from the east coast are just like, oh, my god you have no idea what you're getting into [laughter].  They're like; the weather is horrible compared to here.
3:43 3:57 MALE:  Yeah, that's life isn't that?  Yeah, it's very much a big city, it's sort of, I've been there a couple of times for holidays and things.  And it's a lot like London is, so, it's like busy all the time, lots of people.  I mean it's a lot like London, so, I think you will enjoy it.
3:51 3:58 FEMALE:  Oh, cool, okay.  I really liked London, [laughter] so that's good [laughter].
3:58 3:59 MALE:  [laughter].
4:00 4:15 FEMALE:  I spent the summer in France and like, I didn't really like Paris actually, so I went London a lot.  And I really like, liked it.  It was like, not only do people feel, like, not only do they speak English, but like, this feels like living in the states.  Like, I think like culturally it's a lot more like the US.  And so I was like, yeah.
4:15 4:18 MALE:  Okay, okay.  Alright, good luck.
4:16 4:20 FEMALE:  Right, I should let you go [laughter].
