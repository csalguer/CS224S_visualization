0:00:04.5 0:00:13.4 MALE:  I screwed up my numbering.  Uh-huh.  I'm male106.
0:00:13.8 0:00:14.4 [horn]
0:00:01.0 0:00:01.9 FEMALE:  Oh, we can start now.
0:00:14.2 0:00:16.5 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  Okay, I'm male106.
0:00:03.1 0:00:05.2 FEMALE:  female128. [laughter] 
0:00:18.2 0:00:18.9 MALE:  How are you doing?
0:00:05.2 0:00:06.1 FEMALE:  I'm good.  How are you?
0:00:19.7 0:00:20.2 MALE:  Pretty good.
0:00:06.6 0:00:08.8 FEMALE:  Good.  So, uh, what do you do?
0:00:22.3 0:00:24.0 MALE:  I'm in computer science here.
0:00:10.5 0:00:10.9 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:00:24.1 0:00:28.8 MALE:  I'm working in the genetics department.  I'm interested in computational biology.  
0:00:15.5 0:00:16.2 FEMALE:  Cool.  
0:00:29.9 0:00:30.4 MALE:  What about you?
0:00:17.2 0:00:18.6 FEMALE:  Um, I work in earth sciences.
0:00:32.5 0:00:32.9 MALE:  In what?
0:00:19.5 0:00:20.5 FEMALE:  Earth sciences.  
0:00:33.7 0:00:34.5 MALE:  Earth sciences.
0:00:20.5 0:00:22.3 FEMALE:  I'm in geophysics and I'm doing- 
0:00:35.4 0:00:36.4 MALE:  Okay, cool.
0:00:22.5 0:00:25.6 FEMALE:  -um, environmental geophysics [unintelligible].  
0:00:38.0 0:00:39.5 MALE:  Uh-huh, PhD then?
0:00:25.5 0:00:26.6 FEMALE:  PhD, yeah, you?
0:00:40.2 0:00:41.4 MALE:  Uh, master's.
0:00:27.7 0:00:28.7 FEMALE:  Master's, okay.
0:00:42.1 0:00:45.9 MALE:  Yeah, so what type of stuff do you study [unintelligible]?  
0:00:32.3 0:00:39.4 FEMALE:  Um, I'm looking at ways to use nuclear magnetic resonance to monitor chemical changes and contaminants--
0:00:53.3 0:00:53.7 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:00:39.6 0:00:42.2 FEMALE:  -in the subsurface- um, in the subsurface. 
0:00:55.7 0:00:58.1 MALE:  Okay.  Do you go out to the field for that much?
0:00:44.3 0:00:46.5 FEMALE:  I don't, unfortunately.  
0:00:59.7 0:01:00.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
0:00:46.2 0:00:49.1 FEMALE:  I just take little samples and stick them in an MMR machine. 
0:01:02.6 0:01:03.0 MALE:  Yeah.
0:00:48.8 0:00:52.8 FEMALE:  And like induce chemical changes and monitor them over time.
0:01:04.9 0:01:07.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  That's-
0:00:54.4 0:00:55.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:08.3 0:01:09.2 MALE:  -all right still. 
0:00:54.9 0:00:57.5 FEMALE:  And I do a lot of lab work [unintelligible] field work.
0:01:10.0 0:01:11.4 MALE:  Uh-huh. Yeah.
0:00:57.6 0:00:59.8 FEMALE:  But hopefully next year I'm going to try and-
0:01:13.9 0:01:14.4 MALE:  And get-
0:01:00.2 0:01:02.9 FEMALE:  -try and get [unintelligible].
0:01:16.1 0:01:18.5 MALE:  Uh-huh, cool.  How long have you been here?
0:01:05.4 0:01:06.4 FEMALE:  I'm in my second year.
0:01:19.9 0:01:20.4 MALE:  Okay.  
0:01:06.4 0:01:07.1 FEMALE:  How about you?
0:01:20.4 0:01:21.5 MALE:  Second year also.  
0:01:08.7 0:01:10.9 FEMALE:  So will you- are you going to finish at the end of this year?
0:01:24.0 0:01:25.5 MALE:  Yeah, I will, uh-huh. 
0:01:11.9 0:01:12.3 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:25.4 0:01:27.9 MALE:  I actually applied for a PhD at a few places.
0:01:14.4 0:01:15.5 FEMALE:  Oh whereabouts?
0:01:28.8 0:01:34.6 MALE:  And- I applied to Stanford, Berkley, Washington, San Diego, and Santa Cruz. 
0:01:20.6 0:01:26.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  So you have to re-apply to Stanford if you want to do a PhD in- in, um- cool.
0:01:36.7 0:01:41.8 MALE:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah.  And I've gotten into Santa Cruz.
0:01:28.5 0:01:30.4 FEMALE:  Good.  Uh-huh.
0:01:42.0 0:01:46.9 MALE:  -and San Diego hasn't answered yet.  So those are my choices at this point.
0:01:32.6 0:01:33.1 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:01:47.3 0:01:48.9 MALE:  And so I'm thinking about it. 
0:01:35.5 0:01:36.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:49.4 0:01:52.8 MALE:  Starting to get second thoughts about whether I want to do the PhD or not.
0:01:38.6 0:01:40.2 FEMALE:  Yeah.  But your-
0:01:52.6 0:01:55.4 MALE:  So, pretty undecided right now.
0:01:41.5 0:01:44.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Would you do the same kind of stuff?  Like-
0:01:58.2 0:01:58.6 MALE:  Huh?
0:01:44.9 0:01:46.5 FEMALE:  Would you do the same kind of stuff?
0:01:59.9 0:02:02.7 MALE:  Yeah, uh, pretty similar I think.
0:01:48.6 0:01:49.1 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
0:02:03.0 0:02:03.4 MALE:  I would.
0:01:50.9 0:01:51.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:04.7 0:02:05.8 MALE:  So, where are you from?
0:01:52.5 0:01:54.3 FEMALE:  I'm from Vancouver, Canada.
0:02:07.6 0:02:08.2 MALE:  Oh yeah.
0:01:54.8 0:01:55.7 FEMALE:  Whereabouts are you from?
0:02:08.9 0:02:09.6 MALE:  Minnesota.  
0:01:56.4 0:01:58.3 FEMALE:  Okay.  And whereabouts in Minnesota.  
0:02:10.4 0:02:12.8 MALE:  So, close to Canada, [unintelligible].  
0:01:59.6 0:02:02.9 FEMALE:  So, you've heard of it?  Good. [laughter] 
0:02:13.7 0:02:16.7 MALE:  Yeah, [laughter] I've heard of that country you speak of.
0:02:04.3 0:02:08.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Um, my- my dad came down and visited me, and he was, um, at the Stanford Mall.  
0:02:21.8 0:02:22.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:09.0 0:02:13.6 FEMALE:  And he started talking to this girl and here the girl said, oh where are you from?  He said, oh, I'm from Canada. 
0:02:26.7 0:02:27.3 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:02:13.4 0:02:17.6 FEMALE:  And she said, oh, oh, that's somewhere in New Jersey isn't it?  And my dad was like-  
0:02:30.2 0:02:32.2 MALE:  [laughter] You're- you're joking, right?
0:02:18.3 0:02:20.6 FEMALE:  No, [unintelligible] actually.
0:02:31.8 0:02:36.6 MALE:  Was this- was this like an American girl, like-
0:02:23.0 0:02:24.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:02:36.3 0:02:37.8 MALE:  -a girl who had grown up in America?  
0:02:24.5 0:02:25.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I guess so.   
0:02:37.5 0:02:39.1 MALE:  And they did- they didn't know where-
0:02:25.5 0:02:31.9 FEMALE:  Didn't know where Canada was.  Yeah, my dad was like, those- those Americans [unintelligible] [laughter]   
0:02:42.0 0:02:47.0 MALE:  That's- that's pretty surprising-
0:02:33.8 0:02:34.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:48.4 0:02:50.1 MALE:  -that they don't know where Canada is.
0:02:36.6 0:02:42.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, um, so what do you do with like computational biology?
0:02:55.8 0:03:05.9 MALE:  Oh, well, I guess examples might be like writing a program that quickly aligns two sequences of DNA. 
0:02:53.2 0:02:53.7 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:03:06.9 0:03:12.2 MALE:  Or maybe finds, uh, patterns in DNA that reoccur a lot because-
0:02:58.9 0:02:59.4 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:12.6 0:03:14.4 MALE:  -they're probably useful for something.  
0:02:59.3 0:03:02.5 FEMALE:  So it's all very genetic coding related    
0:03:15.5 0:03:16.1 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:02.9 0:03:03.5 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:16.2 0:03:20.1 MALE:  Those are the things like I want to do ideally.  
0:03:04.0 0:03:07.6 FEMALE:  Okay.  Yeah.  I know some people who are in biology-
0:03:21.4 0:03:24.4 MALE:  [unintelligible] Uh-huh.  Yeah.
0:03:08.0 0:03:14.9 FEMALE:  -they do sort of statistical analysis of like population dynamics and-  
0:03:25.9 0:03:29.2 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, oh cool.  
0:03:15.3 0:03:16.9 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] so that's why I was wondering. 
0:03:28.9 0:03:32.4 MALE:  Yeah, I guess I don't do any of that stuff.  It's kind of-  
0:03:17.9 0:03:27.0 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, it's [unintelligible].  Yeah.  How- how much, um, how many mathematical applications there are in biology.  
0:03:39.3 0:03:45.4 MALE:  Yeah, uh-huh.  True, there are probably a lot in the field of physics as well- 
0:03:31.5 0:03:32.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:03:45.6 0:03:48.6 MALE:  -probably less surprising I would say.  
0:03:34.4 0:03:38.6 FEMALE:  A lot of it is statistical analysis and stuff.  Looking at trends.  
0:03:51.5 0:03:51.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:39.0 0:03:41.2 FEMALE:  So, where did you do your undergraduate?
0:03:54.0 0:03:54.8 MALE:  At Berkley.  
0:03:41.7 0:03:45.4 FEMALE:  Oh, so you're definitely like staying in California and not moving from here at all.
0:03:57.4 0:04:03.4 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Nah I don't necessarily like Stanford quite as much, but [unintelligible].  
0:03:49.5 0:03:51.2 FEMALE:  Yeah, well I would love to go to Berkeley. 
0:04:04.5 0:04:05.8 MALE:  Yeah, where did you go for undergrad?
0:03:52.7 0:03:54.8 FEMALE:  I went to UBC.  So I stayed in Vancouver.  
0:04:07.8 0:04:08.7 MALE:  UBC?  
0:03:55.4 0:03:56.3 FEMALE:  UBC.
0:04:09.2 0:04:09.7 MALE:  BC?
0:03:56.0 0:03:57.7 FEMALE:  Um, University of British Columbia.  
0:04:10.8 0:04:12.7 MALE:  Okay.  I would have guessed Boston College.  
0:03:59.5 0:04:00.5 FEMALE:  Why? 
0:04:13.4 0:04:14.2 [horn]
0:04:13.8 0:04:14.5 MALE:  BC.  
0:04:01.6 0:04:04.4 FEMALE:  Oh, [laughter] of course, right.  
0:04:16.6 0:04:20.2 MALE:  See, stupid Americans. [laughter]  
0:04:05.9 0:04:07.6 FEMALE:  [laughter] No that makes sense.  
0:04:21.7 0:04:22.2 MALE:  See ya.
0:04:09.1 0:04:09.9 FEMALE:  See ya.
