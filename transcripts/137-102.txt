0:17 0:17 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:17 0:23 FEMALE:  Yes, he's--he's rotated through.  So [laughter] but I don't know if I've actually formally ever met you.

0:23 0:25 MALE:  I don't think--I don't think--

0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  But I know who you are.

0:25 0:27 MALE:  But you know [unintelligible]  

0:27 0:29 FEMALE:  Oh yeah 'cause you're the--you're the guild guy.

0:29 0:30 MALE:  I am the guild guy. 

0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  Sorry, I'm female137.

0:31 0:32 MALE:  female137, nice to meet you.

0:33 0:36 FEMALE:  Nice to meet.  I--I'm the--one of the [unintelligible] 

0:36 0:36 MALE:  Oh.   

0:36 0:37 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] so--

0:37 0:38 MALE:  Cool.

0:38 0:44 FEMALE:  So I've seen you at meetings and I feel like I've seen you at [unintelligible] stuff like that and been like, I know who that guy is and--

0:44 0:45 MALE:  I recognize that guy. 

0:45 0:46 FEMALE:  Exactly.  Exactly.

0:46 0:47 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  Which program are you in?

0:48 0:50 MALE:  I, uh, I'm in the philosophy of education 

0:51 0:54 FEMALE:  Okay.  Do you work with [unintelligible] is he the philosophy guy or--

0:54 0:55 MALE:  There two [unintelligible] 

0:56 0:56 FEMALE:  Okay.  Okay.

0:56 0:59 MALE:  [unintelligible] and there's Dennis [unintelligible] 

0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

1:00 1:05 MALE:  And, uh, I work mostly with Dennis because Dennis tends to philosophy of education research. 

1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:05 1:07 MALE:  Which is my area [unintelligible] 

1:07 1:12 FEMALE:  Okay.  How on earth--I mean how did you get into that realm of education?

1:12 1:14 MALE:  Isn't it strange?  Yeah, I, uh--

1:14 1:15 FEMALE:  Well no, I mean I--I--

1:15 1:17 MALE: No it's really [unintelligible]

1:17 1:20 FEMALE:  In all honesty, outside of the world of education, most people are [unintelligible] so.

1:21 1:22 MALE:  Oh, I know.

1:22 1:27 FEMALE:  Exactly.  So--so that that--so I don't--I don't find it necessarily strange, but I--intriguing.

1:27 1:33 MALE:  No, it's--it's very peculiar.  I--I did my undergrad in--in engineering and in philosophy. I double majored.  

1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  Okay.  Uh-huh.

1:33 1:35 MALE:  And I really, uh, like the philosophy part.

1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:36 1:40 MALE:  Like I--I really like [unintelligible] particular [unintelligible] 

1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:41 1:42 MALE:  [unintelligible] environment ethics that sort of [unintelligible] 

1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:42 1:44 MALE:  Like the stuff that I felt like is more applied philosophy.

1:44 1:44 FEMALE:  Right.

1:44 1:49 MALE:  And, uh, and I really got burned out on--on engineering.

1:49 1:49 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:49 1:52 MALE:  So I did a masters in education. 

1:52 1:52 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:52 1:54 MALE:  And I took a philosophy of education course that I really liked.

1:54 1:54 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:54 1:56 MALE:  And it seemed like a similar sort of thing, like a--

1:57 1:57 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

1:57 1:59 MALE:  Like applied philosophy-- 

1:59 1:59 FEMALE:  Okay.

1:59 2:06 MALE:  In a way that was sort of interesting and meaningful and relevant in a way that it--philosophy can also be very abstract [unintelligible] 

2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:06 2:09 MALE:  That--that aspect of it's never appealed to me.   

2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  Huh--uh.

2:10 2:10 MALE:  [laughter]

2:10 2:19 FEMALE:  No, I think--I think that's probably the one thing that's kind of kept me from taking those is kind of thinking on this nebulous level.  And--and it's just something that I've never connected with.

2:19 2:20 MALE:  Yeah.

2:20 2:26 FEMALE:  And--and I definitely more grounded sort of [laughter].  So what year are you in the program then?

2:26 2:26 MALE:  I'm a second year.

2:27 2:27 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:27 2:28 MALE:  So I still have--

2:28 2:30 FEMALE:  So you're kind of coming up on your big--

2:31 2:36 MALE:  Uh, uh, I'm right now trying to decide exactly what my qualifying paper is gonna be.

2:36 2:36 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:36 2:37 MALE:  But in philosophy it's a little different. 

2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:38 2:40 MALE:  You know other people are trying to design their research studies--

2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:41 2:42 MALE:  --and go [unintelligible] collect data and--

2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Right.

2:42 2:43 MALE:  --do empirical work.   

2:43 2:43 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:43 2:46 MALE:  In philosophy you just sort of [unintelligible] paper that you're working on--

2:46 2:47 FEMALE:  Right.

2:47 2:48 MALE:  --and sort of develop it a little bit further.

2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:48 2:49 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  Okay.

2:49 2:54 MALE:  And it'll be probably at least [unintelligible] related to [unintelligible] I do my dissertation on [unintelligible] 

2:54 2:57 FEMALE:  Right.  Right [unintelligible] 

2:57 2:59 MALE:  So what about yourself?  Are you working on your [unintelligible] or the--

3:00 3:01 FEMALE:  I'm in [unintelligible] so--

3:01 3:02 MALE:  Oh, that's right, you--

3:02 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.

3:03 3:03 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:03 3:09 FEMALE:  Yeah, no I'm working on the finding a job.  So yeah--so--

3:09 3:09 MALE:  And how's that going?

3:11 3:19 FEMALE:  Well I had one interview and I'm waiting to hear.  Um, and the interview went great and I would love the job.  It'd be absolutely perfect, so, um, I'm just--I need to do a writing sample for them--

3:20 3:20 MALE:  Yeah.

3:20 3:32 FEMALE:  So I'm working on that now.  And I need to really set up those informational interviews.  And so it's going--it's going okay.  I think that I really want this one thing so I'm kind of--

3:32 3:32 MALE:  What kind of position [unintelligible] 

3:33 3:38 FEMALE:  It's a research associate position at, uh, The Kaiser Foundation.  So doing public opinion research.

3:39 3:40 MALE:  Oh, that sounds fascinating.

3:40 3:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So I work at the med school now and I worked at a dental school before coming here.  And so my interest has kind of branched out from being not just higher education but actually now into public health.

3:52 3:52 MALE:  Yeah.

3:52 3:57 FEMALE:  And so I'm kind of looking at both education policy and public health type organization so.

3:58 3:59 MALE:  Well that sounds really interesting [unintelligible] 

3:59 4:00 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.

4:00 4:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] program at--at some point [unintelligible] 

4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] 

4:02 4:03 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  Eventually.

4:03 4:03 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

4:04 4:08 FEMALE:  No, no, eventually.  The goal is to get some experience to hopefully--

4:08 4:08 MALE:  Figure out what-- 

4:08 4:10 FEMALE:  --come back here.  [laughter]

4:10 4:11 MALE:  Oh, terrific. 

4:11 4:14 FEMALE:  So we'll--we'll see.  I want to stay in the area though so.
