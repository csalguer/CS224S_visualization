1:47 1:48 MALE:  Which one?
1:47 2:03 FEMALE:  Uh, well the one up the road here.  I don't know what it's called, but I have been up there.  I snuck up there, I think over summer quarters, me and some folks, my cohort went to go check it out and we ran into some people that were taking class up there and they were cool, they let us come in and like take a look at their instruments.
2:04 2:06 MALE:  We tend to like, if somebody [unintelligible].

2:25 2:26 MALE:  They didn't point out -
2:26 2:27 FEMALE:  It was a cloudy night.
2:29 2:29 MALE:  Oh,
2:28 2:29 FEMALE:  So it was a little disappointing.
2:30 2:31 MALE:  At least you know what you're looking at [unintelligible].
2:34 2:42 FEMALE:  There you go, exactly.  Not too much ambiguity there.  So, tell me what's your dissertation work about?

2:48 3:02 MALE:  [unintelligible] little sensor gets static cling from radiation and so [unintelligible] electrons on, so I shine the light on it and kicked the electrons [unintelligible].
3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:02 3:03 MALE:  [unintelligible].
