01:07 01:08 FEMALE: Yeah.  
00:59 01:00 MALE: I try to be out there a lot.  
01:10 01:12 FEMALE: Did you go to undergrad over there or?  
01:02 01:04 MALE: Yeah.  I went to Canton undergrad.  
01:15 01:18 FEMALE: Okay.  I have a friend--my best friend from college lives in Philly.  
01:07 01:08 MALE: Ah.  
01:18 01:19 FEMALE: So I'm very, like, I've seen her campus.  
01:09 01:10 MALE: Does she like it?  
01:21 01:31 FEMALE: Yeah, she works for the City Enquirer there.  She's in journalism, so, um, I guess I would say about her work and stuff.  But I think she likes working [unintelligible] it snows a lot and it snows pretty heavily so...
01:22 01:27 MALE: Yeah, it can.  I forgot what that's like.  I've been out here for about four years now.  
01:37 01:41 FEMALE: Wow.  What are you doing here?  Like, what's your--are you a business school?  
01:30 01:31 MALE: MBA, yeah.  
01:41 01:43 FEMALE: It takes four years?  
01:32 01:35 MALE: No, I worked up the city for a couple of years.  
01:45 01:47 FEMALE: Okay.  You mean San Francisco?  
01:38 01:38 MALE: Yeah, sorry.  
01:48 01:48 FEMALE: How is it?  
01:39 01:39 MALE: I loved it.  
01:50 01:52 FEMALE: Really?  Do you still live there or do you live on campus?  
01:42 01:48 MALE: No, I'm down and out--I miss the city.  I like it better.  It was fun.  
02:00 02:00 FEMALE: Is it kind of boring in Palo Alto?  
01:51 01:52 MALE: Yes, relatively.  
02:02 02:22 FEMALE: I mean, I went to UCLA in Los Angeles.  Here I live on campus in the grad dorms, but it's really different from being in LA where I could, you know, go on Sunset Strip and go to all the clubs and, like, just hear music playing mainly.  And then I come here and I'm, like, I can't even get food late at night.  About the only thing open is, like, nameX in the Box or Taco Bell.
02:12 02:23 MALE: Salad and [unintelligible] before school and that adjustment is huge.  You know, three in the morning you want Chinese past ten o'clock.  
02:35 02:44 FEMALE: I know, like, even the movie--like, we used to have late night movie, like, showing at 12:00.  Here, like, it's 12:30, like, you're out, you know.  Like, that's a lost movie, so I don't know.  That kind of sucks, but...
02:35 02:40 MALE: But it's fine. You know, while you're in school and so--I'm actually amazed there [unintelligible] 
02:50 02:50 FEMALE: For?  
02:40 02:58 MALE:  Um, been working on a business plan, so--my work with people from Stanford may delay that.  So despite my intentions, I may be here for yet another year.  Um, although I'm hoping to spend a lot more time within the city and if I'm just driving myself crazy I may just move up there and just drive down [unintelligible].  We'll see.  
03:09 03:10 FEMALE: That's the thing, I don't know a lot of people [unintelligible].  
03:01 03:02 MALE:  What are you studying?  
03:12   03:25 FEMALE: English.  So a lot of people in my department, I think there's 30 [unintelligible] just based on what's happening, so...  [unintelligible] You don't have many classes, you're just supposed to be writing the dissertation at that time.  
03:15 03:16 MALE:  So what are you writing about?  
03:25 03:34 FEMALE: Oh, I'm not--I'm just taking classes now.  So, yeah, I just got there.  So I don't even know what I'm doing here yet.  I'm like, all right, I'm here.   
03:24 03:25 MALE:  Kind of figure it out. 
03:35 03:36 FEMALE: Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm studying English.  
03:27 03:30 MALE:  What's the goal of your getting your a Ph.D. in English.  To be a professor?  
03:40 03:53 FEMALE: Professionally?  Yeah.  I want to get [unintelligible] but, um, sometimes I [unintelligible].  Yeah.  I like being able to have my own hours, not work in summer and--I don't know.  That's very appealing.  
03:44 03:44 MALE:  Yeah, it's a nice life.  
03:55 04:00 FEMALE: But, uh, I know with business, though, like, you guys, I mean, you work a lot.  I mean, you're kind of [unintelligible] but then if you like it, you know.  
03:52 03:52 MALE:  Right.  That's it.  
04:02 04:02 FEMALE: That's the thing.  
03:53 03:55 MALE: That's the hope, that' your're passionate about it.  
04:04 04:05 FEMALE: Then it's like your baby.
