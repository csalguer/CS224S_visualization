0:00 0:03 FEMALE: I know.  This is too fast for me, I'm sorry.

0:08 0:09 MALE: Uh yes.

0:08 0:09 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  I'm female230.

0:09 0:10 MALE: [unintelligible].

0:10 0:12 FEMALE: [unintelligible] What do you do?

0:12 0:15 MALE: I'm an engineer.  [unintelligible] really like.

0:15 0:21 FEMALE: Me too, yeah, [unintelligible].  Which is like fake engineering basically, so it doesn't really count.

0:21 0:25 MALE: [unintelligible].

0:25 0:30 FEMALE: Mine?  I don't know.  I'm actually here just for a year.  Uh I'm a master's student, yeah.

0:30 0:31 MALE: Very nice.

0:31 0:33 FEMALE: So well, what do I like to do, you mean?

0:33 0:34 MALE: Yeah, yeah [unintelligible].

0:34 0:35 FEMALE: Outside, yeah?

0:34 0:35 MALE: Could be engineering-related.

0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  

0:36 0:37 MALE: That's okay.  I love engineering so [unintelligible].

0:37 0:38 FEMALE: I like my classes, actually.

0:38 0:39 MALE: Yeah.  

0:38 0:42 FEMALE: But I, I choose mostly to take classes which are the entrepreneurships.

0:42 0:43 MALE: Mm-hmm.  

0:42 1:08 FEMALE: Which is why I came to Stanford.  I, I went to the Northeast for college, but then, you know, I came here because I wanted to learn what this famous Silicon Valley vibe was about.  So I'm here.  Um outside of class I like um, I, I have learned something of it.  Some of my friends have caught the bug.  Like, a lot of my friends are starting up startups and, you know, they're spending all their time talking to lawyers and patents and things like that, but I'm not really actually keen on becoming an entrepreneur myself at least at this stage, you know.

1:08 1:11 MALE: Oh okay.  Think you'll just be a consultant, consult [unintelligible]?

1:11 1:14 FEMALE: I'm not--yeah, a consultant earning a lot of money [unintelligible].

1:14 1:15 MALE: Absolutely.

1:15 1:16 FEMALE: Yeah.  No, actually I'm bonded to the Singapore government, so--

1:16 1:17 MALE: Pardon?

1:17 1:27 FEMALE: I'm bonded to the Singapore government, so mostly I'll be back at home um working for the government for a while.  Then after that I'm not sure, but, well, outside of school I like uh music and uh--

1:28 1:29 MALE: [unintelligible] go to any concerts or is this your--?

1:29 1:36 FEMALE: Yes, yeah.  I, I try to, but uh I actually prefer to sing and play myself.  I play piano.

1:36 1:37 MALE: [unintelligible].

1:37 1:52 FEMALE: So that's kind of like something I like to do.  It's very relaxing.  I'm awful with modern music because of that.  I'm like a classical snob, basically.  I'm stuck--I'm stuck in my classical and I, I get as far back as Debussy and that's about it, but--[laughter].  But yourself?  What do you like to do?

1:52 1:58 MALE: Well, let's see, I'm a [unintelligible] so I really have an interest in space and spacecraft.

1:58 1:59 FEMALE: Okay.  

1:59 2:04 MALE: Um [unintelligible] so I'm used to the wide open spaces.

2:04 2:06 FEMALE: You must like Stanford then, it's so pretty here.

2:06 2:11 MALE: It is, it really is pretty.  I'm not used to all the green, but you know [unintelligible].

2:11 2:13 FEMALE: Been to Yosemite and Highway 1?  You should.

2:13 2:19 MALE: I [unintelligible] Highway 1 down to um [unintelligible] and then down to Monterey.

2:19 2:20 FEMALE: Yeah.  

2:20 2:25 MALE: And then [unintelligible] I haven't gone [unintelligible].  Have you gone there [unintelligible]?

2:25 2:26 FEMALE: I've been to see Yosemite.

2:26 2:27 MALE: Oh, Yosemite.

2:27 2:31 FEMALE: Um we're planning a Seattle road trip, my friends and I, pretty soon, so I'm going to be going pretty far north, but.

2:32 2:34 MALE: Uh, let's see, um--

2:34 2:36 FEMALE: So how many more years do you have in your program?

2:36 2:37 MALE: [unintelligible].

2:37 2:38 FEMALE: You're done?

2:38 2:39 MALE: Turned in the thesis in December.

2:39 2:40 FEMALE: Awesome.

2:40 2:42 MALE: And so now I'm just doing research in the lab and life [unintelligible].

2:42 2:46 FEMALE: So good, isn't it.  I know, life is good.

2:46 2:50 MALE: [unintelligible] so I'm thinking, this sounds great, why [unintelligible] after five years why did I just hear about this now.

2:50 2:57 FEMALE: [laughter] No uh, my roommates are here--and I are here together.  It's like a girls' night out.  One of my roommates knows the uh researcher.

2:57 2:58 MALE: Oh okay.

2:58 2:59 FEMALE: And the other one knows uh [unintelligible], so--

2:59 3:00 MALE: Okay.

3:00 3:01 FEMALE: It's natural that we're all down here.

3:02 3:03 MALE: [unintelligible].

3:03 3:08 FEMALE: Yeah.  So what do you plan to do since you're graduating so soon?

3:08 3:20 MALE: Well, I'm at the moment still working on uh the research that I was doing earlier here.  Uh it was a project for JPL.  Uh we're hoping to get [unintelligible] so I hope to keep working on [unintelligible] projects like [unintelligible].

3:19 3:20 FEMALE: Okay.  

3:20 3:23 MALE: That kind of stuff.  Still would love to build spaceships [unintelligible].

3:23 3:25 FEMALE: [laughter] So would you work--but, are you American citizen?

3:25 3:26 MALE: Oh yeah.

3:26  3:30 FEMALE: Okay.  See your accent is a little bit--slightly different from other Americans, so I was wondering.

3:30 3:33 MALE: Yeah, you know that's Colorado.  [unintelligible] so--

3:33 3:34 FEMALE: Right.  

3:34 3:37 MALE: [unintelligible] the country.  [unintelligible].

3:37 3:41 FEMALE: [laughter] Oh, don't say that.  Don't say that.  A lot of my friends at Yale--actually, I went to Yale for college.

3:41 3:42 MALE: Oh okay.

3:42 3:49 FEMALE: A lot of my friends were from, like, Nebraska, um all over Texas, all over the place, so I think there's, there's whatever.

3:50 3:51 MALE: I always enjoy [unintelligible] myself.

3:51 3:57 FEMALE: I do too.  Uh but I mean sometimes I think people are naturally attracted to people who are different from them.

3:57 3:58 MALE: Sure.

3:58 4:02 FEMALE: I think that's--I think that, that would be the rationale.  [horn] Yeah.  But it was nice to meet you.
