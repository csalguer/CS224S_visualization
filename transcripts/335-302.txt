0:00:08.6 0:00:11.9 FEMALE:   Yeah, I was born here, but my parents and sister immigrated.

0:00:14.1 0:00:18.7 MALE:  [unintelligible].  A friend of mine was [unintelligible] in Madras.  
0:00:19.1 0:00:20.1 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:00:19.5 0:00:20.7 MALE:  So I'm aware of it.  
0:00:21.2 0:00:23.3 FEMALE:   That's where my cousin is going to school now.  
0:00:23.0 0:00:23.4 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:00:24.0 0:00:28.6 FEMALE:  Yeah, he's studying computer science and electrical engineering.  Yeah.  
0:00:28.3 0:00:29.5 MALE:  I go to India in August.  
0:00:30.3 0:00:31.5 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah?  For the first time?
0:00:30.2 0:00:33.5 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, for the first time.  Well, I've been in Sri Lanka once.
0:00:34.0 0:00:34.4 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:00:33.9 0:00:37.1 MALE:  But never to India.  So I'll be there like for two weeks.  
0:00:35.4 0:00:38.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  That's great.  
0:00:37.6 0:00:42.8 MALE:  I'll be in Bangalore and we'll probably go to Madras also and then Delhi.  
0:00:43.4 0:00:48.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.  That'll be great.  You know, it's funny, I- because whenever we go, we go to see my family, and my- 
0:00:47.9 0:00:48.3 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:00:48.8 0:01:01.4 FEMALE:   And so I actually haven't been- like, I haven't seen the Taj Mahal.  I haven't been in the north.  So whenever I- whenever I meet people who go, um, they tend to get to see so much of India, and I- I'm sort of jealous because I, [laughter] I wish I could go like that.  
0:00:59.1 0:01:02.9 MALE:  [laughter] You spend more time in the US than in India?
0:01:03.4 0:01:10.3 FEMALE:  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  I haven't been back in a while, actually.  Um, and we- we travel to Europe more when we go out of the country.  
0:01:09.0 0:01:09.7 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:01:10.7 0:01:21.3 FEMALE:  Um, but I don't know.  The last few years, I've just been at school so much, and now- now I'm starting to travel again, so I'm excited.  This year, I'm going to Alaska in a month for a conference, which I'm really excited about.  
0:01:18.9 0:01:24.9 MALE:  Oh, my God.  In a month, yeah, so it's going to be okay.  The weather won't be that, uh, that cold.
0:01:25.1 0:01:27.4 FEMALE:  No, but it'll be light all the time, so that'll be fun.  
0:01:26.4 0:01:27.8 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  [laughter] 
0:01:27.7 0:01:32.0 FEMALE:   Uh, and then I'm going to the Galapagos in September.  
0:01:31.1 0:01:31.9 MALE:  Oh, my God.  
0:01:32.4 0:01:34.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm excited.  
0:01:33.1 0:01:34.5 MALE:  What- what are you- what are you doing there?
0:01:35.3 0:01:39.6 FEMALE:  I'm TA'ing a sophomore college seminar that is for Stanford undergrads.  
0:01:38.9 0:01:39.3 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:01:39.6 0:01:45.2 FEMALE:   And it's three weeks long, and for two weeks of it we're in the Galapagos, which I'm really thrilled about because- 
0:01:44.3 0:01:46.1 MALE:  It's to what- to study evolution, or what?
0:01:46.6 0:01:52.7 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uh- I study- I study evolution, and, uh, so we're going to look at birds and things.  
0:01:47.0 0:01:53.2 MALE:  Okay.  [laughter] Okay.  Like Darwin?
0:01:54.0 0:01:54.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:01:53.6 0:01:55.1 MALE:  Following the steps of Darwin?
0:01:55.7 0:02:02.5 FEMALE:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I don't imagine that I'm going to have as big a discovery as he did when went there, but I think it'll be really fun.  
0:01:59.3 0:02:06.5 MALE:  [laughter] Yeah.  Well, yeah, for sure.  I guess that's pretty- that's pretty nice part of the world.
0:02:07.0 0:02:15.6 FEMALE:   Yeah, especially- the thing I've heard about it from some people I know that who've gone there is that anybody can be a good photographer there because the animals are- like, they're not afraid of humans.  
0:02:14.5 0:02:14.9 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:02:15.5 0:02:22.7 FEMALE:   They just kind of look at you.  [laughter] You can take a picture, so, um, I'm excited about that because it'll be fun to have great pictures [laughter].
0:02:21.5 0:02:23.6 MALE:  Well, that's a nice, uh- that's a nice journey.  
0:02:24.6 0:02:26.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.   
0:02:24.5 0:02:28.0 MALE:  For sure.  And, uh, and when you go to Europe, where are you going? 
0:02:29.0 0:02:35.7 FEMALE:  Um, Germany, mostly.  Um, so there's an institute that does work similar to mine in Leipzig, but- 
0:02:35.0 0:02:35.4 MALE:   In what?  
0:02:36.2 0:02:37.1 FEMALE:   In Leipzig.
0:02:35.4 0:02:36.7 MALE:  Oh, in Leipzig.  Okay.  
0:02:37.4 0:02:44.9 FEMALE:   Yeah, but, uh, my parents, um, we lived for- in Germany for a year.  I went to school there in seventh grade.  So we lived in Regensburg in Bavaria.  
0:02:41.5 0:02:46.4 MALE:  Okay.  So you speak German?  Okay.
0:02:46.1 0:02:53.8 FEMALE:   I do.  Yes.  [laughter] Yeah, not as fluently as I used to, but I still read a lot of it, so, yeah.  
0:02:53.7 0:02:55.8 MALE:  Yeah, I learned German at school- at school.  
0:02:56.6 0:02:57.0 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
0:02:55.9 0:02:59.4 MALE:  But I was not a big fan, so- 
0:02:58.8 0:03:01.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Of the language, or the country or both?
0:03:01.1 0:03:03.4 MALE:  Uh, both [laughter].
0:03:01.8 0:03:06.8 FEMALE:  [laughter] Both?  [laughter] I can understand that. [laughter]  
0:03:06.1 0:03:08.2 MALE:  Well, I'm French, so there is sort of a- 
0:03:09.7 0:03:10.9 FEMALE:  Right, yeah.  
0:03:09.8 0:03:13.0 MALE:  Antagonism between German and French, but it's, uh- 
0:03:13.6 0:03:19.4 FEMALE:  So, how do you feel about American people trying to speak French when they go to France?  Like, is it appreciated or not? 
0:03:18.1 0:03:18.8 MALE:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
0:03:19.8 0:03:20.3 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:03:19.2 0:03:33.1 MALE:  Yeah, the main critiques that- uh, a lot of French people are very unfriendly because they- they- they feel like American are very arrogant.  They like they arrive in France and they don't try to speak the language.  They're like, okay.  I speak English.  Everyone has to speak English.
0:03:34.3 0:03:35.9 FEMALE:  Uh, that I can understand, yeah.  
0:03:34.3 0:03:42.6 MALE:  So if an- if an- if an American, uh, make an effort- makes an effort to speak French, even if he- or she doesn't speak very well- 
0:03:43.8 0:03:44.6 FEMALE:  It's appreciated.  
0:03:43.5 0:03:48.8 MALE:  Except for- except in Paris because basically, Parisian don't like anyone, so-  [laughter]
0:03:48.8 0:03:59.2 FEMALE:  [laughter] So that's good to know.  Yeah 'cause we used to- my father kind of speaks a little French, and when we would go to Germany, we'd go to [unintelligible] a lot, and there, they always seem very nice.  Yeah.  
0:03:54.8 0:03:56.7 MALE:  Yeah.  Oh [unintelligible].  
0:03:59.9 0:04:00.9 FEMALE:  Yeah, I like [unintelligible].  
0:04:00.1 0:04:00.7 [horn]
0:03:59.8 0:04:07.9 MALE:  I- I [unintelligible] for three years.  It's a nice city.  But Parisians are not nice at all.  Avoid Paris.  [laughter].  
0:04:06.3 0:04:09.6 FEMALE:  That's good to know.  All right.  [laughter]
0:04:08.2 0:04:10.0 MALE:  Okay.  It was nice to meet you.  
0:04:11.0 0:04:11.8 FEMALE:   It was nice to meet you, too.
0:04:10.6 0:04:11.8 MALE:  [unintelligible].  
0:04:12.5 0:04:13.1 FEMALE:   Bye.
