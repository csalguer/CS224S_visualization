1:46 1:46 MALE:  How big is the law PhD program here? 

1:48 1:49 FEMALE:  Very small.  Last year, [unintelligible] year they took six of us, but they wanted to take five and last year they took three and they haven't decided how many.  We are very few. 

2:03 2:04 MALE:  So what's your area of interest? 

2:05 2:08 FEMALE:  Constitutional law and maybe -- I don't [unintelligible]. 

2:13 2:14 MALE:  What's that? 

2:14 2:14 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]. 

2:15 2:15 MALE:  Okay, got to get big companies, not a fan of big companies? 

2:18 2:18 FEMALE:  No, I don't like big companies.  I'm very used to monopolies, I don't like them. 

2:22 2:22 MALE:  Terrible. 

2:23 2:24 FEMALE:  What's your department? 

2:26 2:26 MALE:  I'm in electrical engineering. 

2:27 2:27 FEMALE:  Electrical engineering. 

2:28 2:29 MALE:  Yeah and I do like -- I actually work with this woman in computer science and do like artificial intelligence stuff. 

2:38 2:39 FEMALE:  Oh good.  That's pretty [unintelligible]. 

2:41 2:42 MALE:  So it's fun.  I like it.  I mean I'm in year three, but for me it's going to be at least two more if not three more. 

2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]. 

2:49 2:49 MALE:  Five.  I actually had to switch advisors part of the way through it, so that was kind of a little bit of a hitch in the road, but I mean I like it here so -- right. 

2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  Right I mean there's not much to complain. 

3:01 3:01 MALE:  Exactly. 

3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  I mean there is [unintelligible] relative to all of the [unintelligible] if you have friends in Yale or Harvard that say where are you, how are you.  I mean I get e-mails from my friends from Yale and they would say like "female233, it's many degrees below zero." 

3:14 3:16 MALE:  The only question is, whether it made sense to go with the higher paying job option you know, but it's not like I spend that much.  But you like it here? 

3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  I like it here a lot [unintelligible]. 

3:29 3:30 MALE:  Do you think you'll stay in California?

3:34 3:35 MALE:  New York City.  You like the city huh? 

3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Well I mean yeah, I guess.  I mean, but for many years it's not -- everybody said it's a huge city, like, you know like [unintelligible] I don't find that.  For me personally it's not.  Everything is relative. 

3:52 3:53 MALE:  Yeah I guess.  Yeah I -- I've been up to New York City a couple of times, but it was never really my thing.  I guess I just like having space or something I don't know or I like grass and fields and I don't know. 

4:05 4:05  FEMALE:  Oh well I love that too, I have to say.  But I love the city too. 

4:07 4:08 MALE:  Yeah okay.  Well good luck.  It was good to meet you.
