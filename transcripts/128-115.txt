0:17 0:18 MALE:  Hi, nice to meet you.
0:18 0:18 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]?  
0:20 0:22 MALE:  Oh yeah, so you were talking to nameX.  
0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  Yeah, how do you guys know each other?
0:24 0:26 MALE:  Because she was [unintelligible] in range. 
0:26 0:26 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:28 0:28 MALE:  Did you know that?
0:27 0:32 FEMALE:  Okay, no, I didn't.  I'm--I just know her--she's in the same department, or she's in the school of earth science. 0:34 0:39 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know her because she used to be [unintelligible].  So am I.  
0:39 0:39 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:41 0:45 MALE:  You know, she just decided to--I mean she couldn't be in a PA any more. 
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:47 0:48 MALE:  But yeah, I do know her.
0:47 0:51 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.  So, how do you like being a PA, at [unintelligible]?
0:52 0:57 MALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible].  I like it.  It's a very good experience at times.  You get to know a lot of people. 
0:57 0:57 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm sure.
0:59 1:10 MALE:  You organize all of these events.  Um, for me it was weird.  I had been attending the events for years, and then I just thought it would be cool too organize some events myself. 
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  What kinds of events do you organize?
1:12 1:14 MALE:  Well, I organize movies.  
1:13 1:14 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:15 1:35 MALE:  For instance, I am--in general organize an event by yourself.  You always do it with someone else.  So, we organize a lot of free lunches, or we order food from somewhere and take it there for, you know.  We put it on the table, and then people gather.  And so--it's very good.  So, what's your program?  
1:35 1:36 FEMALE:  I'm in geophysics.
1:37 1:42 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  Sorry. Good, good.  So, uhm, how do you like Stanford?
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  I like Stanford.  How about you?  
1:45 1:46 MALE:  I do like it too.  
1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  What program are you in?  
1:48 1:48 MALE:  Oh, in physics.  
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  In physics?  
1:50 1:50 MALE:  Yeah.
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  What do you study?  
1:52 1:55 MALE:  I do biocomputation with proteins.
1:55 1:57 FEMALE:  Okay, with protons did you say? 
1:59 2:04 MALE:  Proteins.  I--whenever I say that word they don't understand me, proteins, proteins.  
2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  Proteins.  
2:05 2:23 MALE:  Proteins, proteins, proteins.  Okay.  [laughter]  Proteins--I can't imagine the person transcribing these things, or apparently they're transcribing.  They're going to complete the word proteins, proteins, seventeen times.  [laughter]  I guess I will--
2:23 2:26 FEMALE:  Can you just like [unintelligible] my conversation each time. 
2:28 2:28 MALE:  Oh, really.  
2:27 2:31 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think I'm making it easy for whoever is typing this. 
2:31 2:38 MALE:  Oh, really.  To tell you the truth now I am starting to feel tired.  
2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, me too.  
2:39 2:43 MALE:  That's why I don't know if I tell you--told you something already or not. 
2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  Okay, I'll tell you if you're repeating yourself. 
2:46 2:49 MALE:  Exactly, that's the point because I said some things maybe 10 times already.  
2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly. 
2:51 2:55 MALE:  And then I don't know if I've told you about it or not already.  So, it seems to me I've been talking to you for an hour.  [laughter]  
2:57 2:59 FEMALE:  You haven't repeated yourself.  I'll let you know.  
3:01 3:02 MALE:  I cannot find this one.  
3:02 3:03 FEMALE:  Whereabouts are you from?
3:05 3:05 MALE:  I'm sorry.  
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  Where are you from? 
3:07 3:07 MALE:  I come from Spain.  
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  From Spain?  
3:09 3:10 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Where you come from?  
3:10 3:11 FEMALE:  I'm from Canada.  
3:12 3:14 MALE:  Oh, Canada.  Where in Canada?
3:13 3:13 FEMALE:  Vancouver.  
3:15 3:19 MALE:  Oh, Vancouver.  I have to go--that's very close to Seattle, right?  
3:19 3:20 FEMALE:  It's a three and a half hour drive. 
3:21 3:22 MALE:  Oh, it looks so close on the map.  
3:23 3:24 FEMALE:  It is very close.  
3:25 3:29 MALE:  What else is close to Seattle and is in Canada?  It's Vancouver.  
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Maybe it's less than three and a half hours.  
3:32 3:38 MALE:  Because on the map, on the map it looks--I tell you, ah, it must be one hour away, yeah.  But...
3:38 3:40 FEMALE:  Well, it's 17 hours to drive from here to Vancouver. 
3:42 3:43 MALE:  Oh, my gosh, have you done it?  
3:43 3:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:44 3:49 MALE:  Really?  Wow.  Why did you do it?  Did you like it, or just cheaper?  
3:48 3:50 FEMALE:  I got a new car, and I wanted to drive the car.
3:52 3:53 MALE:  That's a good idea.  
3:52 3:54 FEMALE:  It took a long time [unintelligible].  
3:56 3:59 MALE:  That's a good idea. Yeah.  
3:59 4:02 FEMALE:  It wasn't as long a drive as I thought it was going to be.
4:03 4:06 MALE:  That's right, very good.  Okay, nice to meet you. 
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Very  nice to meet you.
