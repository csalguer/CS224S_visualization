0:02:11.7 0:02:14.6 FEMALE:  I grew up around here.  I was in Hong Kong for my first twelve years.
0:02:16.2 0:02:16.8 MALE:  Okay.

0:02:19.0 0:02:19.7 MALE:  Yeah. 
0:02:17.9 0:02:18.4 FEMALE:  That's cool.
0:02:19.5 0:02:23.3 MALE:  Yeah, uh, but I- I grew up in- in New York, in the city. 
0:02:21.0 0:02:21.5 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:02:23.5 0:02:26.3 MALE:  But I- I spent like five years, six years in Hong Kong.
0:02:24.7 0:02:29.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Cool.  So you like the east coast better or is this [unintelligible] 
0:02:30.1 0:02:31.4 MALE:  I actually- I actually like it here better.  
0:02:29.8 0:02:30.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:32.1 0:02:43.8 MALE:  Yeah.  Um, I just- I just feel like it's just so much more relaxed and, uh, I think that the- like people growing up here have a much easier time than some- some places in New York, so, uh-
0:02:38.9 0:02:43.4 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] What's New York like?  I've never-
0:02:45.0 0:02:45.5 MALE:  You've never been there?
0:02:44.1 0:02:49.0 FEMALE:  I've been there once but it's always kind of intimidating just because there are so many people and all sorts of stuff.
0:02:50.5 0:02:54.7 MALE:  Okay.  Um, it's okay.  It's a cool place, a lot of people around. 
0:02:53.0 0:02:53.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:02:55.4 0:03:04.3 MALE:  It's pretty exciting to a lot of people who haven't been there like ever.  But, uh, I think after a while like it just- it's just so much hustle and bustle that it seems like it-
0:03:01.2 0:03:01.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:04.1 0:03:12.0 MALE:  -will be better to live somewhere in the- nice and quiet and things like that.  So I'm pretty set on like- like-, uh, migrating and staying around here.
0:03:09.9 0:03:12.4 FEMALE:  [laughter] Migrating.  That's a good word.
0:03:13.3 0:03:18.9 MALE:  I can't think of a word. [laughter]  So like staying around here or going up to Seattle or somewhere like that, so-
0:03:17.2 0:03:19.8 FEMALE:  Yeah, cool.  That's awesome.	
0:03:21.0 0:03:23.1 MALE:  Like, uh, uh, how did you like undergrad here?
0:03:21.8 0:03:27.9 FEMALE:  Um, I like it here.  I actually really like Stanford.  Um, I stayed around for five years.  That's a long time.
0:03:28.8 0:03:29.8 MALE:  Co-term.  You did co-term?
0:03:28.4 0:03:29.5 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I was a co-term.  
0:03:31.3 0:03:33.0 MALE:  Okay.  And, uh-
0:03:30.8 0:03:39.2 FEMALE:  But I like it.  Um, it's just kind of open and relaxed.  Like, people work hard but not to the point of they're insane.  It's kind of balanced.  I think balance is a good thing.
0:03:37.5 0:03:44.7 MALE:  Yeah.  That's good.  Um, yeah, I- I like the place a lot. 
0:03:43.2 0:03:43.6 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:44.5 0:03:46.4 MALE:  I- I went to the undergrad at CalTech.
0:03:45.0 0:03:45.4 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:46.7 0:03:48.5 MALE:  And I feel like this is so much better here. 
0:03:46.7 0:03:47.3 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:49.9 0:03:54.0 MALE:  I really like it, so-  I wish- I wish I could have gotten- gotten into here for undergrad.
0:03:52.5 0:03:59.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  My sister went to MIT and she's  like- and now she's here for her Master's.  Then she's like, why did I go to MIT?  
0:04:00.4 0:04:01.3 [horn]
0:03:59.5 0:04:01.6 FEMALE:  So we're like I don't know, we told you not to.
