01:32  	01:32  	MALE:  .Yeah. Yeah. Lance's last time

01:33  	01:40  	FEMALE:  Because I'm kind of excited because he had said for a while that he wasn't going to come back and tour.  I had like who else am I going to root for, because [unintelligible] about Tyler until he started bad mouthing Tyler Hamilton

01:40	01:40	MALE:  Tyler -- yeah, yeah I know who you're talking about

01:41  	02:08  	FEMALE:  Because I was so impressed with him when he broke his shoulder.  But it was probably stupid, but I was very impressed with like he kept going on.  But then I heard last year he was really bad mouthing Lance.  Basically he would do anything including sabotaging his own race to also sabotage Lance Armstrong's race.  So I can't really root for him when he's that mean.

02:09  	02:10  	MALE:  But who knows if it's just hear say [unintelligible].  So that's cool. 

02:10  	02:12  	FEMALE:  Right, so.

02:13  	02:14  	MALE:  Well where are you from?

02:14  	02:14  	FEMALE:  I grew up in New York.

02:15  	02:15  	MALE:  New York which part of New York?

02:15  	02:17  	FEMALE:  Near Poughkeepsie. 

02:18  	02:22  	MALE:  Way up there, no, sort of -- I was thinking of New York where Poughkeepsie is exactly.

02:22  	02:23  	FEMALE:  Poughkeepsie is on the Connecticut border.

02:24  	02:26  	MALE:  Okay.  So over here some where?

02:26  	02:30  	FEMALE:  So yeah, so it's on -- it's the piece that's hanging down the Hudson River goes up we're about [unintelligible].

02:32  	02:33  	FEMALE:  We're still on the low part --

02:33  	02:34  	MALE:  The low part, okay -- 

02:35  	02:49  	FEMALE:  We're certainly -- see the thing is we're the unwanted land.  So if you ask someone from New York City they're going to say that I'm upstate.  But if you say upstate, I think of Buffalo you know so upstate doesn't want us, down state does want us.  So we're kind of floating in the middle.

03:09  	03:10  	MALE:  Okay, okay.  That's cool.

03:11  	03:15  	FEMALE:  And TJ Watson helped [unintelligible] education so I have a soft spot in my heart for him.

03:15  	03:16  	MALE:  Were you up in New York for college.

03:16  	03:21  	FEMALE:  No, just because they have like scholarship program for children of employees.
