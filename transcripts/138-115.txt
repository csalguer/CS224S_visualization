0:00:29.8 0:00:33.2 MALE:  Another EE.  [laughter] I am in physics. 
0:00:33.2 0:00:33.9 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
0:00:34.0 0:00:35.5 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Are you a first year?
0:00:35.6 0:00:36.0 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:36.4 0:00:40.3 MALE:  [unintelligible] first year.  Like so far everyone is first year. [laughter] 
0:00:39.6 0:00:40.2 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?  
0:00:40.2 0:00:41.4 MALE:  Yeah. [laughter] 
0:00:40.5 0:00:42.8 FEMALE:  Because it's hard to meet people outside of your major. 
0:00:42.5 0:00:46.7 MALE:  Oh that's true.  But that's true in your first year, your second year, your third year.
0:00:46.2 0:00:46.9 FEMALE:  And [unintelligible] 
0:00:47.3 0:00:48.8 MALE:  It's always hard at Stanford. 
0:00:48.8 0:00:49.9 FEMALE:  So what year are you?
0:00:49.9 0:00:51.2 MALE:  I'm, uh, in my third year.
0:00:51.1 0:00:52.2 FEMALE:  Third year.  Okay.  
0:00:51.9 0:00:52.3 MALE:  Yeah.
0:00:51.9 0:00:55.2 FEMALE:  So you've kind of settled into your program and now trying to-
0:00:54.8 0:00:56.2 MALE:  Yeah.  Exactly.
0:00:56.2 0:00:57.0 FEMALE:  -explore. 
0:00:57.7 0:01:03.4 MALE:  Well actually you are always trying to explore.  You know, actually, I hadn't- I've never done a speed dating thing like this. 
0:01:03.1 0:01:10.4 FEMALE:  Yeah, I just wanted to try it 'cause like- I was like I want to skydive [laughter] and like ski out of a helicopter.  It's like, I want to try all those things once just to say I tried it.
0:01:09.2 0:01:09.8 MALE:  Exactly.
0:01:10.1 0:01:10.7 FEMALE:  You know?
0:01:10.6 0:01:14.5 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's a good idea.  That's exactly what I'm doing.  
0:01:14.4 0:01:15.5 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
0:01:15.0 0:01:17.7 MALE:  Actually, so I've been here for two and a half years. 
0:01:17.5 0:01:17.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:18.0 0:01:23.0 MALE:  And then there were- I heard about these speed dating things and I- 
0:01:22.6 0:01:24.2 FEMALE:  Oh, so it's a common Stanford thing. 
0:01:24.2 0:01:26.4 MALE:  I think so.  I believe you'll hear it twice a year.
0:01:25.7 0:01:27.4 FEMALE:  Okay.  I know a lot of people get married here.
0:01:27.9 0:01:28.7 MALE:  Oh really?
0:01:28.4 0:01:31.6 FEMALE:  I've seen a lot of couples that like, you know, Stanford couples.
0:01:31.8 0:01:32.4 MALE:  Oh really?
0:01:32.5 0:01:33.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:33.1 0:01:36.4 MALE:  I don't know.  I mean this- the dating seems pretty bad I think.
0:01:36.9 0:01:38.4 FEMALE:  But there's not much to do. [laughter] 
0:01:38.2 0:01:38.9 MALE:  I know.
0:01:38.1 0:01:40.4 FEMALE:  I mean you don't, you know, have your friends to hang out with.
0:01:40.7 0:01:47.2 MALE:  I know.  But it's- I mean I think it's cool.  I guess- I said I will give it a shot, like why not.  You know?
0:01:46.2 0:01:51.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Like I'm open to new things.  And I want to say I've done everything Stanford has to offer, you know.
0:01:46.9 0:01:54.9 MALE:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  So have you gone skiing or something like that? 
0:01:54.8 0:01:56.3 FEMALE:  Skiing here?  Not yet.
0:01:56.3 0:01:56.7 MALE:  Oh.
0:01:56.1 0:02:00.7 FEMALE:  I was trying to like tackle my load of homework like the first few quarters- 
0:01:59.5 0:02:00.4 MALE:  Oh.
0:02:00.5 0:02:06.7 FEMALE:  -and trying to decide if I want to join a research group.  So I was like, you know, maybe I'll settle in and then like break out and do everything. 
0:02:06.7 0:02:07.1 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:07.1 0:02:08.5 FEMALE:  When the classes start- stop. 
0:02:08.7 0:02:13.4 MALE:  Yeah.  Same- same for me.  Like when I came here it was so busy like in the beginning. 
0:02:12.0 0:02:16.5 FEMALE:  Yeah, I felt like a undergrad it's so much- like I have three problem sets every week- and it's just crazy.
0:02:16.6 0:02:23.1 MALE:  I know.  I know it's- it's Stanford, you know, well you will finish your- so you want to do PhD or a master's?
0:02:22.8 0:02:26.2 FEMALE:  Um, originally I came for a PhD but now I'm not sure. 
0:02:24.4 0:02:24.9 MALE:  Oh.
0:02:25.9 0:02:27.7 FEMALE:  If I could get into a good group then that's good. 
0:02:27.7 0:02:30.4 MALE:  Oh, okay so you should figure it out first.
0:02:30.5 0:02:33.2 FEMALE:  Yeah kind of like the- if I want to stay or not.
0:02:33.8 0:02:41.1 MALE:  I know.  I know. I mean at least for me, I can tell you that- so when I came to Stanford it was like a big shock for me. You know?   
0:02:40.7 0:02:41.3 FEMALE:  Where are you from?
0:02:41.2 0:02:42.0 MALE:  I'm from Spain.
0:02:42.0 0:02:42.5 FEMALE:  Oh okay.
0:02:42.4 0:03:01.9 MALE:  So it was so different.  You know, so the first few weeks it was very cool because it looked so nice.  But then you realize it's a different culture and all that and it's a lot of work and- like the staff [laughter].  And then I was- uh, it was- I wasn't sure [unintelligible] I think you will end up getting more accustomed to it and you will somehow love it.
0:03:02.4 0:03:03.1 FEMALE:  Okay.  Okay.
0:03:02.4 0:03:07.2 MALE:  So probably now you're not so sure about doing your PhD but maybe you- like later on you will decide [unintelligible] 
0:03:06.1 0:03:17.0 FEMALE:  Maybe.  I notice I'm coming back like into my old self again.  Like, oh that research is cool.  That's cool.  Before the first quarter I was like, oh, I don't know, I just kind of wanted to hide out.  I didn't want to talk to my professors.
0:03:16.9 0:03:20.1 MALE:  Oh you shouldn't do that.  I know the one place [unintelligible] 
0:03:19.1 0:03:23.7 FEMALE:  Well but I don't- I don't want my professors to know that I'm not sure, right.  Because like later on--
0:03:22.8 0:03:26.9 MALE:  But they- they know- but they know that you- you cannot be sure.  They assume that in fact. 
0:03:27.3 0:03:27.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:27.5 0:03:30.0 MALE:  Yeah, yeah absolutely.  You shouldn't be [unintelligible] 
0:03:29.3 0:03:33.4 FEMALE:  But I mean you explain it, so it's like default every student is unsure until they get their degree.
0:03:33.9 0:03:37.6 MALE:  Kind of.  Like actually I've seen people changing groups after one year.
0:03:36.8 0:03:37.4 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:38.4 0:03:42.3 MALE:  I mean you sh- you- you shouldn't be afraid about that.  I mean that's my advice.    
0:03:42.3 0:03:43.0 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:03:42.7 0:03:52.9 MALE:  I was a little bit like that as well and that doesn't work at Stanford.  You know this is like very competitive so you have to be a little bit more pushing-
0:03:51.2 0:03:51.7 FEMALE:  Pushy?
0:03:52.6 0:03:58.1 MALE:  -and- yeah, just try to figure out what's best for you and move there.  And then you-
0:03:57.6 0:03:58.1 [horn]
0:03:58.3 0:04:00.2 MALE:  You don't like it, just move somewhere else. 
0:04:00.4 0:04:01.0 FEMALE:  Okay.
0:04:01.2 0:04:02.7 MALE:  Okay so I think they already- 
0:04:03.3 0:04:04.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So I guess you rotate and then-  
0:04:04.5 0:04:06.3 MALE:  Okay.  Nice to meet you.
0:04:05.4 0:04:06.2 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
