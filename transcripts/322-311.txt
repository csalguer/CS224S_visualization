0:00:00.5  0:00:02.7  FEMALE:  Oh man, almost done.
0:00:03.2  0:00:05.9  MALE:  Oh yeah, already. Have you ever done this before?
0:00:06.2  0:00:06.8  FEMALE:  No I haven't.
0:00:06.8  0:00:10.6  MALE:  Really? I haven't either. I just did it out of a whim It is sort of interesting. 
0:00:10.7  0:00:11.2  FEMALE:  Yeah. Yeah.  I like it. It's been fun. 
0:00:11.7  0:00:12.4  MALE:  It's sorrt of a little crazy.
0:00:12.9  0:00:13.1  FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:00:13.6  0:00:15.6  MALE:  So what do you, what do you study?
0:00:16.1  0:00:16.4  FEMALE:  I am in the school of education.
0:00:16.9  0:00:17.3  MALE:  Oh, you are?  Okay. 
0:00:17.3  0:00:20.2  FEMALE:  And I am working on being a math teacher next year. 
0:00:20.7  0:00:21.5  MALE:  Really? Wow. 
0:00:21.8  0:00:22.0  FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:00:22.0  0:00:23.1  MALE:  Were you an undergraduate in math? 
0:00:22.4  0:00:23.6  FEMALE:  I did undergraduate in math.
0:00:24.7  0:00:25.1  MALE:  Okay. 
0:00:25.6  0:00:28.7  FEMALE:  I took a couple of years to work for a non profit in New York City.
0:00:28.8  0:00:30.5  MALE:  Oh really? What, what, what non-profit?  what kind? 
0:00:31.0  0:00:39.6  FEMALE:  It was a -- it was a social services agency. They -- I was working in a development.  I was writing grants and researching grants. 
0:00:39.6  0:00:41.9  MALE:  Wow. I did a lot of work with non-profits before school. 
0:00:42.4  0:00:43.2  FEMALE:  [unintelligible] some programs -- Oh you did?
0:00:43.2  0:00:44.9  MALE:  Yeah.  I love non-profits. 
0:00:45.4  0:00:53.1  FEMALE:  Yeah, I am really interested in [unintelligible] of political and social, you know, implications of math education.  So that's why I am -- Why I am studying for that.
0:00:53.1  0:00:57.7  MALE:  Yeah, in terms of -- like in terms of what are about it?  Is it like...? 
0:00:58.2  0:01:10.1  FEMALE:  I don't know just making -- just you know, who, who is math accessible to you?  What students are challenged?  How do we teach it so that different types of students can learn it?
0:01:10.1  0:01:11.0  MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
0:01:11.5  0:01:15.4  FEMALE:  Because, you know, later in life, it -- I mean it really does become sort of a gate keeper--
0:01:15.4  0:01:15.7  MALE:  [interposing] oh, I totally agree.
0:01:16.2  0:01:19.4  FEMALE:  --or college and for different -- different jobs.  
0:01:19.5  0:01:19.7  MALE:  Flying everywhere.
0:01:20.2  0:01:20.9  FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:01:21.1  0:01:29.1  MALE:  Is there -- I, even like--I am in engineering now  I did [unintelligible] in both -- in both areas, there is. . .
0:01:29.6  0:01:30.1  FEMALE:  Uh huh. Wow.
0:01:30.1  0:01:30.5  MALE:  Men out [unintelligible]--
0:01:31.0  0:01:31.8  FEMALE:  [interposing] Right.  Yes.
0:01:32.3  0:01:39.8  MALE:  And, it's not, you know, unheard of to think the Why is probably because the educational resources are completely bias.
0:01:39.9  0:01:40.3  FEMALE:  Yeah. 
0:01:40.3  0:01:52.4  MALE:  It's amazing even when you see it in class.  You're like, hey, she's got her hand up for like, you know, the past five questions and you were like...  It blows my mind.  I don't know if it's just a generational think.  Probably not. 
0:01:52.9  0:01:59.3  FEMALE:  I think that, well, I mean, you know, as a general -- generational thing, it does get passed down to the next generation.
0:01:59.8  0:02:00.0  MALE:  That's true. 
0:02:00.4  0:02:13.9  FEMALE:  So, I mean -- I mean, you know, you certainly encounter people of older gener -- you know, my grandparents age and stuff, who have certain biases.  And you know, maybe they left in the following generations, but they are still there.
0:02:13.9  0:02:14.2  MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
0:02:14.7  0:02:20.0  FEMALE:  They are still at the core and they are still, you know, structured into Our educational system, our political system.
0:02:20.1  0:02:21.3  MALE:  Yeah, it sort of is a learned behavior probably.
0:02:21.8  0:02:22.4  FEMALE:  Absolutely. I think so.
0:02:22.9  0:02:23.8  MALE:  I think you are probably right.
0:02:24.3  0:02:30.4  FEMALE:  Yeah, and also how we choose to teach mathematics, really caters to a certain type of learner.
0:02:29.9  0:02:30.3  MALE:  Really?
0:02:30.8  0:02:36.4  FEMALE:  It doesn't, it doesn't allow for different---I don't think it allows for all different types of learners to learn math.
0:02:36.9  0:02:37.8  MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
0:02:38.3  0:02:44.1  FEMALE:  In the same way that, that other subjects have,  I guess have.  Anyways, what do you, what do you do?
0:02:44.1  0:02:50.2  MALE:  I, I, I am currently studing in electrical engineering getting masters.  I actually work part time as well. 
0:02:50.2  0:02:50.3  FEMALE:  Uh huh.
0:02:50.3  0:02:52.8  MALE:  And, I did an MBA.
0:02:52.8  0:02:54.2  FEMALE:  Um-hmm. 
0:02:54.2  0:02:55.5  MALE:  So it is not really 100% sure what I'm going to be doing. 
0:02:55.5  0:02:56.1  FEMALE:  Right. 
0:02:56.1  0:03:04.9  MALE:   You know, like uni.  But, but, I don't know, who is.  I sort of like feel like, you know, I don't want to answer that question.  What do you want to do when you grow up?  It's like I don't want to grow up.  
0:03:04.9  0:03:06.4  FEMALE:  Right.  Old.  You [unintelligible].  
0:03:06.4  0:03:11.9  MALE:   Exactly.  I wish I actually too more math.  I tell you.  Because my undergraduate wasn't in engineering. 
0:03:11.9  0:03:13.1  FEMALE:  What was your undergrad in? 
0:03:13.1  0:03:14.2  MALE:  It was in economics.
0:03:14.2  0:03:14.7  FEMALE:  Ah.  
0:03:14.7  0:03:15.7  MALE:  And so...
0:03:15.7  0:03:17.1  FEMALE:   [unintelligible] really [unintelligible]
0:03:17.1  0:03:17.6  MALE: Oh really? 
0:03:17.6  0:03:17.8  FEMALE:  Yes. 
0:03:17.9  0:03:24.7  MALE:  So when I, yeah, when I applied for engineering school, they laughed at me.  They were like, There's no way you're going to get in.
0:03:25.2  0:03:25.8  FEMALE:  Really? 
0:03:25.8  0:03:29.7  MALE:  You don't have the background.  You're not an engineer.  You are so delusional. You are [unintelligible].
0:03:30.2  0:03:30.6  FEMALE:  Right. 
0:03:30.1  0:03:40.9  MALE:  But you know, they were like that.  And I was like you're just pissing me off.  You know, when someone says you can't do something it's like, you know, someone--and I was like, forget it.  I'm going to apply just for spite. 
0:03:41.4  0:03:44.1  FEMALE:  Good for you.  I mean, that's a, that's a, that's a strong character.
0:03:44.6  0:03:46.5  MALE:  Yeah, but now I would like to have, like, things like more math.
0:03:47.0  0:03:47.3  FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:03:47.3  0:03:51.0  MALE:  Because, you know, people are talking about [unintelligible], and have no idea what the heck they are talking about.
0:03:51.0  0:03:51.3  FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
0:03:51.8  0:03:59.5  MALE:  So uni.  How do you say it again.  How do you spell it?  It is pretty brutal.  So I, I, I am the guy that always askd the stupid questions.
0:04:00.0  0:04:02.2  FEMALE:  Hey, they are not stupid questions.
0:04:02.2  0:04:02.6  MALE:  Yeah, they probably are. 
0:04:03.1  0:04:04.4  FEMALE:  You know there is five other people that don't know the answer.
0:04:04.9  0:04:05.1  MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah
0:04:05.6  0:04:05.9  FEMALE:
0:04:06.4  0:04:11.3  MALE:  Yeah, I think I am the guy that they like to ignore.  I could be a perfect [unintelligible].  It was nice meeting you. 
0:04:11.8  0:04:14.4  FEMALE:  Good to meet you.
