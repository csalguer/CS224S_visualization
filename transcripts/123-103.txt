0:07 0:07 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:08 0:09 FEMALE:  You're in business school.
0:09 0:10 MALE:  I am in business school.  How do you know that?
0:10 0:12 FEMALE:  You look like a B-school person.  I'm [unintelligible].
0:13 0:13 MALE:  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
0:14 0:24 FEMALE:  I feel like I can be [unintelligible] since I was [unintelligible], somewhat meaning like humanities or sciences.  But you definitely look like a B-school person.  I would have guessed law school, but I know you're not in the law school.
0:24 0:27 MALE:  Okay.  [unintelligible].  Makes sense [unintelligible].
0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  That's right.  That's right.
0:28 0:28 MALE:  What year are you there?
0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  First year.
0:29 0:30 MALE:  First year?  Okay.  What do you want to do afterwards?
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  That's a good question.
0:32 0:32 MALE:  Okay.
0:33 0:33 FEMALE:  I don't know.
0:33 0:35 MALE:  Not a [unintelligible] type of law, whatever?
0:35 0:43 FEMALE:  Um, I either want to, uh, work for the government, in the Department of Justice, or I was thinking about, um, going into academia.
0:44 0:46 MALE:  Okay.  [unintelligible] military law enforcement, actually for like seven years.
0:47 0:47 FEMALE:  Oh really?
0:47 0:47 MALE:  Yeah.
0:48 0:48 FEMALE:  What is that?
0:48 0:52 MALE:  It's a--it's in the Airforce.  I was a law enforcement officer, anti-terrorism, law enforcement stuff.
0:53 0:53 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  How do you--
0:53 0:55 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  How did you transfer this into a business school?
0:56 0:58 MALE:  I didn't want to do it anymore.  It was a good transition into business world.
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  What kind of stuff did you do?
1:00 1:20 MALE:  Um, a lot of anti-terrorism stuff, especially after 9/11, um, and a lot of it was just base security like base law enforcement [unintelligible] a murder happens on base all the way to, you know, just petty theft crime stuff, so, uh.  But yeah, it was kind of--it was fun.  It was interesting.  It's a good [unintelligible] career to have, you know, [unintelligible] a lot of travel.
1:20 1:23 FEMALE:  So what do you do at the business school?  Does that at all apply to--
1:23 1:30 MALE:  None.  [unintelligible] I'm done.  [unintelligible].
1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  Oh wow.
1:30 1:30 MALE:  So where you from?
1:32 1:32 FEMALE:  Ohio.
1:32 1:33 MALE:  Ohio.  Okay.
1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:34 1:34 MALE:  Did you [unintelligible] the West Coast?
1:35 1:37 FEMALE:  No, actually I was down in grad school at UCLA.
1:37 1:37 MALE:  Okay.
1:38 1:39 FEMALE:  So I've been out in California for a few [unintelligible].
1:39 1:41 MALE:  [unintelligible] to grad school; and now you're going to [unintelligible].
1:41 1:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I--well, you know, I was technically in a PHD program, but I quit after two years 'cause it was too hard.  So I got my masters.  I'm like, I'm not smart enough for a philosophy program.  So I got out.
1:52 1:57 MALE:  Sure.  [unintelligible] what Stanford Law [unintelligible] [laughter].
1:55 2:01 FEMALE:  You know, [unintelligible] university, but that's not really what happened [laughter].
2:03 2:03 MALE:  Sure.
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  You know, I'd have--
2:04 2:08 MALE:  I have a question for you.  What are you looking for, like, five, ten years down the road [unintelligible], or are you looking...
2:08 2:11 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  That's a really hard question.
2:10 2:11 MALE:  Have you thought [unintelligible]?
2:11 2:25 FEMALE:  Um, I really don't know.  Whatever happens, happens?  It's not something that I--I mean, I know a lot of women really want to have these goals in their mind.  But I feel like if you do something like that, then you just end up getting frustrated, disappointing, or forcing things in a relationship that necessarily might not work, so.
2:26 2:26 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:26 2:30 FEMALE:  I'm just kind of--I mean, hopefully by 35, I'll have my first kid.  Otherwise, [unintelligible] is an OB Gyn.
2:31 2:31 MALE:  Okay.
2:31 2:34 FEMALE:  So she always likes to give me statistics about like birth defects as women get older.
2:35 2:35 MALE:  Older.  Okay.
2:35 2:39 FEMALE:  And so, I mean, the only thing I know is like you're supposed to have your first kid before 35.
2:39 2:40 MALE:  Okay.  Well that's a goal, at least.
2:41 2:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, I guess.  That's sort of a very vague goal.  But I'm also open to adoption.  So I could be like 50 and adopt a kid.  How about yourself?
2:50 3:02 MALE:  Uh yeah, definitely [unintelligible].  [unintelligible] rushing anything, [unintelligible], you know, kind of want a stabilized career [unintelligible].  Yeah, definitely I wanted kind of the 2.5 kids kind of thing.  And so--
3:02 3:04 FEMALE:  How do you cut that one in half [laughter]?
3:04 3:07 MALE:  I don't know.  [laughter] [unintelligible] so you figure you've got to be able to do it somehow.
3:08 3:11 FEMALE:  Right, right.  Or you could have, like, one normal kid that had a Siamese twin, and [unintelligible], you know.
3:11 3:12 MALE:  True, exactly.
3:13 3:13 FEMALE:  Right.
3:14 3:19 MALE:  But yeah, I do want that to become a part of my life.  So whenever that happens or however it happens, [unintelligible] not rushing it.
3:19 3:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:20 3:21 MALE:  What do you do for fun around here?
3:22 3:39 FEMALE:  Wow.  I'm a first year law student, and unlike the B school, I mean, you know, there are a couple of people on the B school at the Law School, and they tell me you guys work on projects.  You guys don't have grades, like it's some kind of path that you guys have.  And you guys party all the time.  [unintelligible] and you guys all take a weekend trip somewhere I don't understand.
3:39 3:41 MALE:  Vegas night on Tuesday night, yeah.
3:41 3:51 FEMALE:  With--we at the Law School, you know, we have grades.  We're on an average, like a curve.  We work hard.  It's competitive.  So--
3:51 3:51 MALE:  No fun.
3:52 3:52 FEMALE:  No fun yet.
3:53 3:53 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:54 3:54 FEMALE:  Really?
3:55 3:55 MALE:  Yeah.
3:55 3:57 FEMALE:  'Cause I see a lot of people from the library.
3:57 4:00 MALE:  Really?  Yeah?  [unintelligible] study, but, yeah, from what I hear.
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Oh do you know a lot of the law students?
4:02 4:03 MALE:  I know a couple.  I know, uh--
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  Oh, who do you know?
4:04 4:05 MALE:  [unintelligible], he's friends with--
4:05 4:07 FEMALE:  Oh my God, he's in my freshman [unintelligible].  How do you know [unintelligible]?
4:07 4:08 MALE:  I know [unintelligible].
4:09 4:10 FEMALE:  That's crazy.
4:11 4:13 MALE:  [unintelligible].  female123, it was good to meet you.  [unintelligible].  All right.
4:13  4:13 FEMALE:  Thanks.
4:13  4:13 MALE:  Take care.
