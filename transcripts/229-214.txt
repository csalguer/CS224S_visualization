0:25 0:26 MALE:  Okay.
0:26 0:28 FEMALE:  So tell me about Houston.
0:28 0:39 MALE:  Houston's really nice.  I once [unintelligible] Pittsburgh [unintelligible] and then I worked in Cincinnati for three years.  I worked for Proctor & Gamble on Crest.
0:39 0:40 FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:40 0:41 MALE:  Toothbrushes and toothpaste you use.
0:41 0:46 FEMALE:  My cousin, he works actually now for Proctor & Gamble in China.
0:46 0:46 MALE:  Really?
0:46 0:50 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.  My entire extended family lives in Cincinnati.
0:49 0:50 MALE:  Wow.
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.
0:50 0:51 MALE:  It's an nice place to be.
0:52 1:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's very pleasant.  It works.  But I actually grew up here in San Jose.  So my parents were the big departure.
1:00 1:01 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:01 1:03 FEMALE: The crazy kids that moved out west, so.
1:04 1:09 MALE:  Yeah, I like this place much better then Cincinnati.  There's a lot more culture and it's bigger.
1:10 1:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Cincinnati thinks they have culture.
1:14 1:19 MALE:  It's a nice place to live, unless you go outside and see there's a lot more out there.
1:20 1:24 FEMALE:  There you go.  There you go.  So, um, how long have you been at Stanford?
1:24 1:31 MALE:  I've been here for two years, and I'm finishing my degree in mechanical engineering and I'm starting a degree in aerospace, so I'll be here for another two years.
1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Back to back.
1:34 1:35 MALE:  I like it here.  I don't want to leave.
1:35 1:36 FEMALE: Clearly.
1:36 1:37 MALE:  What do you do?
1:36 1:42 FEMALE:  I'm actually a masters student, one year, in the school of education.
1:43 1:45 MALE:  One year.  So you must be taking a crazy amount of units.
1:44 2:14 FEMALE:  It's insane and an internship and a masters project.  So, yeah, it's pretty crazy.  Um, but I'm out of here in June and I gotta admit this place grows on you, you know.  It's a little bit ironic, you know, a year just simply isn't enough time.  But if it had been any longer I wouldn't have come back to school, you know, 'cause I'm thinking yeah, this is cool, quick in, quick out, back to life.  But now, it's you know, it is nice here, it's comfortable.
2:15 2:16 MALE:  What do you hope to do after graduation?
2:17 2:18 FEMALE:  Um -
2:18 2:19 MALE:  You said you have an internship so you got something.
2:21 2:36 FEMALE:  Right.  Well, that's actually just for the school year, so um, yeah, we have to do an internship and fifteen -- like about fifteen units a quarter and a masters project.  It's very intense.  So um, yeah, kind of bopping around.  I worked before I came to school so.
2:36 2:37 MALE:  Where did you work?
2:37 2:57 FEMALE:  I worked in New York City and I worked -- my last job I worked in financial but l was like in their IT department, I managed the application development department.  And before that I was in you know, [unintelligible] in new media and um, flash websites, that kind of stuff.
2:58 2:59 MALE:  What kind of music do you like?
2:59 3:10 FEMALE:  What kind of music do I like?  Hip-hop is my first live, um, but yeah, I like all kinds of stuff, you know, cheesy '80' and um -
3:10 3:10 MALE:  I like '80's and dance.
3:12 3:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, dance music too.  I like house.
3:15 3:16 MALE:  [unintelligible].
3:17 3:25 FEMALE:  I'm -- I'm okay with techno.  I have a lot of friends that are big techno heads.
3:25 3:27 MALE:  I like dance music more then techno, actually.
3:27 3:29 FEMALE:  Yeah, I gotta say me too.
3:29 3:30 MALE:  I mean, they're similar, they have similarities.
3:32 3:44 FEMALE:  It's like trans or like whatever, there's a lot of techno that you can like finally bust out to but yeah, you know, club music, whatever.  I like to go out and dance a lot, so, have a good time.  [laughter].
3:44 3:45 MALE:  Cool.  How was your day today?
3:46 3:54 FEMALE:  My day today, um, exhausting actually.  My masters project expo is in about ten days.
3:56 3:56 MALE:  Oh, wow [unintelligible].
3:56 4:09 FEMALE:  So it's been a lot of long days and nights, you know, holed up, plowing through stuff, and developing a curriculum and that kind of stuff, so a little bit tiring.  But I'm glad I made it out tonight.
4:10 4:11 MALE:  [unintelligible].
