0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Hi [unintelligible].

0:03 0:03 MALE:  Hi.  Give me a second. 

0:07 0:31 FEMALE:  Take your time.  Gut feeling.

0:11 0:13 MALE:  Yeah, I know.  It's a lot of scribbling.

0:38 0:42 FEMALE:  How do you--how do you rate other people about their--whether they're being courteous or not?

0:22 0:27 MALE:  That's like whether or not they ask questions about you actually.  Which station is this by the way?

0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  What?

0:28 0:28 MALE:  This is?

0:50 0:53 FEMALE:  Q.  It's like how--how do you rate it like just [unintelligible]?

0:29 0:34 MALE:  Q.  Yeah it's tough.

0:55 1:02 FEMALE:  And actually there are a lot--I wish they had like not available or not decided 'cause there are so many [unintelligible] I don't know.  In two minutes, four minutes.

0:41 0:46 MALE:  Yeah, I mean, how has it been going so far?  Have you found--have you [unintelligible].

1:07 1:08 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] find what?

0:47 0:48 MALE:  Have you found the one yet?

1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] what?

0:50 0:51 MALE:  Have you found Mr. Right?  [laughter].

1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  Of course not, have you?

0:54 0:54 MALE:  I don't know.

1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] nice and friendly.

0:58 1:04 MALE:  This--this girl over here [unintelligible].

1:25 1:31 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, you--you have to go [unintelligible] here [unintelligible].  [laughter].  And, um, [unintelligible] what school are you in and usually--

1:10 1:10 MALE:  What's that?

1:31 1:37 FEMALE:  --and usually people are all, oh, what school are you in, are you a Ph.D., [unintelligible] by the--by the time [unintelligible] I'm a post doc.  So, I don't know whether that really [unintelligible].

1:16 1:22 MALE:  Oh, oh.  Yeah, well, yeah if you say you're a post doc that's okay no one has said anything but it's not uncommon right?

1:42 1:52 FEMALE:  No, but then I think [unintelligible] like for me [unintelligible] how--how [unintelligible] my age, myself.  But I don't really--I don't lie.

1:30 1:30 MALE:  Right, right.

1:57 2:01 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] nothing to lose.

1:32 1:35 MALE:  That's fine because this isn't [unintelligible].  I mean [unintelligible].

2:01 2:03 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] to talk to--

1:40 1:48 MALE:  Right, exactly.  It's just--I think it's just good for you because at the stage you're in you need to kind of like get some exposure, break out of your shell, a little-- 

2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].

1:50 1:51 MALE:  Oh, [unintelligible].  Okay.

2:12 2:16 FEMALE:  No [unintelligible].  Yeah, I figure, well, okay, well, I don't want to lie from the first time we meet.

1:54 1:57 MALE:  I totally forgot that it was [unintelligible].

2:19 2:20 FEMALE:  I don't think they'll listen to [unintelligible].

2:00 2:04 MALE:  I'm--I'm--I'm speaking [unintelligible].  [laughter].

2:25 2:29 FEMALE:  So, how do you find it so far?  Have you met any interesting people?

2:06 2:16 MALE:  Oh, it's fun, I mean, whatever.  I mean, if I can get--if I can get [unintelligible] to people [unintelligible] that's a success.  That's why [unintelligible].

2:37 2:40 FEMALE:  I think people [unintelligible] like [unintelligible], right?

2:20 2:21 MALE:  That's just--it's just--I mean, you know.

2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  Polite or not they would do it.

2:23 2:23 MALE:  Huh?

2:44 2:51 FEMALE:  I think nobody wants to be awkward, so I think everybody who has tried to [unintelligible].  What do you talk about?  What do you talk about?

2:30 2:30 MALE:  Huh?

2:52 2:54 FEMALE:  What do you talk about usually?  How do you break the ice?

2:36 2:37 MALE:  Say--I'll say, well--

2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  Do you ask them--

2:38 3:12 MALE:  --I don't know.  It just really depends upon the--what's my strategy.  I play it by ear because basically two of the people [unintelligible] well two of the people they're almost like medicalish people, so I didn't, uh, [unintelligible] come up with questions related to [unintelligible] trying to just figure out what they do [unintelligible] how I know somebody or something in that area.  [unintelligible] and something so I [unintelligible] about their expertise and so forth.  So, then once they can start talking and then they'll feel better [unintelligible].  [unintelligible] just like [unintelligible].  Okay.  How can I make you talk some more, so the goal is to keep them talking as much as possible.

3:33 3:39 FEMALE:  I think for the girls they would want to hear the guys talking too 'cause [unintelligible] the judge [unintelligible] intelligent or [unintelligible].

3:17 3:28 MALE:  True, true.  But the thing is if you end a conversation with them having spoken 70 and you having spoken 30, but you're 30 is entirely asking me questions and you're interested then they feel that [unintelligible].
 
3:50 3:55 FEMALE:  Okay.  Oh, I guess so far I would say 50/50 [unintelligible] ask [unintelligible] so.

3:34 3:40 MALE:  I mean, yeah, 'cause if--if you actually have true rapport right then, if, you know, if there's--oh, okay.

3:57 4:05 FEMALE:  It's only four minutes.  Well, okay, well.  Do we really have to fill out some forms?  Can we just skip this [unintelligible]?

3:43 3:46 MALE:  Uh, yeah, I mean, I think we do.

4:08 4:10 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, I will.
