0:00 0:03 FEMALE: Do you notice how you--how they say the date's name's optional?
0:01 0:02 MALE: I know. 
0:03 0:04 FEMALE: I mean, come on. [laughter] 
0:03 0:03 MALE: Come on.  
0:05 0:05 FEMALE: What's up with that?
0:04 0:05 MALE: That is a little problematic.  
0:06 0:07 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:06 0:07 MALE: All right.  So how's it been going?  Have you been enjoying it?
0:09 0:10 FEMALE: Yeah. This is interesting, actually. 
0:10 0:11 MALE: Have you ever done, like--
0:13 0:17 FEMALE: No, I've never done this.  Um, I saw a flyer at--my friend lives at Escondido Village.
0:16 0:16 MALE: Oh, cool.
0:18 0:24 FEMALE: Um, and there was a flyer there, and she was dating someone.  She was like, "Oh, here, do you want this?"  I was like, "Sure, why not?  Give it a try." You know?
0:21 0:26 MALE:  That's fun.  Yeah. I did, um--well, I guess the Grad Student Council organized some, so I did one before and --
0:28 0:29 FEMALE: Oh, I heard about that. 
0:27 0:30 MALE: I mean, the whole thing's totally bizarre, but it's kind of fun. 
0:32 0:32 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:30 0:33 MALE: And I don't--I mean, I don't really meet many people outside law school, so--
0:35 0:36 FEMALE: Yeah, it's hard to.
0:34 0:37 MALE: Do you--have you been pretty focused in your subject?
0:39 0:39 FEMALE: Yeah. 
0:37 0:39 MALE: I, I actually didn't catch what--what are you studying?
0:41 0:54 FEMALE: Immunology, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, the medical school has, like--oh, I would say, like 15 different disciplines, so there's a lot of graduate students over there.  Um, so I guess it's pretty hard to, to get outside of our--
0:51 0:55 MALE: Do you get to know the other PhD students there, or not even?
0:57 1:01 FEMALE: Yeah, we have classes with a lot of them, and then they have social hours that they sponsor.
1:00 1:00 MALE: That's sweet.
1:02 1:08 FEMALE: Department sponsors social hours, and then lots of parties that they throw over there, so--and you meet a lot of people everywhere. 
1:07 1:17 MALE: No, that's not bad at all. I remember, like, under grad, you hear about, like, how bad social life is for grad students here.  I think it's either dramatically improved or those reports were badly mistaken. 
1:19 1:27 FEMALE: Well, I think some of it is initiated by the graduate students.  Like, immunology program, they've got a lot of leaders in terms of initiating activities like that. 
1:26 1:26 MALE: That's cool.
1:28 1:33 FEMALE: And so they've--I think that because the graduate students have been more outgoing and social, it's really stepped it up a bit. 
1:32 1:36 MALE: As long as someone's willing to do the heavy lifting.  What's your, uh, area of focus within immunologies?
1:38 1:41 FEMALE: Well, actually, I'm studying the development of the immune system.
1:40 1:40 MALE: That's [unintelligible].
1:42 1:53 FEMALE: How the immune system decides between what is yourself and what is not yourself.  So it doesn't attack yourself.  Like, it takes care of the flu, but it doesn't kick out your pancreas so you get diabetes, that sort of thing. 
1:52 1:54 MALE: That is a really important area of study.
1:56 1:57 FEMALE: It is.  I'm r--I'm really excited about it. 
1:55 1:59 MALE: Is there a particular, like, disease or autoimmune problem that you're focusing on?
2:01 2:13 FEMALE: Um, no.  I'm just focusing on the basic science of how it develops and how it figures out that decision when it trains itself, whether, um, it's looking at foreign tissue or, um, yourself. 
2:11 2:19 MALE: God, I, I, I wish we had longer because I, I'd be really interested in, uh--but it'd probably be totally over my head working off of a high school biology level. 
2:18 2:22 FEMALE: It's a bit--it's really not.  I mean, it, it's a really cool--it's a really cool field. 
2:21 2:24 MALE: What, what do you think comes after this?  Are you thinking about teaching or--
2:26 2:28 FEMALE: Actually, I've been trying to figure that out this year, and I think [unintelligible]--
2:27 2:29 MALE: I don't mean to add stress or anything.  I'm just always curious. 
2:30 2:44 FEMALE: No, it, it's really good, actually, to figure out what you want to do, and mainly, that's what graduate school's for, is to figure out if you want to do research or whether you want to go off and do some sort of an industry-related or, for instance, patent law.  A lot of the, the--
2:42 2:43 MALE: It totally makes sense.  Yeah. 
2:45 2:56 FEMALE: PhDs do patent law.  Um, I think I'll, I'll do a post-doc, so, uh, I'll research for a couple of years after I get my PhD, and then go and do a consulting-type of business. 
2:55 2:56 MALE: Oh, that's pretty cool.
2:57 2:58 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:56 2:58 MALE: For pharmaceutical companies, or--
3:00 3:12 FEMALE: Right.  Something like that.  I think what they do is, is they try and help pharmaceutical companies decide what drugs to invest in or what avenues to pursue.  I'm not quite positive about that. 
3:08 3:16 MALE: That's a--you know, especially because it seems to me, like, "Okay.  Yeah.  It could be lucrative," which would be great, but, I mean, it's such a practical application of what you're in to.
3:18 3:19 FEMALE: Right. And then--
3:17 3:18 MALE: Wow.  You're saving lives.  That's awesome. 
3:20 3:24 FEMALE: It's a lot of diversity, and there's a traveling factor in it.  I like to travel a lot. 
3:22 3:27 MALE: I would like that, too.  I mean, a lot of people complain about consulting, but I wouldn't be one of them. 
3:29 3:31 FEMALE: I mean, if you do it for a couple years.
3:29 3:30 MALE: Yeah. 
3:31 3:34 FEMALE: And then you decide you want to do something else, there's no harm in that. 
3:31 3:36 MALE: Did you think about that as a potential line of work when you first came here, or this is something that's kind of developed since?
3:38 3:45 FEMALE: It's actually kind of developed since I got here, just hearing about the different options and exploring what I could do with my PhD.  Yeah. 
3:44 3:45 MALE: That's cool.  That's very cool. 
3:47 3:49 FEMALE: What about yourself?  What kind of law are you studying?
3:47 3:49 MALE: I'm really interested in criminal law. 
3:51 3:51 FEMALE: Oh, yeah. 
3:49 3:51 MALE: My, my dream, long-term, I'd love to be a trail-court judge. 
3:53 3:55 FEMALE: Trial court.  That's cool.  So it'd be exciting. 
3:51 4:09 MALE: Um, so, very exciting, like, you know, really, kind of, interesting work.  Um, but that's, like, way out, so, uh, I'm probably, like, federal prosecutor for a while, work in private practice for a bit.  Um, but at the same time, I don't know if you're going through this every month, my interests change, too.
4:11 4:13 FEMALE: Yeah, I, I, I understand exactly. 
4:09 4:16 MALE: So this is the plan for now.  We should check in, and, you know, it'll be  completely different.  It was really good to meet you, then. 
4:17 4:18 FEMALE: It was good to meet you. 
4:16 4:19 MALE: That's really cool.  I'm sorry.  This was--
4:21 4:21 FEMALE: N.
4:20 4:20 MALE: N?
4:22 4:22 FEMALE: Yeah.
