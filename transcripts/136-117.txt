0:00 0:06 MALE:  Oh, one more.  Sorry, I thought that was it.  Hey, how's it going?  
0:02 0:03 FEMALE:  It's going well.  How about you?  
0:10 0:13 MALE:  This is the last one.  I was thinking that was the last one, and then I was like, wait, everyone else moved.  So...
0:09 0:09 FEMALE:  I'm female136.  
0:15 0:20 MALE:  I'm male117.  It's good to meet you, female136.  So, tell me about yourself a little bit.  
0:15 0:18 FEMALE:  Well, I'm in the law school.  Are you in the law school?  
0:23 0:24 MALE:  Yeah, I am actually.  
0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  I thought I recognized you.  
0:26 0:26 MALE:  Did you, okay.  
0:22 0:23 FEMALE:  Yeah. What year are you?  
0:28 0:29 MALE:  I'm a third year.  
0:24 0:24 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
0:30 0:31 MALE:  Yeah, what about you?  
0:26 0:27 FEMALE:  I'm a first year.  
0:32 0:32 MALE:  First year, how's it going?  
0:28 0:30 FEMALE:  It's going well.  
0:35 0:35 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:31 0:37 FEMALE:  I like it a little [unintelligible].  That [unintelligible] that I wasn't sure that I was going to like law school.  I really like it.  
0:42 0:50 MALE:  Good. That's good.  I like law school too.  I mean it's--you've got to study. I mean first year especially you've just got to study.  
0:46 0:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, but it's getting really hard to study with the weather.  
0:55 1:06 MALE:  I know.  That's why you're here so.  Where are you from?  I'm from Illinois, the Chicago area.  
1:02 1:05 FEMALE: Yeah, so do you [unintelligible] or are you going back there?  
1:11 1:34 MALE:  I do miss it actually.  I was going to stay out here, and then I decided to go back just recently actually. So, I had all this family stuff going on where it's like, you know, I better get back to Chicago.  Because I had taken a job at Morrison's [unintelligible] out here, and then I said, okay, sorry.  I've got to go back to Chicago.  They weren't too happy, but I realize I just had to do it.  So...
1:30 1:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:35 1:42 MALE:  But I love it out here. It's so nice.  Enjoy every minute of it.  Seriously.  Just enjoy it.  
1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:42 1:44 MALE:  Are you planning to go back to DC when you're done?  
1:40 1:41 FEMALE:  After graduation?  
1:46 1:46 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:42 1:48 FEMALE:  Probably--I haven't--I'm really interested in [unintelligible] public international law. 
1:53 1:53 MALE:  Okay.  
1:49 1:51 FEMALE:  And there's pretty much none of that out here.  
1:57 1:58 MALE:  Yeah.  No, it's all--
1:55 2:10 FEMALE:  [interposing]  And even [unintelligible].  Unless you're really [unintelligible] they've actually worked with companies that [unintelligible].  It's not really my--you know, I'm really more interested in [unintelligible] law and diplomacy, more of the--
2:15 2:18 MALE:  [interposing]  Okay, so do you want to work for the State Department?  
2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
2:19 2:22 MALE:  Ideally, okay.  What are you doing this summer?  
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  I'm working for the Commerce Department.  
2:26 2:26 MALE:  Okay.  
2:21 2:23 FEMALE:  So, somewhat related.  
2:28 2:29 MALE:  Close, yeah.  
2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:30 2:30 MALE:  Cool.  
2:25 2:26 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, what are you like--what is your major [unintelligible] for a year?  
2:44 2:53 MALE:  Major recommendations?  Well, after first year I would just say--well, for me. It's hard for me to say because for me I would say I would do clinic.  
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:54 3:23 MALE:  It's really--I just think it doesn't feel like work, and that's kind of--I did the education clinic, and I did the advanced education clinic.  I didn't do any other clinics.  My second year I didn't do clinic, but I wish I had done--like, I'm like, ah, I would have liked to do the community law clinic.  I did the volunteer clinic back in [unintelligible].  I don't know.  That would probably be my main one and just enjoy your time out here. 
3:18 3:18 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:23 3:36 MALE:  I would say that.  Just, you know, go hiking, and just--you know, get an apartment with a pool.  That's what I did last summer.  I was so happy because I lived on campus.  What about--do you live on campus now?  
3:31 3:34 FEMALE:  Yeah, I do in Escandita [phonetic] Village.  Are you off campus now?  
3:40 4:01 MALE:  Yeah, I'm at Oak Creek now.  So, actually I lived in Mountain view for a while.  And then I just decided--a place opened up in Oak Creek a couple--like two months ago, and I decided, you know, for my last three months here I'm just going to--it's more expensive.  But [unintelligible], not bad so.  Well, it was good to meet you.  
3:56 3:58 FEMALE:  Good to meet you too.  
4:03 4:04 MALE:  Wait, wait what's your name again?  
3:59 4:02 FEMALE:  female136.  I've been hiding it not intentionally.  
4:08 4:16 MALE:  Good talking to you.  I'll see you.  Make sure you say hi next time if I'm walking by and you see me. And I'll do the same.
