0:00 0:02  FEMALE: I wrote it down right now.
0:02 0:02 MALE: Yeah, yeah.
0:02 0:10 FEMALE:  You'd think I would figure out these questions.  I read them again every time.  I'm like why am I not smart enough to figure this out.
0:10 0:12 MALE:  I'm very ambitious too.  
0:13 0:13 FEMALE:    Okay.
0:13 0:15 MALE:  So make sure you get that right. 
0:15 0:20 FEMALE: Tell me about all the things you want to do with your life and I'll decide if you're ambitious or not.
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Okay.  Okay.  [unintelligible].
0:21 0:24 FEMALE:  I'm female227, nice to meet you.
0:24 0:27 MALE:  male219.  And you're station number?
0:27 0:27 FEMALE:  G.
0:28 0:28 MALE:  G, alright.
0:29 0:33 FEMALE:  Yes, I'm the third or second or fourth business school student that [unintelligible] in a row.
0:33 0:37 MALE:  Well, I'm the fourth or fifth double e [unintelligible].
0:37 0:37 FEMALE:  Exactly [laughter].
0:37 0:39 MALE:  So we're in the same boat here.  You're all friends, correct?
0:39 0:44 FEMALE: I -- they're first year, so we don't actually know -- like first years and second years don't have class together.
0:44 0:44 MALE:  Right.
0:44 0:50 FEMALE:  So I kind of know that they exist, but this is -- but nameX is one of my good friends, so.
0:50 0:50 MALE:  So you're second year?  
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:    I'm a second year.
0:51 0:53 MALE:  Do you know nameX [phonetic].
0:53 0:58 FEMALE:  Actually, that is so funny that you asked that because nameX and I met in D.C. when he was living in D.C.
0:58 0:58 MALE:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:59 1:04 FEMALE:  We both got in and we used to -- we're both not doing any work at our jobs, you know.
1:04 1:04 MALE:  [laughter].
1:04 1:06 FEMALE:  After we found out we got in.
1:06 1:06 MALE:  Right, right.  
1:06 1:10 FEMALE:  We were sliding, so we'd IM each other all day, are you doing work?  No.  Are you doing any work?  No.
1:10 1:11 MALE:  [laughter] that's pretty funny. 
1:12 1:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, he's awesome.  How do you know him?
1:14 1:15 MALE:  He's a pretty good friend of mine actually.
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:16 1:18 MALE:  Um, I'm -- we're -- I'm going to his wedding in uh -
1:18 1:18 FEMALE:   Yeah.
1:18 1:18 MALE:  Yeah. 
1:18 1:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Fun.
1:19 1:22 MALE:  Yeah, so, so we're pretty good friends, yeah.
1:22 1:22 FEMALE:  From?
1:23 1:28 MALE: Um, well, from the past year.  I didn't know him before that [unintelligible].
1:28 1:28 FEMALE:  Oh, so you met him here.
1:28 1:31 MALE:  Well, one of my -- one of his good friends is a friend of mine and [unintelligible].
1:31 1:31 FEMALE:  Oh, okay. 
1:31 1:33 MALE:  So, we hang out a lot. 
1:33 1:33 FEMALE:  It's two degrees of separation. 
1:34 1:34 MALE:  Yeah.
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Or something like that.  
1:35 1:35 MALE:  So where are you from originally?
1:36 1:43 FEMALE:  Um, Minnesota, then Massachusetts, then D.C. and now I live here, obviously.
1:43 1:47 MALE:  So, of all those four places which place is the best?
1:47 1:49 FEMALE:  I like here the best. 
1:49 1:50 MALE:  See, that's the going thing that I've heard tonight.
1:50 1:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, everyone -
1:51 1:52 MALE:  [unintelligible] so.  [laughter].
1:52 1:54 FEMALE:  [laughter].  What about you?
1:54 1:54 MALE:  I'm from Sacramento.
1:55 1:57 FEMALE:  Oh, so you've never left?
1:57 2:00 MALE:  I've never left.  Which is why -
2:00 2:00 FEMALE:  There's a lot -
2:00 2:02 MALE:  Which is why I think I need a change, so I know what I'm missing here.
2:02 2:03 FEMALE:  So you think you want to move somewhere else?
2:03 2:04 MALE:  Just to realize how bad somewhere else can be.
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  [laughter].
2:04 2:05 MALE:  No I -
2:05 2:09   FEMALE:  Maybe you should go to D.C., you'll realize pretty quickly how bad.
2:09 2:12 MALE:  Why D.C.?  Why is D.C. bad?
2:12 2:24 FEMALE:  Uh, I don't know, I mean maybe it's because I was there when Bush was -- like I got there right after Clinton left and Bush and I feel like that really defines like the atmosphere, so it's very conservative and I wasn't in politics -
2:24 2:24 MALE:  Right.
2:24 2:32 FEMALE:  So I was kind of outside of that and yeah, just in the summer it's just so hot and sticky you don't want to be alive.
2:32 2:34 MALE:  So you were in Minnesota and then -
2:34 2:34 FEMALE:  Massachusetts.
2:34 2:35 MALE:  Massachusetts.
2:35 2:36 FEMALE:  Where I went to college.  
2:36 2:37 MALE:  Where'd you go to school?
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  Amherst.
2:37 2:40 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  [unintelligible].
2:41 2:42 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
2:42 2:42 MALE:  [unintelligible].
2:42 2:43 FEMALE:  In [unintelligible].
2:44 2:44 MALE:  Right.  Okay, okay.  
2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, where'd you go to school?
2:46 2:46 MALE:  I went to Berkley undergrad. 
2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  Oh. 
2:47 2:49 MALE:  So I've never left the area.
2:49 2:49 FEMALE:  Really. 
2:49 2:51 MALE:  A little, little hometown boy here.  
2:51 2:55 FEMALE:  How did you make the transition here?  Don't all your Berkley friends hate you now?
2:55 2:59 MALE:  I've been here longer then I have at Berkley, actually.
2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
2:59 3:00 MALE:  But for some reason I can't get it out my head.
3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
3:02 3:04 MALE:  Once a public school person always a public school person.
3:04 3:04 FEMALE:  Uh-mm.
3:05 3:07 MALE:  You know, so it's hard to sell out but -
3:07 3:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, one of -
3:08 3:08 MALE:  I think I've done okay.
3:09 3:15 FEMALE:  Yeah.  One of our roommates graduated from Berkley, so he's always -- he took us up to Berkley two weekends ago, I guess -
3:15 3:15 MALE:  Yes.
3:15 3:17 FEMALE:  To show us around and everything.
3:17 3:20 MALE:  And is he the same [unintelligible] where he can [unintelligible] Stanford, or he's okay with it now?
3:20 3:30 FEMALE:  Um, he's okay, but I definitely think he holds, you know, Berkley in his heart versus Stanford is you know, a good place to be for his business school degree.
3:30 3:30 MALE:  Right, right.  
3:31 3:31 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:31 3:32 MALE:  One is on your resume, one is something -
3:32 3:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:32 3:34 MALE:  That's more a part of you [unintelligible].
3:34 3:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  At least that's the feeling I get.
3:36 3:39 MALE:  Oh.  So what do you do for fun?
3:40 3:53 FEMALE:  Um, I feel like all we do is like sit around and drink wine.  Like, I feel like, people are asking me this, I'm like I'm really not that interesting anymore.  I used to do all this stuff when I worked and now I go to class and sit around and drink wine and.
3:53 3:57 MALE:  So you're saying that's all you do now is just drink wine?  That's great.  I mean, wine's -
3:57 4:03 FEMALE:  I'm trying to think of other things that we do.  I mean we do all this random crap, like -- we just go to a lot of parties.
4:03 4:04 MALE:  Okay.  Well, that's fun, I mean -
4:05 4:11 FEMALE:  Yeah, but it doesn't -- it isn't a very broad interest that I have something interesting to talk about, oh, yeah, we had this party and you know we made -
4:11 4:13 MALE:  You learn about, you know, civilization.
4:13 4:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.
4:14 4:15 MALE:  It was nice meeting you.
4:15 4:16 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
