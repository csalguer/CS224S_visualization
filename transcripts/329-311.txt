0:41 0:43 FEMALE:  Um it means um a thousand mountain spirits.
0:42 0:43 MALE:  A--a thousand mountains?
0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  Spirits.
0:44 0:48 MALE:  Spirits.  Okay.  Is that good or does it mean you have multiple personality disorder?
0:50 0:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, it basically means I'm schizophrenic.
0:50 0:50 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:52 0:54 FEMALE:  And you don't want to trust me for anything.
0:52 0:52 MALE:  Now that could be real--
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  [interposing] Flightily, shifty, you know spirits.  
0:54 0:54 MALE:  That's great.
0:56 0:58 FEMALE:  They're not really very stable.  
0:56 0:56 MALE:  Yeah.
0:58 0:59 FEMALE:  They're bound to just kind of go crazy.
0:57 0:58 MALE:  Awkward, ten--
1:00 1:05 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah, yeah.  Ten um--yeah, I really--not too good.
1:03 1:05 MALE:  Yeah, that's not--so what do you study here?
1:07 1:07 FEMALE:  Um product design.
1:06 1:07 MALE:  Oh, you do.  Oh wow, that's cool.
1:09 1:10 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What do you do?
1:08 1:13 MALE:  So um I did an MBA, and now I'm doing EE, a masters in EE.
1:15 1:15 FEMALE:  Oh wow.
1:14 1:14 MALE:  And I'm working part time, so.
1:17 1:19 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  That's different.  Why are you doing that?
1:17 1:18 MALE:  Why?  Why?
1:20 1:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:19 1:35 MALE:  Well, I'm--I mean, MBA I thought it was a really good degree because it opens lots of doors for you in terms of gives you a good perspective on how businesses work.  And then engineering is--gives you, I think a lot of credibility you need with the people you work with like engineers.  
1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  That's true.
1:35 1:39 MALE:  And, you know, I can't stand it when people talk about stuff--
1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  [interposing] And don't know anything.
1:39 1:39 MALE:  --like in leaders.  
1:42 1:42 FEMALE:  That's true.
1:40 1:49 MALE:  Like you see a CEO and he's like--you know, someone asks him a question and he's just answering totally around--around it, so.  So but product design's pretty cool.
1:52 1:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.
1:50 1:57 MALE:  I've seen some like uh the--I--I went to one of the websites of uh, I guess everyone has their own little website showing their like cool little products and stuff.
1:59 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:58 2:01 MALE:  And like half of you work for--want to work for IDO [phonetic] or something of product design.
2:03 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's just more like there's an incestuous relationship between IDO and the product design department.
2:04 2:04 MALE:  I can imagine.
2:07 2:08 FEMALE:  It's completely incestuous. 
2:07 2:07 MALE:  Wow.
2:09 2:15 FEMALE:  And so by default, people go to IDO because it's a good job and it's kind of you don't know what to do.  It's kind of like, you know, consulting on a college.  Everyone goes people--
2:13 2:13 MALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
2:16 2:17 FEMALE:  --think you don't have anything to do.  Same thing.
2:15 2:17 MALE:  Well, so I--it has a great reputation.
2:19 2:21 FEMALE:  Oh yeah, it has an amazing reputation, so.
2:19 2:20 MALE:  So what are you planning?  Are you planning to do--
2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  [interposing] Not going to IDO.
2:21 2:21 MALE:  Okay.
2:23 2:24 FEMALE:  That's one thing for sure.
2:23 2:24 MALE:  Where do you want to go?
2:26 2:28 FEMALE:  Um I'm going to--well, I'm working for Pottery Barn this summer.
2:27 2:27 MALE:  Yeah.
2:29 2:31 FEMALE:  If all goes well and I like it, I might stay with them.
2:29 2:29 MALE:  Oh, Pottery Barn, okay.
2:32 2:35 FEMALE:  Yeah.  And make stuff with them 'cause I like um retail goods.  
2:34 2:34 MALE:  Wow.
2:36 2:40 FEMALE:  I like things for the people like, and then they're like just general people like and not taking stuff at all.
2:39 2:39 MALE:  Yeah.
2:41 2:46 FEMALE:  So yeah.  So I mean, it's up my ally, and it's also in the Bay area, and that's like one of my big thing is--
2:44 2:44 MALE:  [interposing] Oh, staying in here.
2:47 2:47 FEMALE:  --I want to stay in the Bay area.
2:46 2:46 MALE:  Yeah.
2:48 2:51 FEMALE:  So it's almost like product design isn't in the Bay area and Pottery Barn's pretty much it.
2:50 2:50 MALE:  Yeah.
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  So--
2:51 2:54 MALE:  [interposing] Or even like--or maybe some registration [phonetic] of hardware around here, too?
2:56 2:58 FEMALE:  Registration--oh yeah.  Are they located here?  I think they might be.
2:56 2:56 MALE:  I think maybe.
2:59 3:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, and I should probably look up restorations, yeah.
3:00 3:03 MALE:  Yeah.  No, I think--no, I can't totally understand that because--
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  [interposing] I love it.
3:03 3:25 MALE:  --'cause they're like--you know why [unintelligible] industrial thing because you know that you can't really emotionally like get involved in like.  As a consumer, you can say yeah, I could potentially use something like this or I can really communicate with my friends or--even though you're not supposed to do that.  You're supposed to do the random sampling or whatever for.  So you can like is this a cool design?
3:28 3:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:26 3:27 MALE:  You know, and someone can give you an opinion on it.
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:28 3:31 MALE:  So and you can actually see, yeah.  I'm going to design it and I want $20.
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Yeah.
3:33 3:38 MALE:  So that's pretty cool.  Do you have any sort of uh like focus within Pottery Barn or do you--are they not that specific?
3:40 3:44 FEMALE:  So they're--um yeah, they actually have focus, and my focus is going to be decorative accessories.  
3:42 3:42 MALE:  Oh, okay.
3:44 3:52 FEMALE:  So um which probably means like lights, lamps, like candlelights or like things that are on the wall, photo frames or--
3:50 3:50 MALE:  [interposing] Okay.
3:53 4:02 FEMALE:  --like maybe shelves.  I'm not really sure.  That might fit into it.  But basically that kind of stuff, things kind of more on the wall, things that are slightly more decorative and less--less like, you know, less a desk.
4:00 4:01 MALE:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
4:03 4:03 FEMALE:  You know what I mean?  So--
4:02 4:08 MALE:  [interposing] That's a very challenging thing I can tell you because, you know, you go to a lot of people's houses and their walls are full of--
4:10 4:10 FEMALE:  [interposing] Yeah.
4:09 4:09 MALE:  --garbage.
4:11 4:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.  So you got to do good stuff.  So that's what I'm working on.
4:13 4:13 MALE:  Anyway, it was nice meeting you.
4:15 4:16 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
