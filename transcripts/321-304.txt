@0:00:06.2  0:00:08.9  MALE:  [unintelligible] [whispering].
@	              FEMALE:  oh, Thank you.
@0:00:09.5  0:00:11.3  MALE:  How's it going so far? 
@	              FEMALE:  Interesting, [unintelligible] [whispering]
@0:00:19.8  0:00:18.8  MALE:  [unintelligible]. 
@	              FEMALE:  Just want to uni.  It's like it's crunch for my masters.  [unintelligible].
@0:00:32.5  0:00:32.7  MALE:  Oh, that's cool.
@	              FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:00:37.1  0:00:38.6  MALE:  What are you majoring in? 
0:00:02.3  0:00:03.2  FEMALE:  Education.
0:00:40.8  0:00:44.5  MALE: [unintelligible].
0:00:06.0  0:00:27.3  FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm in a-- [stops whispering] I'm in a
one year program.  Ah, my focus is higher education.  And specifically issues
that women of color in graduate school face.  Specifically my main thesis is
on what challanges do women of color face when applying to prestigious, high-teired, graduate schools, [unintelligible] the humanities. 
0:01:05.5  0:01:16.7  MALE:  Wow.  That's quite a little project.
0:00:32.6  0:00:40.2  FEMALE:  Yes, that I just touched upon with the short 35-page paper.  But I'm deeply in uni--you know what I'm trying to say. 
0:01:17.7  0:01:18.2  MALE:  Yeah. 
0:00:40.7  0:01:48.0  FEMALE:  I'm deeply invested in it.  Um, I am inter-racial.  I am Japanese and Black and Indian, not from India, but American-Indian.  And, you know, the politics that be in this country have made me more conscious of who is being represented in my classes, who is being represented in my cohorts.  And I was blessed enough to go here.  I was blessed enough to get a masters at Harvard.  And pretty much I'm the only negro in the class.  I, I can say that I'm, you know, part Asian too. And I do personally affiliate with that.  And then there's situations where I feel like I have to stand up and represent the group that's not represented in my really diverse background.  So I'm just really passionate about um, just raising issues that maybe people haven't really intentionally not talked about, just issues that are important in higher education.  Like, um, minority retention or minority recruitment.  It's affecting my student development being the only this or the only that since I was little.                       I have to say--I, I know I'm going on and on, but I'm just saying.
0:02:25.3  0:02:33.0  MALE:  No, no, no, it's very interesting. 
0:01:49.2  0:03:12.9  FEMALE:  Like, I was um, blessed enough to get a really good education all my life.  I went to preppy schools all my life, um, really good schools.  Even from pre-K, my parents, you know, put me on a really good track.  Um, um, but starting fourth grade I was starting to be conscious of, you know, race and how I was different and, and um, feeling isolated and whatever because of differences in my life experience and others.  And it just kind of like--I think those issues need to be addressed.  And so that's the deep side of me.  And then the less deep side of me is that I'm--not less deep, but that was pretty intense stuff to share--but like the other part is I'm very artistic and passionate and sensitive.  And my friends know I give 150% to them.  Sometimes that's [unintelligible] telling me I should hold back.  But it's just I'm a very passionate--um, what's the word, um, like, whatever--and wholesome person.  And I like to make, I like to make art.  I like to comment on the culture I                       live in all the time through digital video, camera work.  I like to do documentaries, drawing, painting, dancing.  And I just started to write songs.  I'm--it's just I'm--it's a good time in my life.  But I should let you talk about you. 
0:03:49.3  0:04:42.5  MALE:  NO, no, no, that's awesome.  That sounds pretty interesting.  I grew up, I grew up in like the southern part of Brooklyn.  And I think I have encountered maybe some similar, kind of, racial issues that you because I grew up in the mostly Italian neighborhood.  But I feel like, since you're part Asian, do you think that you, you, you don't see that there's issues with that too?  Like ah, in college campuses?  Like, and you know--, obviously there's a lot of Asians here, you know what I mean.  Um, it seems like, I mean like, you know there might be a lot of things in the US, but I feel like there's always a lot of focus on like black/white kinda of aspect.
0:03:58.2  0:03:58.6  FEMALE:  Absolutedly.
0:04:35.7  0:04:56.2  MALE:  And I feel like, you know, there are so many Asians here, so many Latinos too, and that kind of thing.  I feel like we're kind of giving like the second teir of all this.  Like we're not, we're not counted as important when it comes to these kind of issues. 
0:04:12.0  0:04:15.4  FEMALE:  Right, right.  Especially with that du-ality [phonetic], that binary opposition.
0:04:53.2  0:04:59.9  MALE:  Right.
0:04:16.8  0:04:16.8  FEMALE:  Yeah.
0:04:55.0  0:05:04.1  MALE:  Yeah.  I should, should have got into this school and done something like this. 
0:04:21.0  0:04:22.8  FEMALE:  You still can.  You're still young and healthy.
0:05:00.1  0:05:06.9  MALE:  Yeah.
0:04:23.3  0:04:23.9  FEMALE:  Don't give up. 
0:05:01.6  0:05:10.4  MALE:  We'll see.  Well anyway, nice talking to you, all right. 
0:04:26.2  0:04:28.0  FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  Okay. 
@	              MALE:  uni.
