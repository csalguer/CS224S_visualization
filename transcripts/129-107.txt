0:04 0:05 MALE:  I'm trying to remember my alphabet.
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  Hi.  
0:07 0:07 MALE:  Hi, hi.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  I'm female129.  
0:08 0:08 MALE:  [unintelligible] 
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:09 0:10 MALE:  Nice meeting you.  
0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  What school are you in?
0:11 0:12 MALE:  School of education.
0:09 0:11 FEMALE:  You are, and I've never even seen you before.
0:14 0:15 MALE:  Are you in the school of education?
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  I am.  What are you studying?
0:17 0:20 MALE:  I am in the learning [unintelligible] and technology design PhD program.
0:17 0:19 FEMALE:  That's why I've never seen you before. 
0:22 0:26 MALE:  And I'm a third year so I try to kind of stay away from here as much as possible.
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  I can understand.  Are you finishing?  
0:28 0:35 MALE:  I am.  I just started my dissertation field study.  So, I started collecting data and am hoping to finish in a year if possible.  
0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Wow.  
0:36 0:38 MALE:  It doesn't look possible.  My committee doesn't think it's possible.  
0:35 0:39 FEMALE:  No?  What kind of research are you doing?
0:41 0:57 MALE:  I look at how people within organizations, co-workers, use technology especially for learning, and I look at organizations who have co-workers who are geographically distributed, so within--and internationally distributed.  So, U.S./India, U.S./Japan, U.S./Europe, those kinds of things.  So...
0:55 0:56 FEMALE:  Are you going to get to travel at all?  
1:00 1:01 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, I'm going to Japan, yeah.
0:59 0:59 FEMALE:  Excellent.  
1:02 1:05 MALE:  Yeah, so and I'm trying to learn Japanese, which is not that easy obviously. 
1:02 1:04 FEMALE: Good luck.  Have you ever been to Japan before?  
1:07 1:09 MALE:  No, no, no, so I'm excited about that.  
1:09 1:12 FEMALE: I was there a couple of years ago.  My sister was teaching English in Japan for a year.  So, I decided it was a good opportunity to visit her.  It's an interesting place.  
1:17 1:19 MALE:  do you like it?  Do you like [unintelligible], or?
1:16 1:37 FEMALE:  Uhm, I did like it--I mean it's hard not to like.  I don't think that I would move there for a long period of time.  It was a very--it felt very [unintelligible] in some ways.  People are very--they follow rules whether they're good rules or not.  You know, and sometimes it's just--it's like, you know.  
1:40 1:43 MALE:  That's what people have been telling me within the organization too.  
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
1:44 1:49 MALE:  So, like some of the problems that they have working is like people there try to follow rules a lot, and here it is not.  
1:46 1:49 FEMALE:  That was definitely my sister's experience. 
1:51 1:51 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:49 2:24 FEMALE:  It's funny though.  I actually was traveling last summer and changed planes in Japan, and when I got off the plan there was, you know, a person in a full uniform directing part of the traffic getting off the plane.  And we literally came off the plane like this.  They sent us down, you know, down this long hallway to the right.  There's another person standing at the end to make like a u-turn to come right back.  We ended up right across from where we started, and all the Americans were sort of like why didn't we just cross the street?  And all the Japanese people were just like following exactly where they were supposed to go.  We're like that's different.  Here you just follow the rules.  
2:28 2:28 MALE: That's a good example.  
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Here you just follow the rules is what they say.
2:29 2:29 MALE:  That's a good thing to keep in mind.  
2:26 2:29 FEMALE:  So, yeah, follow the rules and you'll have a great time. Do you eat seafood?
2:33 2:36 MALE:  I just started eating sushi.  I thought I better start eating something.  
2:33 2:42 FEMALE:  Well, they don't eat nearly as much sushi there, but they eat a lot of seafood, a lot of fish with--you know, little fish with heads on.  
2:46 2:48 MALE:  Yeah, I'm not a big fish eater or meat eater.  
2:45 2:47 FEMALE:  It was delicious, but yeah.  
2:50 2:51 MALE:  Yeah, so what program are you in here?
2:49 2:50 FEMALE:  I'm in the [unintelligible] program.  
2:53 2:54 MALE:  Oh, the new program.  
2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  Yes, the new program.  
2:56 3:01 MALE:  I'm surprised.  You are the first--those people I invited to all of our happy hours too, usually.  
2:59 2:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:02 3:02 MALE:  Usually on Thursday.  
3:00 3:04 FEMALE:  It's very particularly--we're very cohesive.
3:07 3:07 MALE:  Okay.  
3:04 3:10 FEMALE:  We bonded really tightly to each other sort of with a bunch of other people at the ed school.  
3:13 3:14 MALE:  Right, right, right.  
3:11 3:21 FEMALE:  We tend to sort of--not that we're anti-social with other ed school stuff, but I think because our group is so cohesive we don't necessarily go outside of it as much as we maybe should.  
3:24 3:26 MALE:  You have reputation for being party people.  
3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  We do?
3:26 3:27 MALE:  Yeah, you do.  
3:24 3:24 FEMALE:  Uh-oh.  
3:27 3:30 MALE:  That's all right.  That's [unintelligible] people.  
3:28 3:29 FEMALE:  We represented at the beer olympics.  
3:33 3:33 MALE:  Oh.  
3:30 3:30 FEMALE:  Did you go?
3:34 3:35 MALE:  No, I wasn't there.  
3:32 3:34 FEMALE:  We won [unintelligible].  
3:37 3:37 MALE:  Oh.
3:35 3:40 FEMALE:  It was quite a night.  So, that might be where that reputation came from.  
3:43 3:45 MALE:  Who were you competing with?  Who were the other teams?  
3:42 3:46 FEMALE:  LDP put up a good fight as did the [unintelligible] people.  
3:49 3:49 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:47 3:59 FEMALE:  Uhm, well there were some other sort of random SSE people, you know, but the teams, the real flip cup teams were step and LDP for the beer competition.
4:02 4:05 MALE:  Yeah, LDP people are fun people.  I hang out a lot with them usually.  
4:02 4:02 FEMALE:  We like them.  
4:06 4:07 MALE:  Because I was seeing them last quarter.  
4:05 4:09 FEMALE:  Okay.  That was our [unintelligible].  It was nice to meet you.  
4:11 4:12 MALE:  Nice to meet you.  Have fun.
