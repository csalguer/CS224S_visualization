1:11 1:23 MALE: That depends on where I can get a job from.  But so my area, the research labs are mostly in the East Coast.  So probably I have to move. 
1:21 1:24 FEMALE: Oh I see.  Yeah.  Have you been out there before to the East Coast?
1:27 1:28 MALE: I've been to New York a few times.
1:25 1:25 FEMALE: Okay.
1:30 1:30 MALE: But I have a sister living there.
1:28 1:32 FEMALE: Oh I see.  Well New York is a fun place to be.  I grew up there, so.

1:33 1:33 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:37 1:38 MALE: Yeah, I like New York.
1:35 1:35 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:16 2:18 MALE: Right now I live in 881, the high rises.
2:15 2:15 FEMALE: Okay.
2:19 2:25 MALE: But I didn't--I moved a lot, 'cause, uh, every time, uh, every year we need to go through the lottery process.
2:22 2:23 FEMALE: Oh the lottery.  I know.
2:27 2:28 MALE: So I was once kicked out of campus.

2:44 2:47 MALE: [unintelligible] closest one?
2:43 2:49 FEMALE: It's one of the closer ones.  Yeah.  I think so.  It's right next to Stanford West, I think it's called.
2:52 2:52 MALE: Oh that's not too bad.
2:49 2:57 FEMALE: Yeah. Yeah, it was bikable.  So it wasn't bad at all, not like it was in Mountain View or anything.
3:02 3:03 MALE: What do you study?
2:59 3:15 FEMALE: I'm actually here in the school of education.  Uh, I study early childhood development. Um, so kind of how young children [unintelligible] identity travels from one place to another, so.  I'm doing my dissertation field work right now, so.
3:18 3:19 MALE: So where do you do your work?
3:18 3:28 FEMALE: Um, I'm doing it actually in preschool classrooms right now and I'm following a certain number of kids out to their kindergarten classrooms, so.  We'll see how it goes.
3:32 3:34 MALE: So this is a master's program?
3:32 3:42 FEMALE: A doctoral program, it's a PhD program, yeah.  Yeah.  So I've been here for like four years now, so.  It seems like it's a long time [laughter]. So yeah.
3:46 3:49 MALE: What do you do in your spare time?
3:47 4:13 FEMALE: Oh well, you know, when we do have time to spare, I'm sure you can relate to this [laughter], um, I kind of enjoy kind of being indoors, sometimes being outdoors, other times doing hiking and stuff like that.  Um, I enjoy listening to music.  I enjoy singing and things like that.  Um, I can be a couch potato at times, too.  So there's that part of it.  But yeah.  Well it was very nice meeting you.
4:16 4:17 MALE: Yeah.  Very nice to meet you too.
4:15 4:15 FEMALE: Take care.
