0:23 0:23 FEMALE:  Linguistics.  [laughter] 
0:24 0:27 MALE:  Oh wow.   Any sort of linguistics or--
0:28 0:28 FEMALE:  Socio-linguistics. Mm-hmm. 
0:29 0:29 MALE:  How is that? 
0:30 0:30 FEMALE:  Um, like--
0:31 0:31 MALE:  Does it something to do with this? 
0:31 0:34 FEMALE:  I'm interested in dialects and like attitudes towards dialects.  
0:35 0:35 MALE:  Oh wow. 
0:35 0:43 FEMALE:  And um, just the like, interaction of language and power of language and ideology of language in society.  
0:44 0:45 MALE:  You can probably learn something from tonight.  
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  This sounds like a linguistics experiment, yeah.  [laughter] 
0:48 0:49 MALE:  Yeah I know.  [laughter] 
0:50 0:56 FEMALE: Me and my office mate that are here, that is here, we're like admiring their equipment.  Like we want to take their equipment and use it for our own purposes.  [laughter] 
0:57 0:57 MALE:  So why are you here tonight? 
0:58 1:00 FEMALE: My friend told me to come and I was oh okay.  
1:01 1:03 MALE:  Oh that's--that's a cop out answer.  
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  [laughter] It's true though.  What about you? 
1:06 1:06 MALE: Meet people.  
1:07 1:14 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah, well obviously to meet new people.  It's hard to meet people around here I think, everybody's so busy.  
1:15 1:18 MALE:  It's particularly hard as a guy, because it's mainly guys,  particularly among the graduate schools.   
1:19 1:22 FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah.  
1:23 1:24 MALE:  Like 8 to 1 guys.  
1:24 1:25 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. Yeah.  
1:25 1:26 MALE:  This is the best dive anywhere.   It's 50/50.   
1:27 1:29 FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah, okay, I can see that.  
1:30 1:30 MALE:  [laughter] 
1:31 1:32 FEMALE:  I don't know, I like to go to San Francisco, its fun.  
1:33 1:33 MALE:  Yeah? 
1:34 1:37 FEMALE:  Um, there's a little bit more of a social life there.  I think I want to try and move there.  
1:38 1:40 MALE:  Which part of San Franscisco do you like best? 
1:41 1:46 FEMALE:  I don't know, anything that's kind of downtown where it's lively and bustling and always people walking around and stuff.  It's fun. 
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Do you go clubbing in the city at all?  
1:49 2:02 FEMALE:  Sometimes, yeah.  I like it, it's fun.  But sometimes I have fun, sometimes I don't.  I don't know, it depends, like it's also hard to do because if you have a car then you can't drive, and then like drink and then drive back, so you have to figure out what you're going to do with your car, and like where you're going to stay and like--
2:03 2:05 MALE:  Yeah, it's a pain.  I'm moving into the city in October so.
2:06 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm thinking of moving there this fall too, for sure.  
2:09 2:10 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:11 2:14 FEMALE:  So as now we can ride the train for free and there's the bullet train, and it's like all these signs say move to the city.  
2:15 2:17 MALE:  I hadn't heard about that.  That makes it really attractive.  
2:18 2:20 FEMALE:  Yeah. For sure. 
2:21 2:21 MALE:  So what are you looking for in someone?  
2:23 2:25 FEMALE:  I don't know, that's a hard question.  You're the only that's--
2:26 2:26 MALE:  I just-- the first time I've asked.  
2:27 2:28 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:29 2:29 MALE:  Try new things so. 
2:30 2:40 FEMALE:  Um, okay.  [laughter] I don't know, that's hard.  Um, um, I can't--[unintelligible].  
2:41 2:42 MALE:  Let me answer it.   
2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  Let me ask you, what are you looking for--
2:45 2:45 MALE:  Okay. 
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  --and then you can start and then I'll see what I can think of.  
2:47 3:02 MALE:  I think, I think I'm looking for someone who's kind of worldly in their kind of views, and they might have traveled a lot.  Um, relatively, I don't know, kind of liberal rather then conservative.  
3:03 3:03 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:03 3:10 MALE:  Uh, has sort of a social conscience and like to be involved in non-profit stuff as well as working maybe.  Uh,--
3:11 3:11 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:12 3:12 MALE:  --like active outdoors things--
3:13 3:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:14 3:18 MALE:  --likes to just do things.  That would be my, that would be my short answer. 
3:19 3:33 FEMALE:  Okay, yeah, I think that, that, a lot of that stuffs the same for me, like, I'm super liberal, like and I'm, yeah, yeah.  [laughter] I like to travel, yeah a lot of that stuff.  
3:34 3:36 MALE:  Back at home I used to go to raves a lot, I haven't done it here because I don't know where they are.  
3:37 3:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:38 3:38 MALE:  But a lot of people would be shocked by that.    
3:39 3:46 FEMALE:  [laughter] Well I like to, I like to go, my friends were all shocked when I found that I like to go dancing in hip-hop clubs.  
3:47 3:47 MALE:  [laughter] 
3:48 3:49 FEMALE:  And it doesn't affect--
           [horn]
3:50 3:57 FEMALE:  --my personality at all, it's not really like me, but it's just something that's fun and silly.  I know.  
3:58 3:58 ANNOUNCER:  Get up and move.
