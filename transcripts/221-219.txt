0:00 0:08 MALE: Oh, this is awkward silence.  [laughter].  How are you?

0:02 0:03 FEMALE: I think, actually.

0:03 0:03 [Background Noise]

0:04 0:05 FEMALE: Now.  [laughter].  

0:13 0:14 MALE: I jumped the gun, I'm sorry.

0:07 0:07 FEMALE: I'm female221.

0:15 0:15 MALE: male219.

0:08 0:10 FEMALE: I think actually we met at the Valentine's Day speed-dating event.

0:18 0:18 MALE: We did?

0:11 0:11 FEMALE:  Yes.

0:19 0:19 MALE: How did that go?

0:13 0:14 FEMALE: [laughter].  I don't know.

0:21 0:23 MALE: Did you have -- did you have a lot of dates or, was it good?

0:15 0:17 FEMALE: No, it was pretty...

0:24 0:24 MALE: It was all right.

0:17 0:17 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:25 0:25 MALE: Yeah.

0:18 0:19 FEMALE: Uneventful, but whatever.

0:27 0:28 MALE: [laughter].  But it's fun.

0:21 0:21 FEMALE: Yeah.

0:29 0:29 MALE: So...

0:23 0:25 FEMALE: So, I'm sorry, I don't remember anything about you. [laughter].

0:32 0:35 MALE: I don't remember anything about you.  I was trying to think if I did.

0:27 0:27 FEMALE: What do you do?

0:36 0:37 MALE: I'm electrical engineering.

0:31 0:31 FEMALE: What year?

0:38 0:39 MALE: And you were history?

0:31 0:32 FEMALE: No, Slavic, Russian literature, yeah.

0:42 0:42 MALE: Okay, sorry.

0:35 0:38 FEMALE: No, I -- that's totally fine.  [laughter].  What year are you?

0:46 0:47 MALE: Uh, seventh year.

0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Are you almost done?

0:48 0:49 MALE: Yes.  [laughter].

0:42 0:43 FEMALE: What will do you next?

0:51 0:52 MALE: I think I'll be a professor, actually.

0:45 0:45 FEMALE: Yeah, really?

0:53 0:53 MALE: Yeah, so...

0:46 0:47 FEMALE: Are you looking for work right now?

0:55 0:57 MALE: Well, I'm trying to finish up my dissertation now -

0:49 0:49 FEMALE: First.

0:58 0:59 MALE: And then, uh, apply in early December.

0:52 0:52 FEMALE: Nice.

1:00 1:01 MALE:  How about you?

0:53 0:53 FEMALE: First year.

1:02 1:03 MALE: Yeah?  Where'd you come from?  

0:55 1:01 FEMALE:  Uh, I was up in Portland, the last five years, working.  Went to law school for a year and a half, and uh -

1:09 1:09 MALE: No, not for you, huh?

1:01 1:05 FEMALE: No, I went to law school, but I just realized I wasn't going to like being a lawyer very much.

1:13 1:15 MALE: So you decided to go back to school, huh?

1:07 1:09 FEMALE: Yes.  I'd rather -- I hate working.

1:17 1:21 MALE: [laughter].  I must agree with you there, too.

1:13 1:20 FEMALE: So I figured, you know, I love studying Russian literature, might as well go get paid to go school for six years, and just kind of put off that whole -

1:28 1:29 MALE: Phase of your life.

1:21 1:23 FEMALE: - whole career thing for as long as possible.

1:31 1:32 MALE: Not a bad choice.

1:24 1:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.

1:32 1:33 MALE:  There's worse places to be than here.

1:26 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  [laughter].  Many, many, many worse places.

1:36 1:36  MALE: So what were you doing in Portland?

1:30 1:42 FEMALE: Uh, I just worked at law firms and went to a school.  So I was doing a night program, so I was working full-time and going to school in the evening.  It was very iffy, like kind of scheduling -- you know this day's lunch I will read for this class -

1:48 1:49 MALE: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:43 1:45 FEMALE: - you know, and just like, really tense.

1:51 1:51 MALE:  That's exhausting, yeah.

1:45 1:46 FEMALE: Where were you before Stanford?

1:52 1:56 MALE: I was at Berkeley.  I was a Berkeley undergrad, so...

1:50 1:50 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

1:56 1:59 MALE: No, lived in the Bay my whole life, I need to get the hell out of here.

1:53 1:53 FEMALE: Really?

2:00 2:01 MALE: It's too nice, I don't -- I can't -

1:54 1:55 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:02 2:09 MALE: I can't enjoy this until I know how shitty the rest of the world is, you know?

2:02 2:03 FEMALE: You could just imagine how shitty it is.

2:10 2:11 MALE: [laughter].  Imagination is a good thing, yeah, yeah.

2:04 2:05 FEMALE: [laughter].

2:12 2:15 MALE: So what do you do for fun?

2:08 2:13 FEMALE: I don't know, just hang out with friends.  Go to events on campus, try to go to the city sometimes.

2:20 2:25 MALE: That's what always is remarkable to me, like going to the city is almost like a chore, is it?

2:18 2:18 FEMALE: Well...

2:26 2:28 MALE: Is it too far?

2:20 2:32 FEMALE: It's just not necessary, really.  Like it's -- it's kind of like an adventure.  I don't have a car, so that kind of depends on someone else being willing to go coordinate and stuff, but there's so much going on around here that I don't really feel the need to like - 

2:40 2:41 MALE: What do you do around here, then?  I don't know what goes on here.

2:33 2:43 FEMALE: I don't know, I -- nothing, really.  I just hang out with friends, go to dinner, hang out at coffee shops and stuff [phonetic], go to lectures sometimes, or performances.

2:51 2:54 MALE: That's quite an academic person there.  Going to -

2:46 2:48 FEMALE: Do homework sometimes, yeah.

2:56 2:58 MALE: Right.

2:50 3:00 FEMALE: No, I uh -- I don't know.  You know, it's like every time I ask someone, "What'd you do this weekend," they're like uh, you know, it's just such a blur that I don't even, you know, if I kept a list maybe I could come up with some interesting things.

3:08 3:11 MALE: [laughter].  Weekends are supposed to be that way, though I think.

3:03 3:04 FEMALE: Yeah, just relaxing.

3:12 3:15 MALE: You know, it's too heavy in the scheduling -

3:07 3:07 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:16 3:18 MALE: - what's the point?

3:08 3:09 FEMALE: Yeah, I haven't -

3:19 3:20 MALE: 'Cause you've got the rest of the five days to do that.

3:10 3:13 FEMALE: I agree.  How about you, what do you do for fun?

3:23 3:33 MALE: Good question.  [laughter].  I sometimes go to the city, yeah, you know, go to a bar there or something.  Around here, I don't know, I really don't have friends around here, it's kind of weird.

3:23 3:25 FEMALE: Where are your friends?

3:35 3:39 MALE: Most of my friends, 'cause I've lived out here my whole life, I didn't have the need to develop my friends at school.

3:29 3:30 FEMALE: Right, right, right.  Mm.

3:40 3:43 MALE: Which I think is a good and a bad thing, right?

3:33 3:33 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:43 3:46 MALE: 'Cause it gets you comfortable, so you know, 

3:36 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:47 3:50 MALE: I'm sure like maybe you had to meet a new set of friends, or -

3:39 3:52 FEMALE: Yeah, actually one of my friends from undergrad is in my program, so that was actually a really nice, just kind of immediate connection.  But other than that, yeah, I've just made random friends, you know, through -- actually, you know, Escondido village has a lot of fun events that they plan.

4:03 4:04 MALE: Oh, really?

3:53 3:57 FEMALE: Yeah, and so I do that kind of stuff, just to meet random people, and that's been fun.

4:08 4:11 MALE: That's the best about grad school, is also meeting so many different people -

4:00 4:00 FEMALE: Yeah.

4:12 4:14 MALE: - all the time.

4:02 4:02 [Background Noise]

4:03 4:03 FEMALE: It's nice.

4:14 4:15 MALE: Yeah.

4:05 4:05 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

4:15 4:15 MALE: Nice to meet you.  Take care.

4:06 4:06 FEMALE: Bye.
