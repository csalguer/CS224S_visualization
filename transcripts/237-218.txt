00:01  00:06	MALE:  I guess after filling in so many blanks, I think I'm just filling in anything I see.  
00:07  00:08	FEMALE:  Circle [horn], just circle.
00:11  00:12	MALE:  I don't even know if I'm filling in the questions.  In particularly, I'm having a really hard time with ambitious, like I can't --
00:13  00:15	FEMALE:  I know [laughter].
00:16  00:23	MALE:  Right.  So I like sit there and I just I can't.  I'm really having a hard time with ambitious and having a hard time with sincere.  Like I'm just sort of circling things and I'm not even looking at them.
00:24  00:36	FEMALE:  Right.  I'm curious to see where the sort of numbers on something like this sort of tilt out too, it just seems like you remember some are going to basically cluster in some range.  You're really not going to be using the full spectrum.
00:37  00:44	MALE:  You're really not going to be using the full spectrum.  I mean like, none of like all these kids.  Who's going to get really that -- not that high of ambitious like compared to like --.
00:45  00:45	FEMALE:  That's right.
00:46  00:48	MALE:  I remember some of my friends in high school, like if it ever seems like extremely ambitious.
00:49  00:55	FEMALE:  Right.  Or like you know, courteous we don't have that many opportunities to be particularly not courteous, so --.
00:56  00:57	MALE:  No, I mean they didn't shove me out of a chair, so I guess I'll give them like a seven.
00:58  00:59	FEMALE:  Slap me in the face [laughter].
00:59  001:00	MALE:  Yeah, like seven to eight is probably the minimum.  So how is it going tonight?
01:00  001:06	FEMALE:  Well, [unintelligible].
01:07  001:08	MALE:  Nice, nice.  So what is it that you do here at Stanford?
01:10  001:14	FEMALE:  At Stanford, I'm in the Ed school.  So you're reaching the end of the Ed School line.
01:15  001:16	MALE:  That's right, reaching the end of the Ed School.  Because back there is like the Business turn.
01:16  001:19	FEMALE:  It's like here, I didn't realize there was a Business School cluster, but --
01:20  001:31	MALE:  Yeah, that's what I heard when I was even over there, they were like we'll you're in the business train right now and then you're later you'll hit the Ed train.  I was sort of fainting -- I guess that's not a very good for my sincerity.  Because I was prepared for the Ed train a little bit. 
01:32  001:35	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  See that's good, at least you knew it was coming.
01:36  001:37	MALE:  Right.  From the guy's side there's been kind of an engineering train. 
01:38  001:52	FEMALE:  There's definitely an engineering tilt, I'd say, but it's been a little less clustered.  Like it's been I feel like -- maybe it just that there's like distinctions within right.  So you get like a few aero, astro, a few electrical, a few you know whatever else they do.
01:53  001:55	MALE:  It is -- it is curious for that I mean so we're done here because we're the end of the outfit right?
01:56  001:59	FEMALE:  I don't know.  I mean, it's Q, but I don't know how they -- okay.  I don't know how they --
02:00  002:01	MALE:  I think that's how they did it.  Huh.  How they clustered it.
02:01  002:02	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:02  002:13	MALE:  Because I'm just wondering, I'm wondering if that would make an interesting like test too, if it's like interested in like Education because they're the last ones I picked in class and with people at the beginning of the alphabet.  They were go get them.
02:14  002:15	FEMALE:  We're they like --
02:16  002:18	MALE:  And so they did really well with like Business.
02:19  002:22	FEMALE:  Maybe.  Yeah, I don't know if they assigned letters by like --
02:23  002:24	MALE:  I'm conducting my own research here.  All right.
02:24  002:25	FEMALE:  There you go.  You got a project right here.
02:26  002:29	MALE:  Yeah, or they did it because they thought it would be really funny to see how people react to the same thing.
02:30  002:36	FEMALE:  To like having a million like Ed School and be like oh, the Ed School people again.  This is cool, whatever [laughter].
02:37  002:38	MALE:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Well, I'm not an engineer though.
02:38  002:39	FEMALE:  So what do you do?
02:39  002:40	MALE:  I'm in Russian literature.
02:41  002:42	FEMALE:  Russian literature.
02:43  002:49	MALE:  Yeah.  And I guess I'm trying to think of a very cleaver reason why I study Russian.  I still can't figure out why I do it.  I mean I guess it's --
02:50  002:50	FEMALE:  Do you like it?
02:51  002:56	MALE:  Yes, I like it.  Yeah, it's sort of a combination of a lot of things that I like to do and that's [unintelligible], so. 
02:57  002:59	FEMALE:  So, do you do like Russian literature as a college student?
03:00  03:06	MALE:  Yeah I did it in college and like Russian language.  Like right now I teach Russian and also TA for a literature class. 
03:07  03:07	FEMALE:  Wow.
03:08  03:21	MALE:  So, it's pretty interesting.  I mean if I could sort of do the combination of literature and language is so different.  It's always just very interesting that we're in one theoretical department.  And it's interesting that a lot of the jobs that are out there they require both.  
03:22  03:22	FEMALE:  They're not really.
03:23  03:24	MALE:  But it's like one doesn't necessarily translate to the other like at all.  
03:25  03:26	FEMALE:  Right.
03:27  03:29	MALE:  Some like skills translate; I mean you could probably tell me more since your in education than I could. 
03:30  03:48	FEMALE:  Well, I mean I know -- like I was an English Major in college and I do a lot of work -- like I work at the Writing Center.  And like so there's English and the English departments are off then --.  Like where the places where writing is supposed to be taught, but frankly like literary analysis is much different from most of the writing you'll do in any other field.
03:49  03:50	MALE:  Yeah, from like clear concise coherent writing. 
03:51  03:51	FEMALE:  Right.  I mean --
03:52  03:53	MALE:  That people want to actually read.
03:53  04:01	FEMALE:  Right, I mean ideally there are like literary analyses are at least clear and coherent.  But, the type of analysis done is very different, so.
04:02  04:03	MALE:  I don't even know if that's ideal.  At least I think sometimes it's like -- 
04:04  04:05	FEMALE:  You think they're trying to [laughter] --
04:05  04:08	MALE:  I think it's ideal the other way because then no one can understand what you said and they assume it's just -- it must be too intelligent.
04:09  04:13	FEMALE:  It must be brilliant [laughter] [horn].  Maybe.  All right, well, nice to meet you.
04:15  04:16	MALE:  Exactly.  Wow.  What are we, we're Q right.
04:16  04:16	FEMALE:  Q.
04:17  04:17	MALE:  Very nice to meet you, too.
