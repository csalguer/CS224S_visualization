0:09 0:10 FEMALE: Hi.  I'm female336.  Pleased to meet you.

0:10 0:11 MALE:  female336?  I'm male303.  What's up?

0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  Hi.  I'm okay.

0:13 0:17 MALE:  Do you got it figured out by now [unintelligible] or whatever? 

0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  Huh, yeah, I'm fairly confused.

0:18 0:19 MALE:  Fairly confused?

0:19 0:26 FEMALE:  But that's okay--well, in the sense that--I mean, I can't--I can't even remember what I said to whom and--

0:26 0:26 MALE:  Oh.

0:27 0:28 FEMALE:  You know.

0:28 0:28 MALE:  Yeah.

0:29 0:30 FEMALE:  How are you doing?

0:31 0:31 MALE:  Pretty good.

0:32 0:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.

0:33 0:50 MALE:  I have this little philosophy [unintelligible] I've just--just started, so I just got a new pair of flip flops and I don't usually wear flip flops.  The idea is I'm wearing flip-flops [unintelligible] life's go to be pretty good.  Because I can't move very fast, so I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere, right.

0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  [laughter].

0:51 0:57 MALE:  And it must be pretty warm outside if I'm wearing flip-flops, so that's--life, again, must be pretty good.

0:57 0:59 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Those are pretty powerful flip-flops to make the sun shine.  [laughter].

1:01 1:04 MALE:  [unintelligible].  What about you?

1:04 1:04 FEMALE:  Um...

1:05 1:07 MALE:  Do you have any new kind of earth shattering things you've figured out?

1:08 1:08 FEMALE:  Tonight?

1:09 1:09 MALE:  Yeah.

1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  Or are you talking about lately?

1:11 1:11 MALE:  In general, yeah.

1:12 1:13 FEMALE:  [laughter].  I really love wind surfing.

1:13 1:14 MALE:  Really?

1:14 1:16 FEMALE:  I'm taking a wind surfing class and--

1:16 1:17 MALE:  Where--where is that at?

1:17 1:21 FEMALE:  It's at a--at a lake south of Stanford.  It's five minutes south of here.

1:21 1:22 MALE:  Oh, [unintelligible] right on.

1:22 1:23 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.

1:23 1:24 MALE:  Okay.  [unintelligible] falling in?

1:25 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh, hell yeah.  I mean, falling in is the first thing you do.  [laughter].  

1:29 1:29 MALE:  [unintelligible].

1:30 1:32 FEMALE:  Like staying up is--s the thing.  Yeah.

1:32 1:33 MALE:  Is--are you here?

1:33 1:40 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  [laughter].  Well, I do a lot of sailing and so I think that helps just [unintelligible] learning how to--

1:40 1:41 MALE:  [unintelligible] you do a lot of [unintelligible] when?

1:41 1:56 FEMALE:  Um, 2003 2004.  I do skip sailing, which is this totally unbalanced boat that goes way too fast for its weight.  And you have to like hang off a rope and a harness and try to keep that balance and [unintelligible].

1:56 1:56 MALE:  Okay.  

1:57 2:00 FEMALE:  After you have already done that, wind surfing is pretty easy to pick up. 

2:02 2:02 MALE:  What do you do here?

2:03 2:05 FEMALE:  I study medicine.  I'm a medical student.

2:05 2:06 MALE:  Do you--okay.  

2:07 2:07 FEMALE:  And you?

2:08 2:09 MALE:  I'm in the business [unintelligible].

2:11 2:12 FEMALE:  Do you like it?

2:12 2:14 MALE:  Yeah.  It's growing on me.

2:15 2:15 FEMALE:  Is it your first year?

2:16 2:16 MALE:  Yeah.

2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  Um-hum.

2:17 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, I mean, it's just--I mean, classes are [unintelligible] but the people.  I think the people is the reason like that it's definitely grown on me.  [unintelligible] different people.  I think it's just [unintelligible] parts of the world.  I mean, I had dinner the other night a woman from Russia, a guy from Holland, a guy from England, you know, me, I'm like from Colorado, I mean, like, all right [unintelligible].

2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  [laughter].

2:37 2:41 MALE:  I mean, just like all of these [unintelligible] together and now we're going to get together like [unintelligible] so, I'm definitely enjoying that.

2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Yeah.

2:42 2:43 MALE:  What about you, where are you from?

2:44 2:46 FEMALE:  From Tennessee.  I went to school on the East Coast.

2:46 2:47 MALE:  Where did you go to school?

2:47 2:48 FEMALE:  When I was at Princeton.

2:48 2:48 MALE:  Okay.

2:49 2:53 FEMALE:  And I think I'm more of a West person though.

2:54 2:54 MALE:  Why--why so?

2:55 3:10 FEMALE:  Because I found the East Coast to be pretty traditional and, you know, this is what we've done for hundreds of years and, therefore, we're going to keep doing it just because.  Where Stanford or the West Coast is more tolerant, more--more impressive.

3:11 3:18 MALE:  So, what do you like doing that kind of [unintelligible] your trend I guess besides your--your, uh, your, you know, your wind surfing?

3:19 3:23 FEMALE:  [laughter].  Um, pretty much I'll [unintelligible].

3:23 3:26 MALE:  What would you do that I would never expect from meeting you before this?

3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Acting in Oxford.

3:31 3:32 MALE:  Acting?  What--what did you do?

3:32 3:44 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I was the patient in--or the people in the lesson by Nesco [phonetic] and I was a player in [unintelligible] and [unintelligible], um...

3:45 3:46 MALE:  How was it?

3:45 3:48 FEMALE:  Oh, it was so much fun.  I loved that play.

3:48 3:48 MALE:  Yeah?

3:49 3:50 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Um--

3:51 3:54 MALE:  For instance, I mean, did you like--did you--was it exhilarating to be on stage?

3:54 4:04 FEMALE:  It's--it's pretty fun, um, I think--I started theater in high school and it' really changed my life, blah.

4:05 4:05 MALE:  [laughter].

4:06 4:09 FEMALE:  But you wouldn't believe--the thing that you wouldn't believe is that I--I'm a sail plane glider pilot. 

4:10 4:10 MALE:  You're a what?

4:11 4:16 FEMALE:  Sail plane glider pilot and, uh, yeah.  That--that's exhilarating.

4:17 4:18 MALE:  All right.  Nice meeting you.

4:19 4:19 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
