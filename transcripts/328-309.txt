0:00:33.9 0:00:34.5 FEMALE:  I'll try.
0:00:20.5 0:00:23.5 MALE:  Sounds like your- you've been learning Chinese before.
0:00:37.3 0:00:42.2 FEMALE:  I studied for a year in college, but it's all gone.  It's very sad.
0:00:26.3 0:00:28.8 MALE:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
0:00:42.7 0:00:43.7 FEMALE:  Where are you from in China?

0:00:47.0 0:00:52.4 FEMALE:  Well, a lot of the people who are studying here seem to be sort of from Beijing at least at the business school.
0:00:36.9 0:00:39.2 MALE:  Uh, well- oh really?
0:00:52.8 0:00:53.6 FEMALE:  Beijing or Shanghai.

0:00:52.5 0:00:53.8 MALE:  Oh.  You like consulting?
0:01:09.4 0:01:11.2 FEMALE:  I'm not sure like is the right word.
0:00:57.1 0:00:57.5 MALE:  Uh-huh.

0:00:58.8 0:01:00.1 MALE:  Oh, you have done before, okay.  
0:01:13.5 0:01:23.1 FEMALE:  And it was educational, and I enjoyed aspects of it.  And it's great if, you know, if that's what you want.  It's all right for now.
0:01:03.5 0:01:09.8 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
0:01:23.1 0:01:25.4 FEMALE:  But I'm not sure about the long term.  How about yourself?
0:01:11.5 0:01:13.6 MALE:  Uh, I'm doing material science and engineering.
0:01:27.8 0:01:28.6 FEMALE:  Oh interesting.
0:01:14.5 0:01:17.5 MALE:  And I'm doing PhD for [unintelligible] PhD program.
0:01:31.5 0:01:31.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:18.2 0:01:19.5 MALE:  And this is my fifth year.
0:01:34.6 0:01:35.2 FEMALE:  Wow.
0:01:20.6 0:01:21.4 MALE:  So yeah.
0:01:35.3 0:01:37.0 FEMALE:  You're- you're close to finishing up then.

0:01:38.1 0:01:38.6 FEMALE:  Wow.
0:01:24.4 0:01:26.4 MALE:  Maybe it takes another year- 
0:01:40.4 0:01:41.0 FEMALE:   Uh-huh.
0:01:27.1 0:01:29.0 MALE:  -or maybe half year or maybe one year right now.
0:01:42.5 0:01:46.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  What do you- what- what's your specialty within material science?
0:01:32.5 0:01:35.0 MALE:  Um, I'm studying like tiny nano particles.
0:01:49.1 0:01:49.5 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:01:35.6 0:01:42.8 MALE:  And um, [unintelligible] nano particles and also I did a characterization of the [unintelligible] particles, too.
0:01:52.9 0:01:57.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.
0:01:42.7 0:01:47.6 MALE:  So I've been studying the microstructure and analyze and study their physical properties.
0:02:01.7 0:02:02.6 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
0:01:47.8 0:01:48.4 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:02.7 0:02:05.7 FEMALE:  To help me get my head around this, what's the practical application of that?
0:01:51.7 0:02:03.3 MALE:  Uh, well, first of all, it can be used as a contrast agent called MRI, MRI imaging and second it can be used in uh, say uh, biosensing [phonetic]- 
0:02:11.2 0:02:18.1 FEMALE:   Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
0:02:03.4 0:02:13.4 MALE:  -so it can detect DNAs, uh, by- by using these particles- these kind of particles as a fact for the specific DNAs.
0:02:20.0 0:02:28.3 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Cool.
0:02:14.0 0:02:14.5 MALE:  Yeah.
0:02:29.0 0:02:30.6 FEMALE:  That's excellent.  Are you enjoying yourself?
0:02:16.4 0:02:20.3 MALE:  Yeah.  I enjoy- enjoy the research a lot.  Yeah.
0:02:33.6 0:02:37.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Cool.  And what do you do- what do you enjoy outside of research?
0:02:23.8 0:02:25.3 MALE:  Oh, music.
0:02:39.7 0:02:40.1 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:25.9 0:02:29.3 MALE:  Yeah.  I like, uh, English [unintelligible] or I usually just listen to pop songs.
0:02:43.7 0:02:44.1 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:02:29.8 0:02:36.4 MALE:  And sometimes go karaoke and sometime I just go to some dance event like JamX.  Do you have [unintelligible] with JamX?
0:02:50.8 0:02:51.2 FEMALE:  Huh--uh.
0:02:36.7 0:02:41.2 MALE:  Oh.  This is like- just like a monthly- monthly dance event in Stanford.
0:02:54.8 0:02:55.9 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
0:02:41.6 0:02:43.9 MALE:  Uh, it's [unintelligible] from Beijing.
0:02:57.6 0:02:59.8 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  What kind of dance--like- 
0:02:45.6 0:02:50.5 MALE:  Well, it's just kind of dancing like salsa, like a waltz, swing.
0:03:02.9 0:03:05.6 FEMALE:  Oh great.  Uh-huh.  Oh, how fun.
0:02:51.4 0:02:52.0 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:06.9 0:03:15.0 FEMALE:  My um- my best friend from- from- one of my best friends from college, she's a PhD candidate in psychology.  She and her husband are very serious ballroom dancers.
0:03:00.6 0:03:01.3 MALE:  Oh really.
0:03:15.5 0:03:22.3 FEMALE:  So she's been trying to persuade me that I should take up ballroom dance for years, but I have two left feet.
0:03:05.1 0:03:11.0 MALE:  Uh-huh.  [laughter].  I see.
0:03:25.4 0:03:29.7 FEMALE:  But no, that sounds like fun.  Now what kind of pop music?  Chinese pop music or western pop music?
0:03:14.2 0:03:16.4 MALE:   Uh, both Chinese and western, yeah.
0:03:30.2 0:03:30.7 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
0:03:16.7 0:03:20.8 MALE:  Yeah.  But uh, I know more Chinese songs than English songs.
0:03:35.3 0:03:37.4 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  So more with the Chinese karaoke?
0:03:21.3 0:03:29.2 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, basically the- the place I go have a lot of-  more Chinese songs than English songs.
0:03:43.9 0:03:44.4 FEMALE:  Fair enough.
0:03:29.8 0:03:36.7 MALE:  Yeah.  But- but my English songs are trying to pick- uh, trying to uh, catch up.  [laughter].  Yeah.
0:03:49.0 0:03:53.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I admit I'm not- I'm not all that with- even with English songs.
0:03:39.7 0:03:40.1 MALE:  Oh really?
0:03:54.8 0:03:59.5 FEMALE:  I- so I was in Arkansas for a week over the summer- 
0:03:45.5 0:03:46.1 MALE:   You were what?
0:04:00.7 0:04:01.4 FEMALE:  In Arkansas.
0:03:47.5 0:03:49.2 MALE:  What- where is- what is Arkansas?
0:04:03.6 0:04:07.0 FEMALE:  It's a state kind of northwest- northeast of- 
0:03:51.5 0:03:55.2 MALE:   Oh, Arkansas.  Oh, okay.  It's where Clinton was uh- 
0:04:09.6 0:04:10.6 FEMALE:   Yes, was governor.
0:03:56.0 0:03:57.0 MALE:  -governor there.  Okay.
0:04:11.7 0:04:18.3 FEMALE:  Um, so I was there for a week over the summer and we all decided to go karaoke.
0:03:59.1 0:04:04.1 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
0:04:18.7 0:04:22.3 FEMALE:  And there were just about five songs I knew.  But it was really fun.
0:04:07.7 0:04:08.3 MALE:  [laughter].  Uh-huh.
0:04:22.8 0:04:24.9 FEMALE:  It was mostly country songs.  That was the problem.
0:04:09.3 0:04:11.7 MALE:  Oh, I see.  So that's in bars or- 
0:04:26.7 0:04:27.9 FEMALE:   Uh, it was a bar.
0:04:13.2 0:04:14.1 MALE:  Or club, okay.  
0:04:29.3 0:04:32.1 FEMALE:  Yeah, I think a bar is probably  a more honest characterization.
0:04:16.0 0:04:16.7 [horn]
0:04:17.6 0:04:18.9 MALE:  All right.
0:04:32.7 0:04:35.9 FEMALE:  Club would be too grand for this place.  This was Arkansas.
0:04:20.3 0:04:21.9 MALE:  Uh-huh.  All right.  
0:04:37.3 0:04:37.7 FEMALE:  Well- 
0:04:22.8 0:04:25.9 MALE:   Okay.  So um, what else do you in your spare time?
0:04:41.3 0:04:47.4 FEMALE:  Um, clubbing occasionally.
0:04:32.9 0:04:33.3 MALE:  Uh-huh.
0:04:47.9 0:04:51.6 FEMALE:  Um, I like music.  I like reading.
0:04:37.0 0:04:37.6 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:04:51.5 0:04:53.2 FEMALE:  It's very, very sad, but- 
0:04:38.6 0:04:39.3 MALE:   All right.
