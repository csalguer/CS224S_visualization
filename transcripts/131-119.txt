0:32 0:33 FEMALE:  Are you here with other friends, or?  
0:42 0:45 MALE:  I am.  Well, I am--not in mechanical though.  
0:37 0:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, I have met some other people from--
0:51 0:52 MALE:  [interposing]  Electrical maybe.  
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  A lot of electrical people.  
0:54 0:55 MALE:  Yeah, definitely.  
0:46 0:47 FEMALE:  Do you like it here?  
0:56 1:09 MALE:  I love Stanford.  Stanford is pretty good.  It's--I went from a--I went to Princeton so it's sort of similar in some ways.  But--yeah, but it's a great place to be out here definitely as a grad student.  
1:01 1:01 FEMALE:  Funny, I never would have equated the two.  
1:12 1:21 MALE:  Oh, really.  Okay.  Well, it's kind of the private--the private school bubble type thing.  
1:12 1:14 FEMALE:  Yeah, the ivory tower.  
1:23 1:23 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Like privileged.  
1:25 1:29 MALE:  But I mean it's been great, but, boy, where are you from originally?  
1:20 1:22 FEMALE:  I'm actually from right around here.  
1:32 1:32 MALE:  Okay.  
1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  I'm from San Jose.  
1:35 1:38 MALE:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Los Angeles.  
1:27 1:32 FEMALE:  What year [unintelligible] graduate?  
1:41 1:42 MALE:  I was 2000.  
1:33 1:35 FEMALE:  Okay, actually I knew some people in your class.  
1:45 1:45 MALE:  Oh really?  
1:37 1:38 FEMALE:  I did this [unintelligible] program.  
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Oh, you did.  
1:39 1:46 FEMALE:  Yeah, and I went in and thought I'd be an aid, but I knew we were class of 2000 and class of 2001.  
1:55 1:56 MALE:  What class--what year are--
1:47 1:47 FEMALE:  Class of 2001.  
1:57 1:59 MALE:   Oh, so we're pretty close in age then, okay.  
1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  Yeah, so [unintelligible].  Were you the class builder?  
2:01 2:03 MALE:  Yeah, Cecelia.  Yeah.  
1:54 1:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, she's one of my good friends actually, used to be.  Like can I ask--
2:07 2:09 MALE:  [interposing]  How did you guys meet--from PID?  
2:00 2:01 FEMALE:  Yeah, PID.  
2:10 2:11 MALE:  Wow, that's funny.  It's a small world.  
2:03 2:03 FEMALE:  Do you know about PID?  
2:14 2:23 MALE:  I didn't--like I know Sas more through other people, and I know PJ because he did a lot of political stuff at Princeton.  
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, he's very active.  
2:25 2:37 MALE:  Yeah, absolutely.  So, I did know a bunch of people.  I could probably remember their names, but--wow, that's cool.  So, what have you done--if this is your first year in law school, what did you do after?  Where did you go to undergrad?  
2:28 2:29 FEMALE:  I did my undergrad at [unintelligible].  
2:39 2:39 MALE:  Okay.
2:30 2:30 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:40 2:40 MALE:  All right.  
2:32 2:32 FEMALE:  After I [unintelligible] there I--[unintelligible] in Colorado?  
2:44 2:45 MALE:  Okay, Okay.  
2:35 2:37 FEMALE:  For a few years.  
2:47 2:49 MALE:  For what company were you--I'm just curious.  
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  For Jamis.  
2:50 2:51 MALE:  Okay, I'm sure I've heard of them, yeah.  
2:43 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, and it's like a small [unintelligible].  
2:54 2:54 MALE:  Right.  
2:47 2:53 FEMALE:  So, I did that for a few years, like I traveled around.  I'd always get enough and finally came back.  
3:02 3:06 MALE: Yeah.  I did my East Coast thing.  
2:57 2:57 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:06 3:07 MALE:  It's kind of nice to be back out here.  
2:58 2:59 FEMALE:  Did you like it?  
3:08 3:22 MALE:  I did.  I mean it was a good experience for me, definitely.  I like--I love like the West Coast that much better I have to admit.  I do a lot of cycling.  I do a lot of outdoor stuff.  You know, so this is one of the best places to do that.  
3:13 3:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, Jersey is not [unintelligible].  
3:25 3:28 MALE:  It's different definitely.  There's good parts of Jersey though admittedly.  
3:19 3:23 FEMALE:  I remember visiting it.  It's a pretty grey area.  
3:33 3:39 MALE:  The campus is--Princeton is sort of an anomaly of the New Jersey mystique that you get when things are [unintelligible].  
3:30 3:31 FEMALE:  It can be a really pretty campus though. 
3:41 3:46 MALE: Yeah, it's definitely cool.  So, what do you do outside the law school?  Like if you guys are pretty busy.  
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, this year not an awful lot.  
3:49 3:49 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:41 3:42 FEMALE:  I basically just hang out with friends.  
3:52 3:52 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:44 3:48 FEMALE:  Eighty percent is pretty close to campus.  [unintelligible].  
3:58 4:00 MALE:  Oh, you haven't converted to snowboarding?  
3:52 4:02 FEMALE:  You know, I [unintelligible] part of the reason I went out there was because I wanted to [unintelligible] actually [unintelligible].  
4:12 4:12 MALE:  Right.  
4:07 4:14 FEMALE:  And I tried snowboarding when I was out there, and it's fun.  But maybe it was because I tried learning on a day where like there was basically just ice caps.  And every time you'd fall I'd be--
4:24 4:25 MALE:  [interposing]  It hurts.  It hurts a lot, yeah.  
4:16 4:20 FEMALE:  And I just didn't like to be [unintelligible] every time. Are you a snowboarder?  
4:30 4:32 MALE:  I converted from skiing to snowboarding definitely.  
4:23 4:24 FEMALE:  Like most people did.  
4:34 4:35 MALE:  Well, it was nice meeting you.  
4:26 4:27 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
