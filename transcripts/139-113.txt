0:00:40.3 0:00:49.3 MALE:  I guess it's just kind of like more intense and focused.  And, um, I guess people are less friendly.  And, you know, just generally in a bad mood with bad weather.

0:01:45.3 0:01:48.1 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  Are you going to poker night tomorrow?  [laughter]

0:01:58.9 0:02:00.6 MALE:  That guy, he knows his cards.
0:01:59.4 0:02:00.7 FEMALE:  Does he? [laughter] 
0:02:01.4 0:02:03.6 MALE:  Oh yeah, yeah.  He has it down to a science.
0:02:02.3 0:02:03.3 FEMALE:  I imagine.
0:02:04.6 0:02:06.4 MALE:  He like gives me all this advice and stuff.
0:02:04.5 0:02:05.8 FEMALE:  [laughter]
0:02:06.8 0:02:12.8 MALE:  Like he knows all like the probabilities and the different things and, yeah, he's obsessive about Texas hold em.
0:02:08.6 0:02:15.6 FEMALE:  Oh my gosh.  Wow.  So is- is he okay to play with?  [laughter]  
0:02:16.8 0:02:22.4 MALE:  Um, yeah.  You'd be surprised.  Even if you know what you're doing a lot of times it's just luck.  Yeah.
0:02:17.2 0:02:22.1 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's very true.
0:02:23.5 0:02:44.2 MALE:  [unintelligible] yeah, 'cause I've seen lots of times when he's made good decisions but he's just been like cleaned out by somebody else who just happened to have a lucky hand.  So, it's- yeah, so I wouldn't worry about it.  You probably wouldn't notice skill versus non-skill.  It's more- more luck than anything.  But if you play a lot it's like in the long run if you have like good skill, then you're going to start to make money.
0:02:43.4 0:02:43.8 FEMALE:  Yeah.   
0:02:43.9 0:02:47.8 MALE:  You said you- are y- are you a master's or-
0:02:46.7 0:02:47.2 FEMALE:  Um-
0:02:48.3 0:02:50.0 MALE:  [unintelligible] quals [unintelligible] 
0:02:48.7 0:02:51.3 FEMALE:  I think I'm sticking with master's.  Yeah. 
0:02:51.7 0:02:53.2 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
0:02:53.3 0:02:59.7 FEMALE:  I started out I wasn't too sure and then the more I thought about it, the more I wasn't sure if I really wanted to do a PhD and-
0:03:01.2 0:03:01.6 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:00.1 0:03:11.4 FEMALE:  -and then feeling that like- like having that hesitation it concerns me.  So I think I might just go to work and if- if I decide I really want to go back for a PhD- 
0:03:11.9 0:03:13.4 MALE:  Yeah, it's never too late.
0:03:12.1 0:03:17.9 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It- it's important to me that I really want to be there 'cause I wasn't sure about the master's and I'm- I'm kind of like- 
0:03:18.3 0:03:20.6 MALE:  Oh really?  Well that's only one year.  So-
0:03:18.0 0:03:20.4 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So I'm like-   
0:03:20.6 0:03:21.8 MALE:  Or a couple, you know.
0:03:20.1 0:03:22.4 FEMALE:  -I can- I can handle like a year or two but-
0:03:23.2 0:03:23.7 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:03:22.4 0:03:26.4 FEMALE:  -when it comes to like six give or take a coup- you know-
0:03:27.3 0:03:27.9 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:26.2 0:03:31.4 FEMALE:  -hitting on the higher end it's hard to give up that much that time not knowing if it's something I really want to do. 
0:03:31.9 0:03:32.3 MALE:  Yeah.
0:03:32.7 0:03:36.8 FEMALE:  Yeah, so did you start in the grad program here as soon as you finished Princeton.
0:03:37.5 0:03:40.9 MALE:  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  So-
0:03:37.2 0:03:43.7 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So are you- do you foresee the end of the tunnel soon?  [laughter] 
0:03:44.5 0:03:50.0 MALE:  I think after next year.  I think my professor's hinting that it's almost time to get out or something like that.  
0:03:47.8 0:03:52.4 FEMALE:  [laughter] So what area are you, um, researching?
