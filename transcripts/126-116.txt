00:01  	00:01  	MALE:  [horn] [unintelligible]

00:07  	00:11  	FEMALE:  Um, I'm not sure they're only giving us like ten seconds to fill out the evaluations [unintelligible].

00:08  	00:13  	MALE:  Yeah and I'm just really slow.  The point is I'm not thinking on these.

00:22  	00:26  	FEMALE:  It would be interesting to go back on my answers and see if I've been giving the exact same answers.

00:27  	00:36  	MALE:  I think for myself I am actually.  Like pretty much the same on all of these so.

00:36  	00:36  	FEMALE:  Hum.

00:39  	00:44  	MALE:  I think it would be better give fewer of these a little more time because I think you could give it a little more thought, but.

00:45  	01:02  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  [unintelligible] end of quarter reviews of professors you know.  People are [unintelligible] and half the time people don't answer the longer more thoughtful questions.  

01:00	01:01	MALE:  I usually -- I don't often, yeah.

01:02	01:12	FEMALE:  I -- so far I've actually done it most of the time because I've either had outstanding professors or terrible professors.  And I feel like I need to tell the terrible professors they need to [unintelligible] they are doing and I feel like I should let the outstanding professors know you're doing a good job.

01:13  	01:13  	MALE:  Yeah.

00:14  	01:17  	FEMALE:  But if their kind of mediocre, what am I suppose to say, you're okay.

01:18  	01:22  	MALE:  I worry about the handwriting, it's a small department.

01:22  	01:27  	FEMALE:  So the professors ever [unintelligible] keyboard [unintelligible].

01:29  	01:32  	MALE:  I don't know I know one of nameX's friends got a bunch of them back and like --

01:34  	01:35  	FEMALE:  What department are you in?

01:35  	01:36  	MALE:  [unintelligible].

01:37  	01:38  	FEMALE:  How big is that?

01:38  	01:40  	MALE:  Uh, there's like ten of us.

01:40  	01:41  	FEMALE:  Per year or total?

01:42  	01:51  	MALE:  Per year, more around like 80 people, roughly total, maybe 100.  I don't know like it's plausible, like I don't know, but they might type them in you might be right.

01:51  	01:53  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  I just assumed that actually I never really through about it.

01:54  	01:54  	MALE:  Yeah.

01:55  	01:57  	FEMALE:  Well and I'm in engineering.

01:58  	01:58  	MALE:  There's like a thousand of you.

01:59  	02:07  	FEMALE:  A billion.  But ours are done by the Kappa Beta Phi honor society, but it's an engineer honor society, so I'm an engineer and [unintelligible]. 

02:07  	02:07  	MALE:  No.

02:08  	02:08  	FEMALE:  So

02:09  	02:10  	MALE:  That's true, that's probably different.

02:11  	02:21  	FEMALE:  And since its school wide they're probably not returning the evaluation sheets right back.  I kind of hope that they [unintelligible] because I don't want to --

02:22  	02:28  	MALE:  Well, so many people you probably would be fine.  The effort is trying to -- matching up [unintelligible] out a little bit.

02:29  	02:29  	FEMALE:  Yeah, so.

02:30  	02:31  	MALE:  So what area of engineering?

02:32  	02:33  	FEMALE:  Electrical, there really are a billion of them.

02:33  	02:36  	MALE:  Yeah, there are.  Are you PhD or Masters or?

02:37  	02:42  	FEMALE:  For the moment I'm in the Masters.  My intention is to get the PhD [unintelligible] before them.

02:42  	02:44  	MALE:  Oh so you would take your test and --.

02:44  	02:47  	FEMALE:  Yeah, I failed the [unintelligible] course the first time, so.

02:48  	02:49  	MALE:  I hear that a lot of people do though.

02:50  	03:06  	FEMALE:  Yeah. And, I'm trying to decide the real issue is I know I could pass the [unintelligible] again next year.  The question is why am I getting the PhD.  Sometimes I worry that I'm doing the PhD just to get the PhD.  And so the question is do I really, really, really want it.  So I'm --

03:06  	03:12  	MALE:  That's the hardest type of question.  Like it really is.  Like figuring out what you want do and like --.

03:13  	03:31  	FEMALE:  I really want to teach.  But then I've been thinking, do I want to teach at a university or would I be happy to teach at community colleges or even high school.  So, if I teach high school or community college a PhD would be not necessary.  Somewhat of a good amount of time and money to do that, so.

03:32  	03:45  	MALE:  Actually if you want to teach [unintelligible] better reason to get a PhD, because I hear a lot of people are expressing.  Like if that's really what you want to do.  But some people are like oh I don't know, in which case it's really marginal.

03:45  	03:48  	FEMALE:  Um, what are you working on?

03:49  	04:10 	MALE:  Um, I'm a first year so I'm just basically taking classes.  I'm in a PhD program there's no Mast -- well you can get a masters if you leave, but nobody enters [horn] with the intention of getting a masters, but yeah I'm sort of kind of figuring out what I want to do.  I don't know I feel like you want [unintelligible] time to reflect and like see.

04:11 	04:11  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

04:12  	04:14  	MALE:  [unintelligible].

04:15  	04:15  	FEMALE:  You too.
