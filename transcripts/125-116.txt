00:01  	00:06  	MALE:  [horn]

00:06  	00:07  	FEMALE:  No problem.

00:09  	00:12  	MALE:  [unintelligible]

00:12  	00:12  	FEMALE:  [laughter] 

00:26  	00:26  	MALE:  I'm male116.

00:27  	00:27  	FEMALE:  I'm female125.  

00:28	00:28	MALE:  Good to meet you.

00:28	00:29	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.

00:29  	00:31  	MALE:  And so what program are you in?

00:31  	00:33  	FEMALE:  I'm in Education, actually.

00:33  	00:36  	MALE:  Okay, there's a lot of you guys because you're easy to incur right?

00:36  	00:37  	FEMALE:  Yeah, exactly.

00:38  	00:43  	MALE:  Which is kind of good, I mean because usually I think like women don't like to go to these things as much as guys do.  

00:44  	00:51  	FEMALE:  Well the Ed School is easy feeding ground for them.  So, most are women, so.  How about you?  What are studying?

00:51  	00:52  	MALE:  I'm in Political Science.

00:52  	00:53  	FEMALE:  Okay.  

00:53  	00:55  	MALE:  I'm just in year one.

00:55  	00:57  	FEMALE:  Are you getting your PhD?

00:58  	01:03	MALE:  Yeah, Masters doesn't do much for you, so it's like PhD or bust sort of. 

01:04  	01:11  	FEMALE:  Yeah I guess I wouldn't really -- If [unintelligible].  I'm trying to think of a job one would get with a Masters in Political Science, but.

01:11  	01:12  	MALE:  I don't want to think like that. 

01:12  	01:15  	FEMALE:  Yeah, [unintelligible] academia I would imagine, right?

01:15  	01:25  	MALE:  Actually, I mean you learn a lot of statistics and -- or not a lot, but statistics and stuff that's useful, but it's not like a pass.

01:25  	01:26  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

01:26  	01:28  	MALE:  So what year are you in are you finishing up?

01:28 	01:30  	FEMALE:  I'm actually doing a Masters so it's just a one year program.

01:30  	01:32  	MALE:   Oh really?  Just one year.

01:32  	01:32  	FEMALE:  Yeah.

01:33  	01:34  	MALE:  So what are you going to do next year?

01:34  	01:35  	FEMALE:  Um, hopefully I'll do educational research.

01:35 	01:37  	MALE:  Okay.  In like a think tank or?

01:37  	01:41  	FEMALE:  Yeah, that kind of a thing with an institute of some sort.

01:41  	01:42  	MALE:  Do you want to be in D.C. or?

01:43  	01:54  	FEMALE:  I've actually I think I'm looking more to stay around here, but I'm not entirely sure yet.  Some -- it just depends on wherever I can get a job?  I have an interview on Tuesday in Midland Park though, so.

01:54  	01:55  	MALE:  Where?

01:55  	01:55  	FEMALE:  At SRI.

01:56  	01:58  	MALE:  And what is that?

01:57  	02:06  	FEMALE:  It's a -- SRI is a big research institute and they have a couple of other institutions [unintelligible] one of those [unintelligible].  So hope things go well.

02:07  	02:10  	MALE:  Well, every interview you do I think you get marginally better.

02:10  	02:16  	FEMALE:  Yeah, definitely.  So are you from California originally or?

02:16  	02:23  	MALE:  No, I - I actually, I didn't visit out here.  I've been to California like going through airports.  But I figured I would like it.  I think it's great.  I'm from Illinois.

02:23  	02:24  	FEMALE:  Okay.

02:25  	02:25  	MALE:  How about you?

02:26  	02:28  	FEMALE:  I'm from Rochester, New York.  

02:29  	02:30  	MALE:  Oh, yeah, cold.

02:30  	02:31  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  

02:31  	02:44  	MALE:  A lot of people I knew in our department from undergrad went to Rochester.  Rochester is good for political science and they had a big role in shaping it and so they would always just talk about how cold the winter was.

02:44  	02:46  	FEMALE:  Yeah, it's very cold.

02:46  	02:48  	MALE:  Did you go to school in Rochester for undergrad?

02:48  	02:49  	FEMALE:  I didn't, I went to Williams.

02:49 	02:50  	MALE:  Oh, okay.

02:50  	02:53  	FEMALE:  Um, so I was in Massachusetts, similarly cold.

02:53  	02:54  	MALE:  What year did you graduate?

02:54  	02:55  	FEMALE:  2000.

02:55  	03:03  	MALE:  Hmm, so I have a friend, nameX, I don't know if you knew her.  I don't remember what year she graduated.  She's a little older than me.

03:04  	03:05  	FEMALE:  Do you know what class or what year?

03:06  	03:08  	MALE:  Oh, okay I would guess about 98 or 99 I would guess.

03:09  	03:09  	FEMALE:  Okay.

03:10  	03:12  	MALE:  I think she's about four years older than me roughly.

03:13  	03:21  	FEMALE:  Okay.  I don't recognize the name, but Williams is one of those places that you recognize everyone's face because it's such a small, small place.

03:21  	03:22  	MALE:  I don't know how big it is?

03:22  	03:23  	FEMALE:  its 2000 --

03:24  	03:24  	MALE:  For the class or --

03:25  	03:25  	FEMALE:  Students.  No, 2000 total.

03:26  	03:27  	MALE:  Wow that's --

03:27  	03:31  	FEMALE:  So its way small, so I would probably recognize her if we ran into each other.  

03:31  	03:32  	MALE:  Yeah, if you had a few years of overlap, yeah.

03:32  	03:35  	FEMALE:  Yeah.  Exactly.

03:36  	03:40  	MALE:  She loved it.  I mean I haven't seen her for a while, but she used to talk about how great it was.

03:40  	03:47  	FEMALE:  It's a great place.  It's a wonderful, wonderful school I can't complain.  I'm going back to visit in a couple of weeks so I'm excited about that.

03:47  	03:48  	MALE:  For a reunion or?

03:48  	03:56  	FEMALE:  Um, I'm actually not going for my reun -- my five year reunion is this year, but I'm missing that because it's the same weekend as graduation here.  So, --

03:57  	03:58  	MALE:  Missing your reunion for -- 

03:58  	04:02  	FEMALE: Exactly, [horn] [unintelligible] got go to actual graduation.

04:03  	04:03  	MALE:  Well, yeah.

04:03  	04:04  	FEMALE:  Anyway.  It was nice to meet you.
