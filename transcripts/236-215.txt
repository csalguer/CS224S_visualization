1:44 1:47 MALE:  How did you find Idaho, how does it compare to Stanford and China?  

1:42 1:50 FEMALE:  Because Idaho is the only school that offered me a citizenship, then I don't really have -- otherwise I couldn't afford it you know?  

1:58 1:58 MALE:  Yeah that's true.

3:08 3:09 MALE:  Have you ever considered going to Britain or --  

3:04 3:07 FEMALE:  Well it's kind of -- it's --

3:53 3:56 FEMALE:  But how come you came at this time of the year?  

4:05 4:12 MALE:  It's different for research purposes, you just start whenever your PhD finishes or whenever the position is open, so --  

4:08 4:08 FEMALE:  So you are a PhD student?

4:43 4:44 MALE:  Yeah I got that in England.  

4:37 4:39 FEMALE:  I see.  In genetics?  

4:47 4:55 MALE:  I say genetics, but it's a mixture of things.  It's molecular biology and physiology and some biochemistry.  

4:50 4:56 FEMALE:  Why so [unintelligible] like [unintelligible] it was more money?  

5:06 5:16 MALE:  I like to understand how diseases work and [unintelligible] them.  Okay, it was good to meet you.
