0:04 0:06 FEMALE:  I know, me too.
0:06 0:11 MALE:  I mean, I went like, started off really badly and then I got very good.  And now I'm back to being bad again.

0:17 0:20 MALE:  So, what are you a, education student?
0:19 0:20 FEMALE:  No, a...
0:20 0:21 MALE:  Oh, that's a shocker.
0:21 0:22 FEMALE:  Mechanical engineering.
0:22 0:23 MALE:  Really?
0:23 0:26 FEMALE:  Product design, actually, it's a small division.
0:26 0:28 MALE:  So you work in, do you work in that little building where the Machine Shop is?
0:28 0:29 FEMALE:  Yeah, yep, yep, that's me.
0:29 0:30 MALE:  That's cool.
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  I have a little space there.
0:31 0:32 MALE:  In the Machine Shop?
0:31 0:35 FEMALE:  It's called the Design, well, it's, um, it's called the Design Loft.  It's next to the Machine Shop.
0:35 0:36 MALE:  Oh, okay.
0:36 0:38 FEMALE:  They, it's like uh, with the two, like, locked doors.
0:39 0:45 MALE:  Yeah, okay, I don't know.  I haven't been in there, but I used to walk through there getting coffee.  It's on my way, on the way to my building.
0:44 0:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, all that junk, like in that, that, that's where we are.
0:45 0:49 MALE:  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Occasionally there'd be something interesting there.
0:49 0:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, we--
0:50 0:56 MALE:  I've always wanted to get into the uh, Machine Shop and build some stuff myself.  Like, uh, I've got this idea for roller blades, like, like.
0:56 0:57 FEMALE:  Uh-huh, What idea?
0:57 0:58 MALE:  Yeah, it's kind of cool, you take--
0:58 0:59 FEMALE: [interposing] I love roller blades.
0:59 1:09 MALE:  You take roller blades and, I want to have like really big wheels but, but you can't put them below your foot, so you put them at an angle.  And I'd want to build, I don't think it would work, would it?  Probably you would know better.
1:07 1:09 FEMALE:  Um, I think it might, it might.
1:10 1:14 MALE:  But that would be the idea.  So you'd have like, really big wheels, but they're at an angle so it's like, but they'd be, you know.
1:15 1:16 FEMALE:  Hum, that could work, yeah.
1:16 1:19 MALE:  I mean because also, when you roller blade, you're at an angle so it'd be, you know.
1:19 1:21 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah, that, you totally are.
1:20 1:23 MALE:  Wouldn't it, so you put them on the outside so that pull, whatever, anyway.
1:23 1:33 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.  Um, I ah, made this, uh, roller blade holder thing because I, I used to, I roller blade a lot too, and like I was, like try to keep a pair of like slippers with me or something so, just like, anyway, long.
1:34 1:38 MALE:   Right.  Right, right, right, always because you know it's constantly dragging, you just slip the blades on and off or something?
1:38 1:43 FEMALE:  No, like, you;re roller blading somewhere but you don't want to carry your, how do you carry your shoes?
1:43 1:44 MALE:  Right.
1:44 1:47 FEMALE:  You know, I would carry it in my hand like this and it would like, it'd make my muscle really tired.
1:48 1:49 MALE:  Right, right, right.
1:48 1:55 FEMALE:  So I, I wanted to design this like belt clip that could hook, hook your like, freaking shoes on there, oh my god.
1:50 1:59 MALE:  Yeah, that's true, yeah, that's a good idea.  How about can you just take off the, make a design that could take off wheels and, that would be like?
1:59 2:02 FEMALE:  Yeah, but that's just really like, complicated.  And I'd have to design my own roller blade brand.
2:01 2:04 MALE:  Yeah, because then that'd be crappy roller blades, crappy shoes, one of those things.
2:03 2:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
2:04 2:07 MALE:  Right, so, so, when are you graduating, in a year?
2:06 2:09 FEMALE:  Uh, 2006, so it's a two year program, I just started this year.
2:09 2:10 MALE:  Oh, okay.
2:10 2:11 FEMALE:  I know.
2:10 2:12 MALE:  Okay, and you're just going to get your masters and that's it.
2:13 2:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's not really a PhD based program because there's not research involved.  However, I'm kind of doing some research on my own.
2:19 2:21 MALE:  And then what are you going to do after that?
2:21 2:31 FEMALE:  Um, I think, well, I, I wasn't really sure when I started the program, but, they really push the entrepreneurship thing on you.  And I actually, I'm kind of interested in that, like just...
2:31 2:32 MALE:  So are you going to start your own company?
2:33 2:43 FEMALE:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I have a lot of products that I'm working on right now I think have some potential.  And um, I also, I also have this interest to do comics and I've, educational comics.  And I want to like...
2:44 2:45 MALE:  Really?
2:44 2:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's a--
2:45 2:48 MALE:  [interposing] so you like, uh, you read comics a lot or something, or?
2:48 2:50 FEMALE:  Uh, I draw them.  I, I'll--
2:49 2:50 MALE:  [interposing] you draw them?
2:50 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah, I,
2:50 2:53 MALE:  What kind of, like, any may comics, or?
2:53 2:55 FEMALE:  No, [laughter], no, I'll have to show you my style sometime.
2:53 2:56 MALE:  Oh, okay, what kind of?
2:56 2:57 FEMALE:  Well, I um,
2:58 2:59 MALE:  Like super heroes?
2:59 3:20 FEMALE:  Yeah, there, it's a style of, what's a good style that it looks like.  Maybe uh, oh gosh, I never thought about what it looks, resembles.  I, I'm decent, I'm not, I've done this for like years, like, over 10 years alright, so.  I do like super hero stuff.  My, my, my characters are like Vector and Scalor [phonetic] and they like save the world with science puns.
3:21 3:22 MALE:  Wow.
3:21 3:22 FEMALE:  And um [laughter].
3:22 3:24 MALE:  [laughter] well that's interesting.
3:23 3:29 FEMALE:  [laughter] Oh, no, but actually, no, no, I'm writing this proposal right now where I want to use them in like educational curriculum.
3:27 3:33 MALE:  [laughter] That's, that's very funny.  So, so who's stronger?  Who would win in a fight?  Vector or Scalor?
3:32 3:38 FEMALE:  Vector, okay, it's like a Batman, Batman and Robin. [laughter]  Scalor has no direction in life, right.
3:34 3:45 MALE:  Okay because he can, he can do, do two things at once.  He's just like oh, Vector like jumps around him and comes behind him and you know what I mean, multidimensional.
3:43 3:52 FEMALE:  No, well, it's like a professor and his, like, research, research student and they, uh, they save the world.  Scalor's really dorky and Vector's more of the Batman character.
3:48 3:55 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Right, thinks outside the box kind of guy.  So, that's interesting.
3:54 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah, so, uh, maybe, and I'm, yeah maybe doing something with it.
4:00 4:01 MALE:  Wow that was fast.
