0:02 0:04 FEMALE:  Hi.  female123.
0:01 0:02 MALE:  I'm [unintelligible].
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:04 0:05 MALE:  So I guess you are from law school?
0:08 0:10 FEMALE:  How'd you know?  Did you hear me talking?
0:08 0:09 MALE:  Oh I guessed.
0:12 0:13 FEMALE:  Oh, you just guessed that I--
0:10 0:10 MALE:  Yeah.
0:14 0:15 FEMALE:  How did you manage to guess that?
0:12 0:15 MALE:  Well because you were with a couple of people who mentioned that they are from law school.
0:19 0:23 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  Right.  I thought you were stereotyping me, and you're like, oh, you look like a lawyer [laughter].
0:21 0:22 MALE:  No, no, no.
0:25 0:28 FEMALE:  So what--I'm at a disadvantage.  I don't know what program you're in.
0:25 0:27 MALE:  Which programs did you mention?
0:30 0:31 FEMALE:  Which program are you in?
0:28 0:29 MALE:  I'm in electrical engineering.
0:31 0:33 FEMALE:  Electrical engineering?
0:30 0:31 MALE:  Yeah.  PhD, third year, yeah.
0:35 0:36 FEMALE:  Oh, he's in electrical engineering too.
0:33 0:33 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
0:36 0:37 FEMALE:  Do you know him?
0:34 0:36 MALE:  I knew--I came to know him today.
0:40 0:42 FEMALE:  Oh.  Okay.  So how far along in the program are you?
0:40 0:51 MALE:  Oh, I don't know how much more time it will take us, like three or two--two or three more years.  Like, it takes five or six years, something like that.  But you can stay longer if you wish.  Some people don't mind, if you have money.
0:54 0:55 FEMALE:  Do you want to stay longer?
0:53 1:00 MALE:  No, I don't.  I--it's actually five or six years is a sufficient time to get to know what you want to know, and then, move on, I guess.
1:04 1:08 FEMALE:  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, some people really like staying in graduate school.  They stay for like 10 years.
1:06 1:15 MALE:  And it it's--like if it's Stanford, it's like, really cool.  But yeah, you have other things like your parents to say that, what are you doing right now here?  And get a job.
1:18 1:25 FEMALE:  Get a job.  Get a mortgage.  What are you doing?  Stop living like a grad student with a ratty old futon, yeah.  No.  I know.
1:22 1:34 MALE:  And like, people like actually don't understand, like, how your electives and all those, like, when they ask you what are you doing so many years in a PhD?  It's very difficult for--to make them understand.
1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].
1:34 1:35 MALE:  That hardly matters, but that's okay.
1:39 1:42 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  So is all your family--I take it your Indian?  
1:39 1:40 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
1:42 1:44 FEMALE:  Are they all back in India or are they here?
1:42 1:43 MALE:  No, no.  My family's in India.  And uh--
1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  Are you going to go back?  Or...
1:45 1:46 MALE:  Oh, I don't know.
1:49 1:50 FEMALE:  Hard to say, huh?
1:47 1:48 MALE:  Yeah.  Most probably not, but maybe.
1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Oh.
1:50 1:51 MALE:  It's difficult, yeah.  But--
1:54 1:55 FEMALE:  How do you find them--oh, sorry, go ahead.
1:52 1:53 MALE:  No, no. [unintelligible].
1:57 1:58 FEMALE:  I was just going to ask how you found America to be so far?
1:55 1:57 MALE:  Oh, definitely wonderful.
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Really?
1:58 1:58 MALE:  Yeah.
2:01 2:02 FEMALE:  Oh, that's--
1:59 2:16 MALE:  It's like Stanford is a totally way out, like, people have told me if you are in some other part of America, you might have a different impression.  But because of Stanford, it's like so cool here.  And nice weather, beautiful roads, and everything is so good.  I like it.
2:20 2:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You really do look like you like it a lot.  Have you been to other parts of the U.S.?
2:21 2:25 MALE:  Uh, no, I just went to Washington, actually.  [unintelligible].
2:28 2:28 FEMALE:  The state or D.C.?
2:25 2:47 MALE:  Not D.C.  The [unintelligible] state.  And I was there in the summer, so I didn't see the rain [laughter].  Uh, and it was very--it was even more like their [unintelligible] more beautiful than what we have in California.  Have you been to Redmond or Seattle, somewhere like that?  Okay.  It's--I like Seattle now [unintelligible] better than San Francisco's [unintelligible].
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Oh, really?
2:48 2:48 MALE:  Yeah.
2:52 2:55 FEMALE:  But it's not very much like a city, though, is it?   It's kind of smaller, right?
2:52 2:56 MALE:  No. It's almost like it's--it's like San Francisco.
2:59 3:00 FEMALE:  Really?
2:57 3:11 MALE:  It's like, you have everything to do there like, and, uh--but it's very much scenic.  Like you can go around, and like, there's [unintelligible] National Park.  And you can go to Vancouver, Canada.  And like, there's lots of things to do out there in the summer when the weather is nice.
3:15 3:15 FEMALE:  Wow.
3:13 3:17 MALE:  So I like that too.  I get all the wonderful [unintelligible] like I [unintelligible].
3:21 3:22 FEMALE:  Oh, excellent.  Excellent. That's--
3:20 3:23 MALE:  So how long is for you at Stanford now?
3:26 3:28 FEMALE:  I have two more years after this.
3:25 3:25 MALE:  Uh-huh.
3:29 3:31 FEMALE:  A law degree is three years, and I'm in my first year right now.
3:29 3:32 MALE:  And which kind of a field would you pick in the law?
3:36 3:42 FEMALE:  Um, I'm not really sure yet.  But I think I probably want to practice.  I think I want to work for the government and be a U.S. Attorney.  I think that would be great.
3:41 3:48 MALE:  Oh okay.  So we could--we would be like when you would come alumni meets or something like that?
3:51 3:52 FEMALE:  I would what [unintelligible]?
3:48 3:57 MALE:  Like the alumni meets of Stanford?  Alumni meets?  The Stanford Alumni get together or so, whatever that is, the class of 2000 in 25 years--
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  Oh.
3:57 3:58 MALE:  [unintelligible].
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  No.  No.
4:00 4:00 MALE:  Nice meeting you.
4:04 4:05 FEMALE:  It was nice to meeting you too.
