0:02 0:02 FEMALE: Hi. 
0:01 0:02 MALE: Hi, male310.
0:04 0:05 FEMALE: I'm female335. 
0:03 0:04 MALE: female335, nice to meet you. 
0:06 0:07 FEMALE: Yeah, nice to meet you, too.
0:04 0:05 MALE: How are things going with you today?
0:08 0:09 FEMALE: Good.  Yeah. 
0:06 0:07 MALE: Yeah?  Nice. That's awesome.
0:09 0:10 FEMALE: Yeah, it's fun.  It's fun to meet new people.
0:09 0:12 MALE: Yeah.  It's, like, I've never done something like this before. And, you know--here we go--
0:13 0:13 FEMALE: Me neither. 
0:13 0:15 MALE: Okay.  So tell me about yourself, like, your--
0:18 0:26 FEMALE: Um, I grew up in Sacramento and didn't steer far from there.  I went here for college, too, and then I went straight through to grad school.
0:23 0:24 MALE: Wow.  What'd you do in under grad? 
0:27 0:28 FEMALE: Um, I'm getting my PhD in biology. 
0:26 0:27 MALE: In biology.  Okay.
0:29 0:30 FEMALE: And in under grad, I studied math. 
0:30 0:31 MALE: Math? 
0:32 0:38 FEMALE: Well, and now I'm studying mathematical biology, so modeling.  Uh, yeah. 
0:34 0:36 MALE: Interesting.  Wow.  I never heard of that.
0:39 0:49 FEMALE: Yeah, well, it's, uh, it's an interdisciplinary field.  It's been around for a while, but what we do is try to use mathematics to predict, um, genetic transmission, basically. 
0:48 0:48 MALE: Are you enjoying it? 
0:50 0:52 FEMALE: I think it's interesting.  Yeah, I like it  a lot.  Um hm. 
0:50 0:51 MALE: Nice.  That's cool.  What year are you in now?
0:53 0:54 FEMALE: My third year. 
0:52 0:53 MALE: Your third year?  And you have about--
0:56 0:58 FEMALE: I have another year to go.  Yeah. 
0:55 0:57 MALE: Another year to go?  Wow.  What are you going to do afterwards?
1:00 1:03 FEMALE: Go into academia, so just keep doing research. 
1:01 1:06 MALE: Yeah.  Here, do they hire their own grads here, or, like, their--you usually have to go somewhere else?
1:08 1:25 FEMALE: Um, once in a while they do.  I mean, I think really exceptional people they do.  Um, but what I want to do in between is a post-doctoral fellowship.  So I'd go away for a few years, and basically, then you're, like, an independent researcher.  So you don't have the responsibilities the faculty members do.  Yeah.  And then look for a job. 
1:23 1:25 MALE: Wow.  That's cool. No, but it sounds like it's something really interesting. 
1:28 1:28 FEMALE: I'm sorry?
1:26 1:30 MALE: It sounds like you're doing something very interesting, and, like, very practical and, like, yeah.  No.
1:30 1:42 FEMALE: Well, I think it's interesting. Yeah, it's neat because it brings together--I study human evolution, so it brings together, like, human history and anthropology and biology.  Um, I mean, I really liked math and statistics.
1:40 1:40 MALE: Yeah. 
1:42 1:49 FEMALE: But it's neat to get to apply it to something that's kind of--I think humans are all very curious about themselves, so it's really neat to study.
1:45 1:48 MALE: Yeah, yeah, that's cool.  That's really cool.
1:51 1:52 FEMALE: Yeah, what about you?  What are you doing at Stanford?
1:49 1:53 MALE: Um, I'm in--I'm gonna get my MBA.  I'm in my second year doing that. 
1:55 1:55 FEMALE: Um hm. 
1:53 1:54 MALE: So about to graduate. 
1:57 1:57 FEMALE: That's great. 
1:55 1:59 MALE: And, um, yeah, and then--you know, I'm not totally ready to leave here, but--
2:03 2:05 FEMALE: It's a hard place to leave.  I'll, I'll tell you that much. 
2:01 2:12 MALE: [unintelligible].  Yeah.  I'm actually planning on coming back down.  I'm, like--because I'm going to live around here. And so I'm kind of like, okay.  At least I know I'm going to be in the area.  I can still come here on Saturdays and roller blade.  It's okay.  
2:14 2:16 FEMALE: Yeah.  You can still come to--what are they called on Fridays?
2:14 2:15 MALE: Oh, LPFs?
2:18 2:19 FEMALE: Yes, there you go. [laughter] 
2:17 2:18 MALE: [unintelligible].  Have you been to one of those?
2:21 2:32 FEMALE: I've been to a couple, um, but, yeah, I don't frequent them.  But usually, you know, I'll be walking back to the department after dinner, and I'll hear it, and I'll be like, "Oh, the MBA students get to have fun.  I have to go to work." [laughter]. 
2:28 2:30 MALE: You should just join in.  You can totally join in.  
2:33 2:34 FEMALE: I know, I know. 
2:31 2:32 MALE: We're welcoming of everyone.
2:34 2:37 FEMALE: I came once when it was a huge beer pong [phonetic] tournament.  It was, like--
2:34 2:36 MALE: Oh, I think I missed that, actually.
2:38 2:39 FEMALE: It was crazy. 
2:37 2:37 MALE: That was last year?
2:41 2:42 FEMALE: Maybe the year before, even. 
2:40 2:40 MALE: Year before?  Okay. 
2:43 2:46 FEMALE: Yeah, because I think I still haven't quite figured out what--what it was. 
2:42 2:44 MALE: It was my qual.  Yeah, it was my qualifier.  Yeah. 
2:47 2:47 FEMALE: Yeah. 
2:44 2:50 MALE: Yeah, I think I, I missed that.  I remember, um--actually, a lot of great stories come out of that, and I was like, "Oh, and I missed this one." 
2:53 2:54 FEMALE: Oh, no. [laughter]
2:51 2:58 MALE: Yeah. No, um, it's pretty fun.  It's, it's--although when you get out of class at noon, it's hard to get motivated to come back to that.  'Cause now I live off campus. 
3:01 3:01 FEMALE: Oh. 
2:59 3:01 MALE: Before I would, like, come back, like, when I lived at Schwabb [phonetic].  
3:04 3:04 FEMALE: Right. 
3:01 3:06 MALE: But, like, living off campus, you're like--you know, you rarely, like, come back when you get out.  Yeah. 
3:09 3:15 FEMALE: Right.  So what do you do on Wednesdays?  I think this whole Wednesday off thing is, like, a big conspiracy that other people should learn from.
3:13 3:14 MALE: It's the busiest day.
3:17 3:18 FEMALE: That's what my friends tell me.
3:15 3:16 MALE: It is the busiest day. 
3:19 3:21 FEMALE: Because that's when you have meetings and study groups and all that?
3:18 3:19 MALE: That's when you have everything.  
3:22 3:22 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:19 3:25 MALE: I mean, for me, this quarter is probably my lightest Wednesdays in general. Um--
3:26 3:26 FEMALE: Um hm. 
3:25 3:31 MALE: So I really don't have too much that goes on because I'm not recruiting.  I'm not doing any of those things. But when I was, that was the busiest. 
3:33 3:34 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:31 3:39 MALE: Because literally, you fly out--like, when you recruit in New York, for example, you fly out Tuesday to go for Wednesday, all day and then come back and be ready for class on Thursday.
3:42 3:42 FEMALE: Yeah.  
3:40 3:44 MALE: But it's great because, like, it breaks your week into two, and think of your weeks in two days.
3:47 3:48 FEMALE: That's nice.  Yeah. 
3:45 3:49 MALE: You know, and I think of what I have to do this two days, what I have to do the next two days, you know?
3:50 3:52 FEMALE: That's funny.  Monday, Tuesday.
3:50 3:50 MALE: Yeah. 
3:53 4:00 FEMALE: So it seems like the recruitment process happens really early in the year, or maybe my, my sense of time is also quite off because nothing really changes. 
3:56 3:59 MALE: Yeah, well, some terms come, like, in the fall.
4:02 4:02 FEMALE: Right. 
3:59 4:04 MALE: Right?  So the ones that come really [unintelligible] do that.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking with you. 
4:07 4:08 FEMALE: It's nice talking to you, too. 
4:05 4:07 MALE: Yeah.  Have fun with the rest of the, the rest of the [unintelligible]. 
4:09 4:09 FEMALE: Thanks.
