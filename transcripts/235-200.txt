1:01 1:06 MALE:  So what does an educational student get to do for fun or does a graduate student actually get to have fun?  

1:07 1:21 FEMALE:  Well, you know, actually I think for grad students, I think we have a pretty healthy, like, you know, social life, so -- yeah I'll go to the city a lot or sometimes [unintelligible] just go to [unintelligible], nothing bad so that you know.  It's easy to get to.  

1:22 1:23 MALE:  [unintelligible].  

1:24 1:35 FEMALE:  Exactly.  I mean, even like, I -- this is like the world of Stanford is, I'm sure it's very easy for people to stay here and like not even go to [unintelligible], so -- so, has that happened to you before?  

1:35 1:36 MALE:  Yeah, you know, --  

1:36 1:36 FEMALE:  There's periods of time.  

1:36 1:39 MALE:  I usually get out of the lab about seven o'clock at night, go home.  

1:39 1:40 FEMALE:  Yeah and you're tired right?  

1:39 1:41 MALE:  Come here about seven o'clock in the morning.  

1:41 1:43 FEMALE:  Oh wow, wow.

2:08 2:09 MALE:  But there's some good ones coming out.

2:20 2:23 MALE:  I lived for here and didn't even realize they had [unintelligible] on campus.  

2:23 2:28 FEMALE:  Oh well because [unintelligible] was undergrad [unintelligible], so I think they're going to have a graduate night or they already did.  

2:29 2:33 MALE:  That's usually the first show.  The early show are usually grad students because they all go to bed early.  

2:34 2:38 FEMALE:  It's true.  Oh my goodness, what a contrast to undergraduate life.  Uh-huh.  

2:39 2:43 MALE:  You know, you think when you're younger, "this would never happen to me" and then you look one day like --  

2:44 2:49 FEMALE:  It happens quickly and it happens [unintelligible] as you go hard it's true, it's true.
