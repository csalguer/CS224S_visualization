FILE NAME: Male Speaker 108 -- Female Speaker 135


0:02 0:05 MALE:  What's the number here?  Okay, let's start.  
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Hi.  I'm female135.  
0:08 0:09 MALE:  I'm male108.  
0:07 0:09 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  
0:12 0:13 MALE:  So, which school are you from?  
0:11 0:17 FEMALE:  Education, and I study higher education.  How about you?  
0:20 0:27 MALE:  I'm from the engineering department, electrical engineering department, and I'm in my third year.  I'm doing my PhD.  You're doing your PhD?  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, I'm doing my first year.  
0:29 0:36 MALE:  So, what exactly is the kind of a topic which [unintelligible] you do like--what do you study actually in the school of education?  
0:34 0:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, I study college teaching. 
0:39 0:39 MALE: oh.  
0:38 0:46 FEMALE:  So, I do research on what teaching methods are most effective in undergraduates.  So, like, you know, is lecture more effective than group discussion, or? 
0:49 0:53 MALE:  But doesn't that depend on totally whether you are teaching philosophy or teaching math or you're teaching engineering?  
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Yes.  
0:55 0:57 MALE:  So, you have a different class for each of these?  
0:55 1:06 FEMALE:  No, no, I don't.  Like I'll probably [unintelligible] on the social sciences because that's my background. Yeah, it definitely varies by, you know, discipline.  
1:08 1:27 MALE:  Right.  Today actually in my class my professor, there was something scribbled, which was of sociology, and we were doing some--it's a math course.  It's a statistics course.  So, he was saying that it's very hard to teach sociology to anybody because there is nothing which you can say this is correct.  Like, why would people agree, right?  
1:25 1:28 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, and like why should students listen to you?  It's [unintelligible].  
1:29 1:29 MALE:  Yeah.
1:28 1:28 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:30 1:40 MALE:  Because in math it's like this is true because I can prove it whether you want to know or not.  So there teaching is like really if you have seen Beautiful Mind it can be done.  
1:38 1:39 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
1:42 1:46 MALE:  Well, that would be your story. You start at that [unintelligible].  
1:44 2:04 FEMALE:  It's funny because I like statistics, and I use [unintelligible] to research a lot.  It was nice in my classes to have like, you know, a couple of classes that are very theoretical and very sort of, you know, about reading a lot.  And then a math class.  So, there's a right answer and a wrong.  You know, it's good to have both at the same time.  I like that.  
2:06 2:15 MALE:   So you actually sit in those classes and see the interaction going on, or how do you study that actually?  A wild camera or something like the CBD people have out.  
2:13 2:23 FEMALE:   Yeah, I mean like you can do the video studies or observation.  I look at student evaluations of, you know, professors and talk to the professors--like the case studies.  
2:25 2:32 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Okay, that's interesting.  So, how many classes did you attend, which you had no idea of? 
2:31 2:32 FEMALE:  As a graduate student or as?  
2:35 2:40 MALE:  No, late--as your research like [unintelligible] math class or something where you had no idea what he's talking about.  
2:39 2:48 FEMALE: Not so much yet because I've mostly been doing like poly sci or sociology or--yeah.  Yeah.  So tell me more about what you're interested in?  
2:51 3:04 MALE:  What I am interested in, like?  Well, I usually generally spend my time doing problem solving [unintelligible].  I like puzzles and all that.  That keeps me interesting because it always keeps your brain working.  
3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
3:05 3:07 MALE:  It's not necessarily doing your research or something like that.  
3:05 3:06 FEMALE:  Right, right.  
3:08 3:18 MALE:  But apart from that I do like hiking or something like we plan a trip and like it's a day hike.  I'm not that rigorous hiking like going on camping or something like that.  
3:16 3:17 FEMALE:  But like a day trip.  
3:19 3:22 MALE: Yeah, like a day trip. It's a good exercise and stuff like that.  
3:20 3:24 FEMALE:  So, tell me about puzzles.  Like do you play board games, or do you--
3:27 3:42 MALE:  No, no, no, puzzles means like just--okay, so something like this.  So, you are in a room like that like there are three bulbs inside and three switches outside.  You can just enter the room once and come out.  Like, how will you find which bulbs are responsive?  
3:40 3:41 FEMALE:  Right, right, logic.  
3:43 3:44 MALE:  Logic puzzles.  
3:42 3:43 FEMALE: Yeah, those are fun.  
3:45 3:47 MALE:  Yeah, something like that.  
3:45 4:01 FEMALE:  Those are--when I was younger I camp counseled at summer camp with little kids.  We'd be on the hike, and I would tell them a logic puzzle so that they would get distracted.  And they would not complain because otherwise they would be like I want a drink. I want lunch.  But, you know, if you get them on the puzzles.  
4:04 4:05 MALE: Okay, nice meeting you.  
4:03 4:04 FEMALE:  It was very nice to meet you.
