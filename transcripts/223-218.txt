0:01 0:03 MALE:  Right on page [unintelligible].   How's it going?  female223 right? 
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, hi, nice to meet you. 
0:05 0:05 MALE:  male218.  
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  male218.  Okay. 
0:07 0:07 MALE:  How's it going? 
0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  Uh, pretty good.  [laughter]  How about you? 
0:08 0:12 MALE:  Pretty well.  I'm just having a really hard time figuring how ambitious people are after a four minute conversation.  
0:13 0:13 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:14 0:17 MALE:  I mean like, if they're already sort of at this university, but I guess it's always just something. 
0:18 0:20 FEMALE:  That's why everybody, I'm kind of like, ambitious, yeah probably they're a 10, yeah.  [laughter] 
0:21 0:24 MALE:  Probably right, I mean even like the biggest, like, even the burn out's here, there' probably not--  
0:25 0:26 FEMALE:  They're still in the 10th percent, like 90th percentile--
0:27 0:28 MALE:  Right.  Exactly, exactly. 
0:29 0:29 FEMALE:  --of ambitiousness and then make that large.  
0:30 0:36 MALE:  That's another thing, they're saying like one out of ten for like Stanford kids, or you saying one out of ten for like, like world population?  
0:37 0:40 FEMALE: Makes you realize the arbitrariness of like, you know, these kind of studies where people--
0:41 0:41 MALE:  Ooh that's a really good point. 
0:41 0:41 FEMALE:  --fill out surveys. 
0:42 0:43 MALE:  I hope they're--make sure that's up near you're mouth so that they caught that one.   
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  [laughter] Yeah.  
0:46 0:47 MALE:  That's a good bit. 
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  I do survey research too, so [laughter]. 
0:49 0:49 MALE:  Oh yeah, what do you do research in? 
0:50 0:50 FEMALE:  Linguistics. 
0:51 0:51 MALE:  Linguistics?  
0:52 0:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:52 0:53 MALE:  Interesting.  What languages like anything in particular? 
0:54 0:56 FEMALE:  Um, recently Japanese. 
0:57 0:58 MALE:  So like Eastern and Asian ones or just, just Japanese?  
0:59 1:03 FEMALE:  Um, Japanese in particular lately.  Um, yeah.  
1:04 1:04 MALE:  Okay.  
1:04 1:05 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:04 1:05 MALE:  Cool.  I actually somewhat do linguistics also. 
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Yeah?  What do you--
1:07 1:09 MALE:  I do, I do Slavic languages in literature.  
1:10 1:10 FEMALE:  Oh okay, wow.  That's cool.  
1:10 1:15 MALE:  So I do, I do Slavic linguistics in Russian literature.  So sort of like cross Slavic--
1:16 1:16 FEMALE:  Okay.  
1:17 1:24 MALE: --literature.  Um, although we say we're a Slavic--we're mostly a Russian department with a couple of opportunities to pick up the odd other Slavic here or there.  
1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:26 1:26 MALE:  So I guess it's more of like an amateur interest for me. 
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Okay. 
1:28 1:28 MALE:  I teach Russian, Russian here, so. 
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh okay. 
1:30 1:33 MALE:  That's been very fun.   Do you do anything like teaching any of the--any other language? With Japanese? 
1:34 1:35 FEMALE:  Um, I used to teach English.  
1:36 1:36 MALE:  Oh yeah?  
1:37 1:37 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
1:37 1:37 MALE:  In Japan? 
1:38 1:38 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:39 1:39 MALE:  I taught Russian in Moscow.  
1:40 1:40 FEMALE:  Oh really? 
1:40 1:40 MALE:  Yeah, how was that--how was that for you?  Were you--
1:42 1:43 FEMALE:  Really fun, I'm dying to go back.  Yeah.  
1:44 1:44 MALE:  Yeah, me too.  
1:45 1:45 FEMALE:  Yeah?  
1:45 1:47 MALE:  Were you--did you spend it in large city or were you--
1:48 1:49 FEMALE:  A city with about 3:00,000, like regional center--
1:50 1:50 MALE:  Okay. 
1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  --like in the middle of nowhere kind of.  Yeah.  
1:53 1:55 MALE:  So in the middle of nowhere, although in Japan its' sort of a little bit hard to get in the middle of nowhere isn't it?  
1:56 1:56 FEMALE:  You'd think--
1:57 1:57 MALE:  You'd thin, uh huh.
1:57 1:59 FEMALE:  --but the cities are so compact that there's actually a lot of middle of nowhere.  
2:00 2:00 MALE:  Interesting.  
2:01 2:01 FEMALE:  Surprising, yeah. 
2:01 2:03 MALE:  Interesting.  I guess after spending time in Russia, almost--
2:04 2:04 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:04 2:05 MALE:  --any other country seems like--
2:06 2:07 FEMALE:  [laughter] Tiny. 
2:08 2:08 MALE:  The middle of nowhere, right, right, the middle of nowhere is like, it's like--
2:09 2:09 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:10 2:10 MALE:  --finding pockets of people who still believe-- 
2:11 2:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:11 2:13 MALE:  That like Lennon is like the premier of Russia.  So.  
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's true.  [laughter]
2:16 2:17 MALE:  Well interesting.  How long did you spend teaching English over there? 
2:18 2:19 FEMALE:  A year.  Yeah, what about you? 
2:20 2:21 MALE:  I spent a year teaching English in Moscow.  So it was one of those things. 
2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:23 2:25 MALE:  Did you guys have a lot of, a lot of Brits? 
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Yeah, I knew a lot of them.  Yeah.  I had a lot of friends that were--
2:27 2:29 MALE:  We had tons of Brits in Moscow.    
2:30 2:30 FEMALE:  Huh. 
2:30 2:31 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  It's a very interesting, it's very interesting sort of pull. 
2:32 2:36 FEMALE:  They take all of-- a lot of Europeans, I think take a year or something between, after they get out of college and then--
2:37 2:37 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:37 2:37 FEMALE:  --just go travel. 
2:38 2:38 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  And that's kind of expected.  
2:39 2:39 MALE:  That's a really smart thing.  
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  They don't really talk about it here.  Yeah.  
2:41 2:45 MALE:  Yeah.  That's a really smart thing.  Because that was, that was, that was a really cool thing that I got to do too.  
2:46 2:46 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
2:46 2:47 MALE:  Did you take it right after you graduated--
2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:48 2:48 MALE:  --from college?  
2:48 2:49 FEMALE:  Uh huh.  
2:49 2:49 MALE:  Where'd go to undergrad?  
2:50 2:50 FEMALE:  Uh, University of Kentucky. 
2:51 2:51 MALE:  Oh Kentucky.  
2:52 2:52 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What about you? 
2:53 2:53 MALE:  I went to Wesley up in Connecticut. 
2:54 2:55 FEMALE:  Okay. 
2:56 2:57 MALE:  I'm originally from Colorado, so it's sort of jump here. 
2:58 2:59 FEMALE:  Okay, you're the third person from Colorado today.  
3:00 3:00 MALE:  Really?  Here, or just in general today? 
3:01 3:02 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Guys here. 
3:03 3:04 MALE:  Oh wow, there's Coloradoans all over the place. 
3:05 3:07 FEMALE:   Yeah.  [laughter] 
3:08 3:08 MALE:  Huh, that's, that's an interesting statistic.  
3:09 3:09 FEMALE:  But I'm the only Kentuckian.  [laughter] 
3:10 3:13 MALE:  Yeah, you're the first Kentuckian I think I've met in, in a while now.  
3:14 3:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, they don't usually make it out to the West Coast.  [laughter] 
3:17 3:21 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  Whereas, whereas with Colorado, its usually the West Coast people make it to Colorado, so. 
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:23 3:25 MALE:  We've usually sort of had our fill with Californians, we're sort of not curious anymore.  
3:26 3:30 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. I've got some friends, some close friends from college that moved to Colorado and really love it.  
3:31 3:31 MALE:  Where to Colorado? 
3:32 3:32 FEMALE:  Boulder. 
3:32 3:33 MALE:  Boulder, that's where I'm from. 
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Oh yeah?  
3:35 3:35 MALE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
3:35 3:37 FEMALE:  Yeah I went and visited when I was on--driving on my way out here-- 
3:38 3:38 MALE:  Nice.   
3:39 3:39 FEMALE:  --from Kentucky.  Yeah it was really nice.  
3:39 3:39 MALE:  How did you like Boulder? 
3:40 3:42 FEMALE:  It's kind of like Berkeley, without the, without the water around it.  
3:43 3:43 MALE:  Yeah.  It's a little like Berkeley, and maybe like a little bit Palo Alto-ish too. 
3:44 3:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, a little bit of Palo Alto--
3:48 3:48 MALE:  Yeah.  
3:49 3:49 FEMALE:  --not quite Berkeley, but--
3:50 3:54 MALE:  Yeah, it's almost like someone took a telegraph of a couple streets and dropped it in the middle of something like Palo Alto--
3:55 3:55 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:55 3:56 MALE:  --and then the people sort of mixed--
3:57 3:57 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
3:57 3:58 MALE:  --and that's what I feel like Boulder is.  
3:59 3:59 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
4:00 4:00 MALE:  Um--
           [horn]
4:01 4:01 MALE:  Okay, well female223, it was very nice to meet you.
