0:43 0:44 MALE:  No offense.  No disrespect, no offense. 
1:09 1:11 FEMALE: It depends on what you like, right, because the--
0:47 0:47 MALE:  Some [laughter].  Right. 
1:12 1:17 FEMALE:  The way the, the weather is, you've got your hot summers, and then you've got the fall with the leaves that turn.  
0:52 0:52 MALE:  Yeah. 
1:17 1:25 FEMALE:  Then you've got cold winters, but you have snow.  And then you have a lot of rain in the spring, and so you kind of appreciate each, each season. 
1:01 1:03 MALE:  Yeah, you are--you have real seasons.  Yes. 
1:27 1:27 FEMALE:  Huh.
1:03 1:04 MALE:  Yes, it's not like here.
1:28 1:29 FEMALE:  Right. 
1:04 1:05 MALE: Here, they just have two seasons.  
1:30 1:38 FEMALE:  Well, here, they say, they can tell when the seasons change.  There's, like, a five degree difference.  And that, like--it's all basically similar. 
1:14 1:18 MALE:  Yeah. It's all the same, yeah.  Either it's raining or not.  [laughter] That's pretty much it.  
1:40 1:44 FEMALE:  Or it's sunny.  Yeah.  What about you?  Where are you from?
1:20 1:20 MALE:  Uh, Paris. 
1:45 1:46 FEMALE:  Paris.  I've been to Paris. 
1:22 1:22 MALE:  Do you like it?
1:47 1:49 FEMALE:  Yeah, I did.  I was there when the leaves were falling. 
1:25 1:25 MALE:  Oh, okay. 
1:50 1:52 FEMALE:  And we walked along the sand.  It was very beautiful. 
1:30 1:31 MALE:  And how, how long did you stay?
1:56 1:57 FEMALE:  I was only there for a couple of days. 
1:33 1:34 MALE:  Okay.  That's good.  
1:58 1:59 FEMALE:  I'm sorry.  It was just a mini-vacation. 
1:35 1:38 MALE:  That's enough.  You, you had enough time to visit some stuff?
2:03 2:08 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Um, we did quite a lot, actually.  We--the first day, we took, and we walked all the way around the city. 
1:40 1:40 MALE:  Yes. 
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  We started down at the Bastille.
1:43 1:43 MALE:  Okay. 
2:11 2:20 FEMALE:  And walked over to the Eiffel Tower, hitting a couple of things along the way, and then up to Saint, uh--not Saint Chapel.  Um, Sacre Coeur.
1:55 1:57 MALE:  Uh, Sacre Coeur.  Yes. 
2:21 2:26 FEMALE:  And then we had to take the Metro back because by the time we got up there, we were really tired. [laughter] 
2:02 2:02 MALE:  Okay. [laughter]  
2:26 2:27 FEMALE:  It was quite a day. 
2:04 2:07 MALE:  Yeah, yeah.  It's a long journey, but it's, it's city, though, Paris.  I mean, you can--
2:32 2:36 FEMALE:  It's beautiful.  I mean, you see the city much better when you walk around rather than--
2:12 2:22 MALE:  Yeah, when you--well, it's really cool, but it's, it's pretty cool when you're a tourist and you visit.  But when you live there, it's a lot of traffic jam.  People are always mad.  
2:46 2:46 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
2:22 2:25 MALE:  And, the, the Parisians are not very friendly, so--
2:50 2:52 FEMALE:  I, uh, I, I spent some time in London, actually. 
2:28 2:28 MALE:  Oh, okay. 
2:52 3:03 FEMALE:  About a year, so that's why I took the trip over to Paris.  So I, I can understand that because, like, I was in London, and I think it's a great place to visit, but I don't think I'd want to live there again.  
2:40 2:42 MALE:  There's, there's a lot of traffic jam, or--
3:07 3:16 FEMALE:  There are.  Actually, there were days when they--what did they do?  They closed the subway, the closed the tube, and basically, whether the light was green or not, you were stopped.  
2:52 2:52 MALE:  Oh. 
3:17 3:20 FEMALE: And I could walk anywhere I wanted because the cars weren't moving. 
2:57 2:57 MALE:  Okay. 
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  But, yeah. 
2:59 3:01 MALE:  You were--you were in London for study or--
3:25 3:28 FEMALE:  For studying, yeah.  About, uh, two or three years ago. 
3:04 3:04 MALE:  Okay. 
3:29 3:30 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
3:06 3:06 MALE:  And, in what field are you?
3:31 3:33 FEMALE:  Well, um, I'm studying immunology. 
3:09 3:12 MALE:  Immune--okay.  Oh, there's a lot of people from the med school.
3:36 3:38 FEMALE:  Really?  I haven't met any of them, yet. 
3:15 3:18 MALE:  There, there is two, two other women from the med school. 
3:42 3:42 FEMALE:  Oh. 
3:18 3:22 MALE:  And one in Biology and one in, uh, Urology and [unintelligible], something like that.  
3:46 3:48 FEMALE:  Well, see, maybe that's why 'cause they're all women.  
3:24 3:24 MALE:  [laughter]
3:48 3:50 FEMALE:  I haven't met any of the women yet. 
3:24 3:30 MALE:  Okay.  Uh, uh, okay.  I just met three women from the med school.  I don't know if all the guys. 
3:53 3:56 FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  I think she's from--in Biology, too. 
3:32 3:36 MALE:  Okay.  So, so where did you say you were from in Biology?
4:00 4:01 FEMALE:  Immunology. 
3:37 3:37 MALE:  Immunology.  Okay. 
4:02 4:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So studying how your body responds to disease and--
3:39 3:39 MALE:  Yes. 
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  What about you?
3:42 3:44 MALE:  Uh, I'm, uh, I'm doing research--
4:08 4:08 FEMALE:  Um hm. 
3:44 3:45 MALE:  In solar physics. 
4:10 4:12 FEMALE:  Wow.  That's cool.  So what do you do? 
3:48 4:00 MALE: Uh, basically, I spend my day behind a computer [laughter], and I do, uh, solar models.  So I try to model the physics of the sun, how the sun produces energy and this kind of stuff. 
4:24 4:26 FEMALE:  So what are the applications?
4:02 4:06 MALE:  Uh, it's [unintelligible] research, so [laughter].
4:31 4:32 FEMALE:  Oh. 
4:08 4:12 MALE:  [unintelligible] application that's, uh--well, it's interesting, though.  Yeah, yeah. 
4:35 4:39 FEMALE:  It sound interesting.  Physics is amazingly interesting. Well, it was nice to meet you, male302. 
4:16 4:16 MALE:  Okay.  Yes.  It was nice to meet you.
