01:05  01:21	MALE:  So I think you're more organized and ah you like to prepare things before and France [unintelligible] is a bit a mess and ah, things are -- we discover things at the last moment.  So --
01:22  01:23	FEMALE:  So you're more spontaneous.  
01:23  01:23	MALE:  Ah --
01:24  01:29	FEMALE:  You find yourself more spontaneous than the average American?
01:30  01:52	MALE:  I wouldn't say that.  Different, I don't know less -- I'm sorry it's difficult, but for some things yes, I think.  But, ah, they are also um, things in America which are most spontaneous, I like this way, you know.  I wasn't really clear, I'm sorry, but.
01:53  01:55	FEMALE:  No, no, it's perfectly clear.
01:56  01:56	MALE:  It's difficult to.
01:57  01:59	FEMALE:  I wouldn't do half as well in French so.  
02:00  02:01	MALE:  Yes, you have learned French?
02:01  02:06	FEMALE:  I took it in high school, but I refuse to speak it in front of anyone who speaks it well.  Because I'm very bad at it.
02:07  02:08	MALE:  No.  I speak English in front of you.
02:08  02:10	FEMALE:  I -- no you speak it very well.  
02:11  02:11	MALE:  Ah --
02:12  02:17	FEMALE:  Well, yeah, but you came here if I went off to France you know, I would be in the same position.  So I stay here [laughter] so.
02:18  02:20	MALE:  I know, yes I think it is difficult, but it's -- no I really enjoy it.
02:21  02:22	FEMALE: Yeah.  
02:23  02:31	MALE:  It's a good way to learn the language and this is such an amazing place.  You know Stanford, California.  So I'm really happy to be here.
02:32  02:33	FEMALE:  Yeah.
02:34  02:36	MALE:  I think it's truly a good experimentation to go to another country and to meet people.  You should try it.
02:37  02:52	FEMALE:  I'm too conventional, I can't do it.  I went to Paris once though and I liked it.  I was only there for a few days, but quite lovely.  That's my experience in France.
02:53  02:54	MALE:  And did you like it?
02:53  03:09	FEMALE:  I did like it.  It was good, the coffee was good, the wine was good.  I spoke Arabic at the time and so I met a lot of Moroccans that was fun.  The art was fantastic, beautiful city.  No complaints.  It was a little cold.
03:10  03:11	MALE:  Yes.
03:12  03:13	FEMALE:  I was there in the spring.
03:13  03:14	MALE:  Compared to this place, of course its cold, yes.
03:14  03:15	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, so.
03:16  03:37	MALE:  Actually in the South of France it's hotter than here.  But Paris is too cold.  I don't really -- I don't like the weather in Paris.  So, I mean I study in Paris, but I'm not from Paris and I'm really sad in Paris.  The city is beautiful, but I really think it's a wonderful place to visit, but not to live in.  I don't feel like it.
03:38  03:39	FEMALE:  Right.  And what part are you from did you say?  I'm sorry.
03:40  03:41	MALE:  No I didn't, I'm from Leone.
03:45  03:47	FEMALE:  From where?  Leone.  Which is?
03:48  03:48	MALE:  Um, no --
03:49  03:50	FEMALE:  Parish, that's France.
03:51  03:52	MALE:  Yeah, you know [unintelligible].
03:53  03:53	FEMALE:  Yeah.
03:57  03:58	MALE:  Yes it's between Paris and [unintelligible]. 
03:58  03:59	FEMALE:  Okay.
03:59  04:02	MALE:  So just in the middle of France, between these.
04:03  04:05	FEMALE:  Cool.  So have you done speed dating before or is this your first experiment.
04:06  04:06	MALE:  No.
04:07  04:09	FEMALE:  Mine too.  What do you think of it?
04:10  04:14	MALE:  For me it's kind of strange, yes [horn] oh.
