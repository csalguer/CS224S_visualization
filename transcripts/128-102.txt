FILE NAME: Male Speaker 102 -- Female Speaker 128

0:07 0:07 FEMALE:  Hey.
0:04 0:04 MALE:  Hi.
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  I'm female128.
0:06 0:06 MALE:  male102.  
0:09 0:10 FEMALE:  male102, hi.
0:06 0:07 MALE:  Nice to meet you female128.  
0:11 0:12 FEMALE:  I--I think I've met you before.
0:10 0:10 MALE:  Really.  
0:13 0:15 FEMALE:  I have this vague, vague recollection.
0:12 0:14 MALE:  It's possible.  Where would we have met?  
0:17 0:18 FEMALE:  I have no idea.  
0:15 0:16 MALE:  What program are you in?  
0:19 0:21 FEMALE:  I'm in earth sciences.  
0:19 0:19 MALE:  Really?  
0:22 0:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:20 0:20 MALE:  I'm in the ed school.  
0:23 0:26 FEMALE:  Okay, maybe through nameX--nameX.  
0:25 0:29 MALE:  It's possible.  I know--I certainly know her, but I don't know.  
0:32 0:39 FEMALE:  It may be--this is just like far reaching.  Did you go to the concert at the little penthouse place in the city with some people from Berkley?  
0:37 0:39 MALE:  Yes, I did.  With--I went with Noah.
0:43 0:43 FEMALE:  With Noah.
0:40 0:40 MALE:  Yes.
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  Yeah, I met Noah with her.
0:42 0:42 MALE:  Okay.  
0:46 0:46 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:43 0:44 MALE:  Because she's a scientist person.  
0:47 0:48 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
0:44 0:45 MALE:  So, that's probably where I saw you there.  
0:48 0:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, well, nameX is my roommate.  
0:47 0:48 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:52 0:55 FEMALE:  So, this is how I'm here, and that's, yeah, how I would know.  
0:54 0:54 MALE:  Cool.  
0:57 0:59 FEMALE:  So, there we go.  
0:57 1:00 MALE:  So, what--what--you're a doctoral student in the earth sciences?  
1:03 1:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, I am.  
1:01 1:02 MALE:  And what year?  You're second year?  
1:06 1:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:03 1:03 MALE:  Cool.  
1:06 1:07 FEMALE:  Yeah.  What about you?
1:04 1:07 MALE:  Second year doctoral student in education.  
1:10 1:11 FEMALE:  Okay, what kind of research do you do?  
1:08 1:12 MALE:  I do weird stuff.  I do philosophy of education.  
1:15 1:17 FEMALE:  My stuff is so straightforward and non-esoteric.
1:15 1:20 MALE:  Yeah, mine is very strange.  So, it's looking at the philosophy of education research.  
1:23 1:25 FEMALE:  Okay, so what's your philosophy?  
1:23 1:24 MALE:  My philosophy?  
1:27 1:28 FEMALE:  Your philosophy for education.  
1:26 2:04 MALE:  Uh, what's interesting--I mean I have different thoughts on that, but it's--that's actually not the sort of philosophy of education I do.  Like, some people think about the goals of education and spend a lot of time, and they read a lot of John Dooey [phonetic] and a lot of, uh, George S. Counce [phonetic] and a lot of that sort of stuff.  What I do is think about how we should study education and think about the roles that values, and politics, and different beliefs play and affect research methods, which happens all the time now particularly in environmental sciences, too, in a lot of things that are going on--how global warming research is being used and sided in different ways and manipulated.  
2:06 2:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:05 2:06 MALE:  That's the sort of stuff I'm going to consider.  
2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  Cool.  That's really neat.  
2:08 2:12 MALE:  It's--I think it's very interesting.  It's a big issue with education policy like environmental policy. 
2:16 2:16 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
2:15 2:18 MALE:  Cool.  What area or niche of research do you do?  
2:20 2:22 FEMALE:  I do near surface geophysics.  
2:20 2:20 MALE:  Near?  
2:24 2:24 FEMALE:  Surface geophysics.  
2:22 2:23 MALE:  Near surface geophysics.  
2:26 2:30 FEMALE:  I'm looking at ways to [unintelligible] magnetic resonance.  
2:28 2:28 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:31 2:38 FEMALE:  Which is like [unintelligible] and MRI to monitor chemical changes in concomitant [unintelligible].  
2:36 2:40 MALE:  Really?  Specifically, whether it's water, or land, or devastation?  
2:43 2:44 FEMALE:  Uhm, land, land.  
2:42 2:42 MALE:  Land.  
2:45 2:50 FEMALE:  Basically, [unintelligible].  Do you know Hanford [phonetic] at all?  
2:48 2:50 MALE:  Is it a person or a place?  
2:53 3:06 FEMALE:  No.  Okay, it's big--it's surface [unintelligible] actually of Washington.  [unintelligible] and make your country [unintelligible] and [unintelligible].  
3:02 3:02 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:07 3:12 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  
3:09 3:09 MALE:  Right.  
3:14 3:25 FEMALE:  Take for ground, and so now it's taking [unintelligible] ground, and they don't really know what to do with it.  So, they're looking for ways to remediate and even [unintelligible].  You can file like [unintelligible] committee or things like pumping different chemicals into the ground--
3:22 3:22 MALE:  [interposing]  Uh-huh.  
3:25 3:35 FEMALE:  --trying to force a reaction, but they don't have a good way of imaging what's happening with these contaminants.  And so I'm basically looking at new ways to image that kind of thing.  
3:32 3:36 MALE:  And the idea is this would be an easy way to collect a lot of data on a lot of different stuff--
3:38 3:38 FEMALE:  [interposing]  Yeah.  
3:36 3:39 MALE:  --without having to do like core samples or.
3:41 3:43 FEMALE:  Drill, exactly, having to drill down.
3:41 3:41 MALE:  Huh.  
3:44 3:46 FEMALE:  Take a sample, say okay this is what we've got here.  
3:42 3:48 MALE:  Yeah, and do you get a lot of--can you--I mean do you really get a lot of information from--
3:52 4:06 FEMALE:  [interposing]  It's really in the development stages so far so I haven't applied it to a field application at all.  I've just been working in my lab and little chemical changes that are occurring in [unintelligible] that I've created.  So, in my lab it works really well, but I don't know what will happen.  
4:05 4:08 MALE:  [laughter]  Yeah, it always is more--a question what it will look like in practice.  
4:11 4:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
4:09 4:10 MALE:  Well, it was very nice meeting you, female128.  
4:13 4:13 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you too. 
4:11 4:11 MALE:  Take care.
