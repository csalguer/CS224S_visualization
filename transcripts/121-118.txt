0:09 0:10 MALE: Hi, my name's male118.

0:07 0:09 FEMALE: Hi, I'm female121, nice to meet you.

0:10 0:11 MALE: Nice to meet you.

0:10 0:15 FEMALE: Um, so heard her.  I'm going to take her questions.  So what do you do for fun?  [laughter] 

0:18 0:23 MALE: Uh well I'm currently trying to get out running every day for like a half hour, like 45 minutes.

0:22 0:22 FEMALE: Excellent.

0:24 0:26 MALE: I'm going to run the Bay to Breakers race.

0:24 0:25 FEMALE: You are?

0:27 0:31 MALE: Because I've heard that it's like a blast and is like really fun so I'm signed up for that.  Yeah.

0:28 0:31 FEMALE: It's supposed to be really fun.  Oh good, good.

0:33 0:37 MALE: So I'm like kind of training for that, kind of just having fun because I  like running, so yeah.

0:34 0:37 FEMALE: Uh huh, uh huh.  Have you been running with the Stanford Running Club?

0:39 0:41 MALE: Uh yeah, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I do that.

0:39 0:40 FEMALE: Really?

0:41 0:43 MALE: Otherwise I just go by myself.

0:41 0:41 FEMALE: Is it fun?

0:44 0:49 MALE: Uh, well I enjoy running so [unintelligible] is fun but I mean, the people are all nice so--

0:47 0:47 FEMALE: They are.

0:50 0:50 MALE: Yeah.

0:48 1:03 FEMALE: Yeah, I'm signed up for it but I have never [laughter] gotten myself.  I'm kind of a loner when I run so it's like, it would be fun to go as a group and go to a different place that I don't know to go but I'm--when it comes time to go running I just end up going by myself.

1:05 1:10 MALE: Yeah, I basically know like no good running routes so it helped me a lot to like, to see like some of the stuff that they had.

1:09 1:09 FEMALE: I bet.

1:11 1:12 MALE: Yeah.

1:10 1:11 FEMALE: I cheat and take them off of their web site.

1:13 1:15 MALE: [laughter] Oh really?

1:12 1:14 FEMALE: So then I still don't have to go.  [laughter] 

1:16 1:17 MALE: They actually have them up there?

1:15 1:16 FEMALE: They post everything up there, yeah.

1:18 1:18 MALE: Oh.

1:17 1:17 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.

1:19 1:20 MALE: I didn't even know that, but--

1:18 1:20 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  So your next time--

1:21 1:25 MALE: I still, I still, I still like running with them though so I'll keep doing it but-- 

1:22 1:29 FEMALE: Fun.  I'll have to get out there.  I know I filled the form out and everything and I had never gone so yeah.  Anything else?

1:31 1:38 MALE: Uh, I don't know.  Although I just like standard stuff, just like reading, or playing video games like guys always like. 

1:36 1:37 FEMALE: [laughter] 

1:39 1:44 MALE: Basically I mean I like any sporting activity or like physical activity and all that stuff like that.

1:41 1:43 FEMALE: Uh huh.  This is a great place for that.

1:46 1:48 MALE: Yeah.  Because the weather is always nice so--

1:46 1:48 FEMALE: Especially now.  Finally.

1:50 1:53 MALE: You never have to pack up or anything or stop.

1:51 1:53 FEMALE: Uh huh, uh huh, are you from somewhere where the weather--?

1:56 1:57 MALE: Well I'm from outside Chicago.

1:55 1:57 FEMALE: Oh okay, oh so this is heaven.

2:00 2:02 MALE: [laughter] Yeah, we have disaster winters over there, wet.

2:00 2:01 FEMALE: I'm sure.

2:03 2:06 MALE: As with probably most of the United States, so--

2:04 2:13 FEMALE: I'm from the northeast so it gets mighty cold up there too, so this is like--  Even when people are complaining and wearing wool hats and it's raining, and I'm like, you don't have any idea of what you're talking about.

2:15 2:20 MALE: Yeah, seriously.  Yeah like what like low 60's or something during the winter.  [laughter] 

2:16 2:22 FEMALE: [laughter] And they're all bundled.  [laughter]  It's pretty sad.  [laughter]  Um, so what do you study?

2:25 2:27 MALE: Uh, aeronautics and astronautics.

2:24 2:27 FEMALE: Wow.  Amazing.

2:29 2:30 MALE: What about you?

2:28 2:29 FEMALE: I'm in the ed school here.

2:31 2:31 MALE: Oh okay.

2:30 2:36 FEMALE: So it's a whole different--it's a whole different side of campus.  I don't venture over there very often.

2:37 2:42 MALE: Oh I know.  I, I've only come across like engineers basically like all the time.

2:40 2:41 FEMALE: I know.

2:43 2:45 MALE: That's where all the buildings are and just everything so--

2:42 2:46 FEMALE: I know.  They should do a better job of getting, finding ways.

2:47 2:51 MALE: I know, of integrating it, yeah, that's true.  I agree with that.

2:48 2:54 FEMALE: Because people are doing amazing stuff on both sides and I couldn't even tell you what half of the departments over there.

2:56 3:02 MALE: Oh yeah.  You just start--you even like begin to forget that there even are other ones.  I don't know I just--

2:58 3:01 FEMALE: [laughter] Well you're busy.

3:03 3:03 MALE: Yeah.

3:01 3:05 FEMALE: Doing what you do.  Excellent.  Are you a doctoral student?

3:07 3:11 MALE: Uh no, I'm actually going to finish after my masters and just--

3:08 3:10 FEMALE: Mm hmm. Is it two years?

3:12 3:16 MALE: Uh well it depends.  It's 45 units so however.

3:14 3:15 FEMALE: However long it takes?

3:17 3:18 MALE: However long, yeah.

3:16 3:18 FEMALE: How long do you want to [laughter] 

3:20 3:24 MALE: Oh, in general I think two years is kind of like the max.  Because you'd have to--

3:22 3:23 FEMALE: Be really slow.

3:25 3:29 MALE: Or something.  So--to not finish by then.

3:25 3:30 FEMALE: Yeah, we do 45 units in three quarters here so--

3:30 3:36 MALE: Yeah, okay, well that's possible for the engineering but people don't usually do that, so--

3:34 3:47 FEMALE: It's too intensive.  If I could afford to stay longer then I would but I already know it's going to be hard enough to pay it back when I get out of here.  If I stayed any longer I would be kicking myself later, so--  But that's amazing.

3:50 3:52 MALE: So you're actually done at the end of this quarter then?

3:50 4:04 FEMALE: Yeah, shocking.  It's like I'm really looking forward to it and I'm also totally terrified because I haven't found a job yet [horn] so--  Was that it?  Oh that was fast.  Have fun.

4:07 4:07 MALE: Thanks.
