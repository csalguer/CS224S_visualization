00:02 00:03 FEMALE: Oh, my gosh.  
00:11 00:15 MALE: I guess really want first impressions.  Zero impressions.  Anyway, um, what's you name?  
00:13 00:14 FEMALE: It's female330.  
00:16 00:17 MALE: female330?  Hi.  
00:14 00:17 FEMALE: Hi.  Thank you.  
00:20 00:21 MALE: Um, so, what do you do?  
00:20 00:22 FEMALE: Uh, I--I said this so many times by now it sounds like something--
00:25 00:27 MALE: So you want to have an unusual conversation.  
00:24 00:25 FEMALE: Yeah, a little.  
00:27 00:28 MALE: What's the last book you read?
00:26 00:26 FEMALE: The last what?  
00:29 00:30 MALE: Book you read?  
00:28 00:30 FEMALE: Um, technical or nontechnical?  
00:33 00:35 MALE: Nontechnical.  Are you French?  Do you have a French accent?  
00:32 00:34 FEMALE: No, it's Spanish.  I'm from Argentina.  
00:38 00:39 MALE: Okay.  That's unusual.  
00:36 00:39 FEMALE: Think that is unusual?  So we can talk about that more.  
00:42 00:43 MALE: Okay.  Great.  
00:40 00:46 FEMALE: But last book I read, um, I'm reading the biography of an Argentinean author, the [unintelligible].
00:49 00:49 MALE: Okay.  
00:46 01:00 FEMALE: Uh, which is super fun because he's one of the really renown authors in Argentina and this is his diary with all the notes about, um, like authors, you know, uh, writers that were from his time and he's telling all this--
01:03 01:04 MALE: What was his time?  When was his era?  
01:03 01:06 FEMALE: Uh, he probably died only a few years ago.  
01:09 01:11 MALE: Oh, okay.  So basically like mid 20th Century.  
01:09 01:09 FEMALE: Yeah.  
01:12 01:12 MALE: Okay.  
01:10 01:11 FEMALE: What do you study?  
01:14 01:15 MALE: Um, electrical engineering.  
01:12 01:13 FEMALE: Okay.  
01:16 01:16 MALE: Yeah.  
01:13 01:14 FEMALE: All right.  
01:17 01:18 MALE: Yeah, I can do basic arithmetic.  [laughter] 
01:16 01:18 FEMALE: I thought you were going to talk about literature or something.  
01:21 01:23 MALE: I mean, I was an English major as an undergrad, so...
01:21 01:23 FEMALE: See, I knew it.  I saw it in your eyes.  
01:26 01:30 MALE: Oh, well.  I have some degree of humanity.  Not like most of the engineers. 
01:26 01:29 FEMALE: How did you go from English to double E?  
01:32 01:40 MALE: I was actually a double major.  English is my [unintelligible] for graduate, so.  I mean, I wanted to be a writer but practicality, you know, it got the best of me.  
01:37 01:41 FEMALE: Okay.  Don't say that for something like this.  I'm an English major.
01:45 01:46 MALE: Are you?  
01:44 01:52 FEMALE: No, you just stated.  I'm telling you the secret.  The strategy.  I'm an English major and I want to be a writer and on the side I'm electrical engineer because, like, you know--
01:56 01:56 MALE: Actually, that pays the bills.  
01:53 01:59 FEMALE: Math--no, math is really easy for me.  I do that, but it's not really my passion.  But I am really a writer in my heart.  
02:02 02:04 MALE: Actually, I am a writer.  I mean, I write a blog.  
02:01 02:05 FEMALE: You can't do this with me, now.  [Crosstalk]
02:08 02:25 MALE: It actually happens to be true, though.  I do write a blog and the blog gets a lot of visitors, but I write anonymously because [unintelligible] you know, say whatever I want to say without any, you know, anybody from work reading it.  So it's something and I'm pursuing it.  Um, but, uh, yes, uh, unfortunately you know my secret, so...
02:22 02:23 FEMALE: That's great, though.  
02:26 02:34 MALE: But, uh, so what are you, um, so now let's, let's get the background.  What's your, uh, department you're majoring in?  
02:30 02:32 FEMALE: I'm a, um, in earth sciences.  
02:36 02:37 MALE: Earth sciences, okay.  
02:33 02:35 FEMALE: So my background is in chemical engineering.
02:39 02:41 MALE: Oh, great I have a master's in chemical engineering.
02:40 02:41 FEMALE: Now that [unintelligible] like me.  
02:45 02:47 MALE: Yeah, exactly.  I'm a life student and stuff.  
02:44 02:56 FEMALE: Okay.  I keep--so an undergrad in chemi, uh, grad masters in civil and environmental and now--and my program is interdisciplinary so I took on some anthropology, sociology.   
03:00 03:01 MALE: What's that program?  
02:57 02:57 FEMALE: It's IPER.  
03:02 03:02 MALE: Okay.  What's that?
02:58 03:01 FEMALE: It's an interdisciplinary program in environment and resources.  
03:06 03:09 MALE: So that idea is to bash in environmental regulation appropriately or?  
03:05 03:15 FEMALE: You can do whatever you want.  It's really great.  So I'm doing social entrepreneurship.  Issues of this course I'm [unintelligible] related to water project in developing countries.  
03:19 03:28 MALE: Huh, that's interesting.  Are you involved with that, uh, there was a bunch of recent films that were shown on water and so on, on campus.  
03:23 03:24 FEMALE: Documentary?  
03:28 03:29 MALE: Yeah.  
03:25 03:28 FEMALE: I was not involved with that but I, I've been to a couple.  
03:32 03:33 MALE: Okay, okay.  
03:29 03:40 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are the issues that I studied, but now I want to temper it with a different angle.  I got bored of my engineering because I was studying, like, you know, filters and low-cost devices.  
03:43 03:48 MALE: You've gone from that to kind of more of a writing, rhetorical literary technique.  
03:44 03:45 FEMALE: Yeah.  
03:49 03:52 MALE: Good.  So are you getting your--you're doing your Ph.D. now?  
03:49 03:50 FEMALE: Right.  Trying to.  
03:55 03:58 MALE: Trying to.  Um, so, are you of Japanese ancestry?  
03:55 03:56 FEMALE: No.  You know what--
04:00 04:02 MALE: Because I know there's a large Japanese migration to South America and so one of the--
03:59 04:00 FEMALE: That's right.  Yeah.  No, I'm Korean.  
MALE: Oh, great.  
04:06 04:10 04:02 04:05 FEMALE: But everybody thinks I'm Japanese or Chinese.  I don't know why, but--
04:10 04:16 MALE: Well, Japanese would be a good guess because of all the Japanese who went to South America, but, you know.  Have you tried alllooksame.com [phonetic]?  
04:13 04:16 FEMALE: I suck at it.  I get, like, ones.  I'm really bad.  
04:21 04:22 MALE: Try that, it's fun.  Anyway--
04:17 04:20 FEMALE: No, I did and I got really low scores.  
04:24 04:25 MALE: Okay.  
04:20 04:22 FEMALE: I'm super bad in recognizing people.  
04:26 04:28 MALE: Yeah, me too, but, hey, anyway, nice meeting you.  
04:24 04:25 FEMALE: Nice meeting you.  Good luck.
