00:02 00:03 FEMALE: Hi.  How are you?  
00:06 00:07 MALE: Fine.  How are you?

00:08 00:08 MALE: Uh, [unintelligible].
00:06 00:07 FEMALE: [unintelligible]?
00:09 00:09 MALE: [unintelligible].
00:07 00:09 FEMALE: I'm female330.  Nice to meet you.  
00:14 00:15 MALE: I see you have only one C in it?  
00:13 00:20 FEMALE: Oh, yeah, you noticed. Um, it's Spanish.  I'm from Argentina.  So in Spanish you write female330 with only one C.
00:24 00:25 MALE: Did you grow up there?
00:23 00:24 FEMALE: Hm?  I'm sorry?  
00:28 00:28 MALE: Which city?
00:27 00:42 FEMALE: In Argentina.  Buenos Aires.  The capital city, yeah.  It's, um, a third of the country lives in Buenos Aires so most likely when you meet somebody from Argentina here in the States, it will be basically, um--
00:45 00:46 MALE: Buenos Aires.  
00:44 00:45 FEMALE: Yeah.  That's right.  So you're from?  
00:49 00:50 MALE: China.  
00:47 00:49 FEMALE: China.  Okay.  What are you doing here?  
00:52 00:55 MALE: Um, I'm doing a Ph.D. in physics here.  
00:52 00:53 FEMALE: Okay.  What lab?  
00:57 01:02 MALE: Uh, [unintelligible] there's no science lab, so I'm doing microphysics.  
00:59 01:03 FEMALE: Oh, medical firms.  That's interesting.  So what are you working on?  
01:06 01:33 MALE: Uh, I work on combining two [unintelligible] systems to have a hybrid system.  One is MR and the other one is X-Ray, um, so, um, by having a hybrid system some [unintelligible] procedures can benefit from such a system.  My work is to understand how the systems will deal with each other and, uh, trying to come up with a solution for them. 
01:30 01:32 FEMALE: Okay.  Oh, what year are you?  
01:36 01:41 MALE: Uh, I've been here for more than five years, so.  In about five years.  
01:37 01:41 FEMALE: Okay.  And, uh, academia or English [unintelligible]?
01:45 01:56 MALE: I'm trying to find a job in research lab, uh, a big company.  So I'd like to work on research.    
01:52 01:55 FEMALE: Okay.  Like which companies would have enough [unintelligible]?  
01:58 02:02 MALE: Uh, like, G.E. or Phillips, Siemens.
01:59 02:03 FEMALE: Okay.  You should go to Germany and Siemens.  
02:06 02:11 MALE: Um, they also have some research labs here in the States.  
02:08 02:09 FEMALE: I know.  
02:14 02:15 MALE: You should come to [unintelligible].
02:13 02:16 FEMALE: I'm in a program called IPER, I-P-E-R.  
02:20 02:21 MALE: IPER?  
02:17 02:41 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's within the earth sciences department and IPER stands for Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.  So I work with water projects in developing countries.  Um, and I study social entrepreneurship.  So...  Second year, getting my proposal ready so it's kind of stressful now.  
02:44 02:45 MALE: A lot of work.  
02:42 02:44 FEMALE: Oh, yeah.  I'm tired.  
02:47 02:50 MALE: You don't have much time for fun.  
02:47 02:59 FEMALE: No.  Not this quarter.  Like, it's been really good up until last quarter, but this quarter has been pretty, you know, work all the time.  But vacation is coming up, right?  
03:04 03:04 MALE: Right.  
03:00 03:01 FEMALE: It's almost June.  
03:05 03:07 MALE: Do you tend to go back home in the summer?  
03:04 03:15 FEMALE: I usually do.  So I'm going to go to Guatemala this summer and then I'm going to go to probably Argentina for a week or something and then work for the rest of the summer in Seattle.  
03:20 03:22 MALE: So it's winter in Argentina right now.  
03:19 03:49 FEMALE: That's right.  Yeah.  So it's a bummer.  I think last year, actually, I spent the whole year in winter because I--when it was summer here I was traveling in South America and in Africa and in both places it was winter.  When I came back I went to Seattle and it rained for all the time, like, every day, every frigging day it rained.  So I missed out on summer last year.  Like it really affects me.  I like summer and the beach and, you know, the sun, and no clouds of any kind.  
03:53 03:58 MALE: Yeah, we do not have a lot of rain here in the summer.  Rain is, uh, is mostly in the winter.    
03:55 04:00 FEMALE: Exactly.  Although the spring [unintelligible] I hate it.  
04:06 04:07 MALE: Very nice to meet you.  
04:02 04:06 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.  Yeah.  Good luck with your program.  Yeah, have fun.
