1:28 1:28 FEMALE:  Solar?

1:21 1:22 MALE:  Yeah, solar.

1:29 1:30 FEMALE:  Oh, interesting.

1:23 1:33 MALE:  Yeah, and I--but I--but I have a thick French accent and I'm afraid it can never disappear.  I've already been there two years--here two years and each time I say solar physics people don't understand.

1:41 1:41 FEMALE:  Oh, what?

1:33 1:35 MALE:  So, it's more like solar physics.

1:42 1:45 FEMALE:  Solar, yeah, but--well, I took French for two years.

1:38 1:39 MALE:  Oh.

1:46 1:48 FEMALE:  But I only can count one to ten so.

1:41 1:41 MALE:  You what?  You what?

1:49 1:51 FEMALE:  I can only count one to ten after two years of French.

1:44 1:45 MALE:  Okay.  Yeah.  When was that?

1:53 1:57 FEMALE:  That was in college, quite along time ago.  And I'm a post doc too.

1:49 1:51 MALE:  Oh, okay, you're a post doc in this department?

1:59 2:04 FEMALE:  In dev bio because I'm in development [unintelligible] biology.  But I didn't do anything in developmental biology.  I--I study bacteria.

1:57 1:58 MALE:  Oh, you study bacteria.

2:05 2:07 FEMALE:  Yeah, because my degree is in microbiology.

2:00 2:00 MALE:  I see.  Okay.

2:09 2:10 FEMALE:  And I got it from Michigan.

2:03 2:04 MALE:  Okay.

2:12 2:12 FEMALE:  Yup, so...

2:04 2:06 MALE:  Oh, so you have been in the US for a long time?

2:13 2:19 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's why--yeah, I--I was in Wisconsin for three years and Michigan for eight years and almost four years here.

2:11 2:12 MALE:  Wow.

2:19 2:22 FEMALE:  I wanted to go to college [unintelligible] that's why.

2:14 2:16 MALE:  I'm--I guess you prefer California?

2:24 2:27 FEMALE:  Oh, yes.  Weather, yes, definitely.

2:20 2:23 MALE:  [laughter].  [unintelligible] yeah, there's no comparison I guess with a...

2:30 2:44 FEMALE:  No, and I think if I can't find a job here, I'll stay here at least for a few years at least.  Yeah, I--I don't know.  I haven't decided yet.  I might move home eventually, but I don't mind staying here.  How about you 'cause I--I know most Europeans they would move back to Europe eventually.

2:37 2:37 MALE:  Oh, okay.  Yeah--well, yeah.

2:45 2:46 FEMALE:  Most of the people I know were--

2:39 2:41 MALE:  I--I just refused a job in Franco so.

2:48 2:49 FEMALE:  You--you what?

2:42 2:45 MALE:  But I just refused a job--I got a solid position in France and I--

2:51 2:52 FEMALE:  Oh, I'm sorry.

2:45 2:49 MALE:  I don't know.  I have no idea, but I'm happy [unintelligible].  I prefer to stay here.
 
2:56 2:56 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.

2:49 3:02 MALE:  So, I refused the job.  So, now I--I--I hope I won't be fired from the lab because I have no--nobody [unintelligible] to France anymore, so I'm more or less stuck in the US.

3:10 3:12 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  So--and--but you like fine?

3:04 3:06 MALE:  Yeah, I like it.

3:13 3:15 FEMALE:  And you want to stay in the area I in California?

3:08 3:14 MALE:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  My plan is to stay as long as possible in the Bay Area.  This is the best part of the world as we know it.

3:23 3:25 FEMALE:  I think so too like the weather you can't--you can't beat it.

3:17 3:18 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's very nice.

3:26 3:31 FEMALE:  And even if you--if you want snow to go up to Tahoe in the summer and if you like the beach, you can go to Monterey.

3:22 3:28 MALE:  And there's--and San Francisco is big enough that you have museums and opera.

3:36 3:36 FEMALE:  And [unintelligible].

3:28 3:29 MALE:  But it's not too big.

3:37 3:37 FEMALE:  No.

3:30 3:35 MALE:  So, not too much pollution.  It's not like in Paris people are nice, so.

3:43 3:45 FEMALE:  So, you think people in Paris are not nice?

3:38 3:40 MALE:  People are very unfriendly in Paris.

3:48 3:50 FEMALE:  Actually, I was there for a summer--like one summer for a few days.

3:43 3:43 MALE:  Yeah.

3:50 4:01 FEMALE:  And my impression is not that great 'cause I think it was summer.  It was hot and humid.  And then--I was like being just like [unintelligible] I always crazy, homeless people.  Is that true?  There are a lot of homeless crazy people.

3:53 3:54 MALE:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4:03 4:15 FEMALE:  'Cause I was walking with my friend we--we traveled together and I was walking and some crazy guy just walked up to me and she's like [unintelligible] wake up.  I was half asleep 'cause I was so tired traveling and I just walked off the subway and they walk up to you.

4:06 4:19 MALE:  That was during the summer?  Yeah, there are more tourists during the summer than [unintelligible] some the--two Paris [unintelligible] they feel like they are--yeah, they are [unintelligible] so.  Okay.

4:26 4:28 FEMALE:  I see.  Well, it was nice meeting you male302.
