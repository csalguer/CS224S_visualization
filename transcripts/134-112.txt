0:42 0:44 MALE:  Well, you can guess.  
0:41 0:42 FEMALE:  I can guess.  
0:45 0:45 MALE:  Yeah.  
0:43 0:50 FEMALE:  Really?  Yeah, um, China, Korea?  
0:53 0:54 MALE:  Oh, yeah.  
0:51 0:52 FEMALE:  Korea, South Korea.  
0:55 0:56 MALE:  Your second choice.  
0:53 0:54 FEMALE:  That was actually my first choice.  
0:58 1:00 MALE:  But then you went by the probability.  
0:57 1:01 FEMALE:  I know.  I know.  [unintelligible] is from South Korea.  
1:05 1:05 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:03 1:04 FEMALE:  The girl in the green jacket.  
1:07 1:08 MALE:  I see.  
1:05 1:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  So, what program are you in?  
1:11 1:12 MALE:  I'm in the business school.  
1:10 1:12 FEMALE:  Oh, you're in the business school.   Are you first year or second year? 
1:16 1:17 MALE:  Third year, huh.  
1:14 1:17 FEMALE:  Third?  Do they have three?  I thought they only had two.  
1:20 1:23 MALE:  I am in the PhD program.  They have PhD program.  
1:20 1:23 FEMALE:  Oh, they have a PhD program.  Oh, okay. Cool.  
1:27 1:28 MALE:  Not many people know about that.  
1:25 1:29 FEMALE:  Okay, no I didn't know about that at all.  So, how many years is it?  
1:32 1:33 MALE:  It's five years.  
1:30 1:34 FEMALE:  Oh, five, okay.  Cool.  So, do you like it?  
1:38 1:43 MALE:  I don't know.  I mean--that's a hard question. 
1:41 1:49 FEMALE:  Yeah.  You don't know, really?  Yeah, so what did you do before you went to business school?  
1:53 1:54 MALE:  I was a math major.  
1:51 1:54 FEMALE:  Oh, you were a math major?  Did you go to Stanford?  
1:58 2:09 MALE:  No, I did my [unintelligible] in Korea and then got my Master's at MIT.  Then I switched my major to finance, which is what I do now.  
2:05 2:09 FEMALE:  Okay, cool.  How do you like California versus the East Coast?  
2:15 2:17 MALE:  Well, I'll say Boston versus Stanford, right?  
2:15 2:17 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  Is Palo Alto kind of boring?  
2:21 2:28 MALE:  Well, I mean--I haven't been other places in the East Coast other than Boston.  Or I will say Boston in their accent.  
2:26 2:29 FEMALE:  Boston, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  
2:32 2:34 MALE:  I think both are very nice places. 
2:32 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:35 2:43 MALE:  Probably those two are one of the best places to live in the U.S. I mean the weather is a little bit colder there still. 
2:40 2:40 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.  
2:44 2:46 MALE:  I love Boston a lot. Have you ever been there?  
2:44 2:50 FEMALE:  Yeah, I like Boston.  It's a good city.  It's a little cold for me in the winter.  Yeah, I'm from the south.  So, I like the sun.  
2:54 2:54 MALE:  I see.  
2:51 2:53 FEMALE:  I like the sunshine out here too.  
2:56 2:57 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Where are you from?  
2:55 2:56 FEMALE:  North Carolina.  
2:59 3:01 MALE: Hum, nice.  
2:58 3:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, and I lived in Washington, DC too.  
3:03 3:04 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
3:01 3:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:05 3:08 MALE:  During the summer when [unintelligible].  
3:06 3:15 FEMALE:  DC I do feel pretty hot, yeah.  So, yeah, but I like it out here definitely. Palo Alto is not very exciting.  
3:19 3:23 MALE:  You mean like it's calm, peaceful, [unintelligible].  
3:21 3:25 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah, but even it's a little suburban.  I like the city better.  I like San Francisco 
3:28 3:32 MALE:  Uh-huh. I see.  So you will go [unintelligible] in the city?  
3:29 3:32 FEMALE:  No, actually I didn't.  Maybe that's why I [crosstalk].  
3:34 3:41 MALE:  That's right.  I see.  I see.  So, your father owns a big ranch with some thousands of horses. 
3:39 3:40 FEMALE:  No, no, not at all.  
3:45 3:47 MALE:  The [unintelligible] are in.  Tomorrow will be another day.  
3:44 3:51 FEMALE:  It's not like Gone with the Wind.  No.  Yeah, that's what a lot of people think about the south, but that's not what it's like.  No.  
3:53 3:54 MALE:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
3:54 3:55 FEMALE:  No.  So, have you ever done this before?  
4:00 4:04 MALE:  Yeah, I did it once in the past like two years ago in [unintelligible].  
4:02 4:04 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Nice meeting you. 
4:07 4:08 MALE:  Nice meeting you. Bye.
4:05 4:06 FEMALE:  Bye.
