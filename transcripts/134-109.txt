0:01 0:02 FEMALE:  They're really like starting to move it along.  
0:05 0:07 MALE:  I feel like my adrenaline has run out.  
0:05 0:06 FEMALE:  Oh, you feel like it has.  
0:09 0:10 MALE:  Just we have to rush.  
0:07 0:09 FEMALE:  Oh, because you have to rush.  Maybe they do that on purpose.  
0:13 0:15 MALE:  Yeah, that's why they [unintelligible].  
0:13 0:27 FEMALE:  Try to keep it ten, you know--yeah, man.  I actually think it's getting better like as it goes.  I think it's nice.  I've never done it before.  So, I thought it was a little--
0:31 0:34 MALE:  [interposing]  Yeah, I've never done it.  I mean I've heard about it.  They have a lot of it in the city.  
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:35 0:36 MALE:  And I've just never gone to one.  
0:33 0:34 FEMALE:  Do you live in the city?  
0:38 0:43 MALE:  No, I live here, but I go to the city once a week.  
0:41 0:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah. So, what program are you in?  
0:47 0:48 MALE:  Electrical engineering.  
0:45 0:47 FEMALE:  Are you?  Did you come with one of your friends? 
0:51 0:51 MALE:  No.  
0:49 0:49 FEMALE:  Oh, no.  
0:52 0:55 MALE:  Actually it's such a big department, that no one really knows each other.  
0:53 0:56 FEMALE:  Oh, really?  Oh, really.  Yeah, I met one guy.  He was a fifth year.  What year are you?  
0:59 0:59 MALE:  Second.  
0:57 0:58 FEMALE:  Second, yeah.  
1:01 1:02 MALE:  How about you?  
0:59 1:00 FEMALE:  I'm in law school.  
1:03 1:03 MALE:  You're in law school?  
1:00 1:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:04 1:05 MALE:  Are you doing the joint one?  
1:03 1:06 FEMALE:  No no, just law, yeah.  And I'm first year.  
1:10 1:13 MALE:  So, did you know you wanted to do law since your undergrad, or?  
1:11 1:15 FEMALE:  That' s a great question.  No, I was a high school teacher before I came to law school.  
1:18 1:18 MALE:  Oh, I see.  
1:16 1:18 FEMALE:  Yeah, so I taught for four years.  
1:21 1:22 MALE: High school teacher?  
1:19 1:20 FEMALE:  Uh-huh. 
1:23 1:28 MALE:  So, teaching high school versus teaching little kids is different.  
1:25 1:25 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  
1:29 1:34 MALE:  Do you find [unintelligible] you are teaching for four years you said, or?  
1:31 1:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, well every year gets a little bit easier.  Uhm--
1:39 1:40 MALE:  Teenagers are just in their prime.  
1:38 1:52 FEMALE:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're definitely rebellious.  They have a lot of energy, and they're very needy.   So, I liked that.  I mean I really liked it.  The hardest--well, there were a lot of hard things, but like the discipline gets easier every year because you know how to deal with it.  
1:56 1:57 MALE:  How do you discipline a student?  
1:58 2:24 FEMALE:  Well, it a lot like honestly the tone that you get because if you're like super nice in the beginning, then they'll totally walk all over you and take advantage. You have to kind of set a strict room, and they're not going to mess with it.  You know, like you'll have [unintelligible], the classroom environment I think.  In the beginning when I first started, I was way too nice, but then, you know, like every year--you can be strict and still nice, you know, because you have to be able to [unintelligible] that.  
2:25 2:26 MALE:  I see.  What subject did you teach?  
2:24 2:26 FEMALE:  I taught English.  Yeah, yeah.  
2:28 2:31 MALE:  Oh, English.  I see.  Did you do English as your undergrad?  
2:29 2:31 FEMALE:  Uh-huh, yeah.  What about you?  Where did you do your undergrad?  
2:33 2:36 MALE:  I did my undergrad in Indiana at Perdue.  
2:32 2:34 FEMALE:  Oh, Indiana, where are you from?  
2:38 2:39 MALE:  Indiana.  
2:37 2:39 FEMALE: Are you?  Wow, did you grow up there your whole life?  
2:43 2:46 MALE:  Uh, I didn't grow up there.  Like I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia.  
2:43 2:47 FEMALE:  Oh, in Indonesia.  Really?  How old were you?  
2:51 2:53 MALE:  I moved to the U.S. when I was 17.  
2:51 2:55 FEMALE:  Seventeen?  Oh, so you just went here for like high school and senior years.  
2:58 2:58 MALE:  Yeah.  
2:56 2:58 FEMALE:  Wow.  Why did you move to Indiana?  
3:03 3:04 MALE:  Because that's where everyone is moving.  
3:02 3:05 FEMALE:  Really?  Indiana, that's so random.  
3:09 3:12 MALE:  Yeah, I'm trying to think why did we decide too?  
3:10 3:13 FEMALE:  Were there like a lot of jobs there, or are there a lot of Indonesian people there? What is it?  
3:17 3:22 MALE:  Not particularly.  There's not many Indonesian people there as well.  So, when I moved here it's very different.  
3:20 3:26 FEMALE:  Oh, I'm sure.  That so [unintelligible].  Wow.  It must have been [unintelligible] especially when you were 17.  
3:30 3:31 MALE:  It was actually quite a shock in the beginning.  
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  I'm sure.  
3:33 3:36 MALE:  You know.  What about you?  Where did you do your undergrad?  
3:33 3:35 FEMALE:  At Wake Forest in North Carolina.  
3:37 3:38 MALE:  Oh, Wake Forest. 
3:35 3:36 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  
3:39 3:41 MALE:  Actually I was told to apply for Wake Forest as well.  
3:38 3:39 FEMALE:  Really?  
3:42 3:43 MALE:  But it's a private school, right?  
3:40 3:42 FEMALE:  Private school, yeah.  Yeah.  
3:46 3:47 MALE:  That's more monthly tuition.  
3:46 3:48 FEMALE:  Exactly. So, have you been back to Indonesia since you moved?  
3:52 3:54 MALE:  I haven't but I'm planning to do it this year.  
3:52 3:57 FEMALE:  Good for you.  It must have been hard to leave all your family, like your family and friends and everything new.  
4:01 4:05 MALE:  Yeah, it was very difficult.  But I still keep in touch.  
4:02 4:05 FEMALE:  That's awesome. Yeah, and your family is still in Indiana?
