2:26 2:27 MALE:  That's [unintelligible] 

2:26 2:44 FEMALE:  And, um, we couldn't actually get in it was so crowded, so we sat in like, you know, they had big screen TVs out in the hallways and stuff like that.  But just the energy and environment was just unbelievable, just you know very positive, very enthusiastic, really believe that change could happen and--it was pretty cool.  [laughter]

2:45 2:49 MALE:  Yeah.  And [unintelligible] 

2:48 2:48 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

2:50 2:51 MALE:  [unintelligible] I didn't feel quite as bad.

2:58 3:00 MALE:  Uh, I was traveling and doing a little bit of research--

3:00 3:00 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

3:01 3:05 MALE:  It's just a great place to just travel.  It's [unintelligible] awesome place.

3:10 3:19 FEMALE:  Well, of course, of course--I, um, had a friend who actually studied abroad there though and she absolutely fell in love with it.  So now I'm very--I'm very intrigued by--

3:20 3:21 MALE:  Do you know where she was?

3:21 3:23 FEMALE:  I don't remember where she was but--

3:25 3:25 MALE:  [unintelligible] 

3:24 3:24 FEMALE:  [unintelligible]

3:33 3:35 MALE:  --and they're just like heartier people than we are--

3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.

3:37 3:38 FEMALE:  [laughter]

3:39 3:43 MALE:  Um, like one of my friends [unintelligible] electric blanket a lot of the day.

3:42 3:43 FEMALE:  [laughter]
