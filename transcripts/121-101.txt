0:05 0:06 MALE: How's it going?

0:06 0:18 FEMALE: I'm so confused. [laughter]  I was looking at the wrong--like the form apparently I'm supposed to be on A.  Put it down Don.  Hi.  [laughter] 

0:19 0:19 MALE: Hi

0:20 0:21 FEMALE: I'm female121.

0:21 0:21 MALE: Nice to meet you.

0:22 0:23 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.

0:23 0:24 MALE: Where uh, where you from?

0:24 0:26 FEMALE: Um, Connecticut.  Where you from?

0:26 0:27 MALE: Uh, California.

0:27 0:29 FEMALE: Really?  What school are you in?

0:29 0:29 MALE: Engineering.

0:30 0:30 FEMALE: Engineering.

0:31 0:32 MALE: I guess everybody in engineering, materials.

0:32 0:35 FEMALE: Oh really?  I'm in the ed school.  It's all mixed up.  Yeah.

0:35 0:35 MALE: Oh okay.

0:36 0:43 FEMALE: Yeah, although a lot of people here that I know are ed school, so--  I think they're a bunch because he's the one running it so I think a number of us showed up tonight.

0:44 0:44 MALE: Okay.

0:44 0:45 FEMALE: So where in California are you from?

0:46 0:47 MALE: Um, I grew up in the East Bay.

0:49 0:53 FEMALE: Mm hmm.  Have you been to the East Coast?  Do you know Connecticut at all?

0:53 0:57 MALE: I've been to the East Coast, um, I've never been to Connecticut.  I have some good friends in Connecticut.

0:57 0:57 FEMALE: Oh really?

0:57 0:57 MALE: Mm hmm.

0:58 1:00 FEMALE: Yeah, I live right outside New York City.

1:00 1:00 MALE: Okay.

1:01 1:02 FEMALE: So Southern Connecticut.

1:03 1:05 MALE: You like the West Coast or--?

1:05 1:14 FEMALE: Um, I've only been here for this year and I don't really-I haven't really had a chance to check too much out so I'm not sure.  But I'm graduating in June and I'm going to end up trying to stay, so--

1:14 1:14 MALE: Okay.

1:14 1:17 FEMALE: If I can get a job out here then I will.  But how about you?

1:18 1:18 MALE: Um.

1:18 1:19 FEMALE: You looking to stay?

1:19 1:21 MALE: Definitely.  I've been in California my entire life.

1:21 1:21 FEMALE: Really.

1:22 1:27 MALE: If you know what I mean, people are kind of really--people on the East Coast are really different in general, you know, than West Coast.

1:27 1:27 FEMALE: Sure.

1:28 1:28 MALE: Different culture.

1:31 1:36 FEMALE: Sure.  It's a little faster.  Well, I lived in New York City for a long time so that's it's own culture unto itself, for sure.

1:36 1:36 MALE: Yeah.

1:37 1:39 FEMALE: For sure.  And are you a doctoral student?

1:40 1:40 MALE: Yeah.

1:40 1:42 FEMALE: Yeah?  How much longer do you have?

1:42 1:44 MALE: Well I'm going to be graduating in uh, September-ish.

1:45 1:47 FEMALE: Good for you.  Wow and then to do what?

1:48 1:55 MALE: Um, well I'm sort of just finishing up some work right now, to write some papers.  Once I finish I'll figure that out.

1:55 1:57 FEMALE: But not to teach or--?

1:58 2:02 MALE: No, either I'll try to get a post-doc somewhere or get a job, so--

2:02 2:06 FEMALE: Mm hmm.  What kind of job can you get with an engineering degree?  If you don't mind me asking.  [laughter] 

2:06 2:07 MALE: What type of job?

2:07 2:07 FEMALE: Yeah.

2:08 2:08 MALE: Well--

2:09 2:10 FEMALE: With what you're focusing on.

2:10 2:14 MALE: Well I guess if I were to get a job it would be a company that's similar to Intel.

2:16 2:24 FEMALE: Cool.  Interesting.  It's a whole world.  I just met some mechanical engineers and it's a whole world that I'm unfamiliar with so--

2:25 2:25 MALE: Engineering?

2:25 2:43 FEMALE: Yeah.  There are so many different facets of it and all the different components.  I don't know where you guys end up in terms of different jobs.  Well I guess you're in mechanical engineering.  I don't necessarily know what that means when you leave in terms of the types of jobs you could look for versus electrical engineering.

2:44 2:53 MALE: Well, you know, electrical engineering would be more like Intel or more Silicon Valley.  In mechanical engineering you'd be more um, you wouldn't necessarily have to be in Silicon Valley.

2:54 2:54 FEMALE: Uh huh.

2:54 2:55 MALE: Most likely it would--

2:56 3:01 FEMALE: Uh huh.  [laughter]  So strange.

3:02 3:02 MALE: Where did you go to college?

3:03 3:06 FEMALE: I went to Dartmouth in New Hampshire, yeah, how about you?

3:06 3:07 MALE: I went here.

3:07 3:12 FEMALE: Oh you did?  Oh, did you leave between finishing undergrad and--  Or you stayed right through?

3:12 3:13 MALE: I stayed straight through.  I've been here--

3:13 3:14 FEMALE: How is that?

3:14 3:15 MALE: I've been here for nine years.

3:15 3:19 FEMALE: Oh my God.  [laughter]  So you really can't leave when you're finished.

3:19 3:19 MALE: No.

3:20 3:22 FEMALE: Oh my goodness.  Are you glad you stayed right through?

3:23 3:23 MALE: Yeah.

3:23 3:24 FEMALE: In retrospect?

3:24 3:24 MALE: Yeah.

3:24 3:25 FEMALE: Yeah?  Yeah?

3:25 3:26 MALE: Stanford's a nice place though.

3:26 3:30 FEMALE: It's a great place.  I know, it's only a one year program kind of--

3:30 3:31 MALE: Oh, you're getting a masters.

3:31 3:31 FEMALE: Yeah.

3:32 3:33 MALE: So you want to teach?

3:33 4:08 FEMALE: Um, it's actually a policy and leadership program so I'll be going into like a lot of non-profits that support schools.  So I won't be in a classroom but will be supporting the teachers and principals.  So I have to figure out what it's going to be because June's really soon.  [laughter]  Interesting.  We don't have much time here to look for work because we're so focused on--since it's only a nine-month masters it's really intensive so we end up spending a lot of our time just doing coursework and we don't have a lot of time to think about jobs.  But I have to buckle down in the next couple weeks because it's getting close, so--

4:09 4:09 MALE: Something will turn up.

4:10 4:17 FEMALE: I hope so, yeah.  I'm sort of doing the networking thing where I'm talking to--  [horn]  Men move.  .

4:18 4:18 MALE: All right.

4:19 4:20 FEMALE: Nice meeting you, have fun tonight.
