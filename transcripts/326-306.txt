2:22 2:24 FEMALE: --but they're re-doing the barn.  So.
2:14 2:14 MALE: Okay.
2:25 2:26 FEMALE: I'm kind of up in other stables.
2:17 2:17 MALE: Okay.  That's good.
2:27 2:28 FEMALE: Yeah.  It's pretty cool.
2:21 2:23 MALE: You are like very much into the dating scene-- 
2:35 2:35 FEMALE: Um--
2:25 2:25 MALE: --here on campus?
2:37 2:44 FEMALE: It depends.  It's kind of like I wouldn't date just to date.  It's kind of more like if there's a person that I like to spend time with, I would do that.
2:35 2:37 MALE: I just don't find time for my friends.
2:48 2:48 FEMALE: Oh no [laughter].
2:40 2:40 MALE: No, from my friends.  They're like--
2:51 2:52 FEMALE: Oh from your friends.

2:57 2:57 FEMALE: Oh happily--
2:48 2:48 MALE: Happily hooked up.
2:58 3:00 FEMALE: Yeah [laughter].  That's too bad.
2:50 2:55 MALE: And guys [laughter] we have to find some single women.  There's no point going out with them.
3:05 3:09 FEMALE: [laughter] Yeah.  Are they from, uh, your department too?  Is that how you know them, from classes or?
2:59 3:00 MALE: No.  From classes and--
3:11 3:11 FEMALE: Yeah.
3:02 3:03 MALE: --generally just hanging around campus.  Mostly from classes.
3:14 3:16 FEMALE: Oh yeah.  Okay.  That's pretty cool [laughter].
3:11 3:12 MALE: I have no idea what to say.
3:22 3:24 FEMALE: I know.  It's kind of difficult.
3:15 3:16 MALE: It's difficult for [unintelligible].
3:26 3:28 FEMALE: Yeah?  Although, what's the best thing you did this week?
3:19 3:23 MALE: The best thing I did this week?  I caught back on some sleep.  Last week--
3:33 3:34 FEMALE: You [unintelligible] sleep [laughter]?
3:24 3:27 MALE: Yeah.  Last week, I was like working so I could have the weekend free.
3:37 3:37 FEMALE: Oh yeah.

3:30 3:30 MALE: I had some projects which-- 
3:40 3:42 FEMALE: No, the weekend--oh what'd you do over the weekend?
3:33 3:40 MALE: Over the weekend?  Well beaches and learned American football.  Probably not my game.
3:50 3:50 FEMALE: That's not easy [laughter].
3:41 3:42 MALE: No, that's not my game.
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: Tackle?
3:43 3:47 MALE: Yeah [laughter].  No way.  I'm more into the cricket, you know. 
3:58 3:58 FEMALE: Sorry?
3:49 3:49 MALE: You know, the game of cricket?
3:59 4:00 FEMALE: Oh yeah.
3:50 3:50 MALE: Yeah.
4:01 4:02 FEMALE: Vaguely.  Like I know of it.
3:52 3:55 MALE: Yeah.  But a more gentlemanly way to do.
4:05 4:06 FEMALE: Did you ever try baseball [laughter]?
3:57 3:57 MALE: I have.
4:08 4:09 FEMALE: That's not the same thing, but.
3:59 4:07 MALE: Yeah.  It's not as much fun.  Baseball is a lot simpler than cricket. Okay.  It's good to meet you.
4:17 4:18 FEMALE: It was good to meet you [laughter].
