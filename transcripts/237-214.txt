00:02  00:02	FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.
00:03  00:04	MALE:  So, I bet people confuse your name as female237.
00:05  00:08	FEMALE:  Indeed.  I'm really impressed that you got it, the first time.
00:09  00:09	MALE:  So what kind of name is that?
00:10  00:11	FEMALE:  It's a Hebrew name.  Hebrew yeah.
00:12  00:13	MALE:  Hebrew.  Oh, are you Jewish?
00:13  00:14	FEMALE:  I am Jewish.
00:14  00:15	MALE:  Awesome, me too.  I'm not, I'm not Jewish. 
00:16  00:16	FEMALE:  Whatever [laughter].
00:20  00:22	MALE:  I wish.  We all wish.  Just kidding.  So where are you from female237?
00:23  00:24	FEMALE:  I'm originally from the D.C area.  
00:25  00:25	MALE:  Okay.
00:26  00:27	FEMALE:  And then I've been in Massachusetts, Oregon, here.
00:27  00:28	MALE:  Oh, what did you do it Massachusetts?
00:28  00:28	FEMALE:  College.
00:29  00:29	MALE:  Where did you go?
00:29  00:30	FEMALE:  William's College.
00:30  00:31	MALE:  Oh, okay, cool.  Is that one of the seven sisters?
00:32  00:39	FEMALE:  It's not [laughter].  It's um, yeah, its coed.  It's like Amherst is a big rival.
00:40  00:50	MALE:  Right.  Okay.  I was watching the Simpson's and Lisa Simpson was offered an admission as one of the seven sister's college if she lost purposely at a spelling bee.  Ever see the Simpson's?
00:51  00:54	FEMALE:  I do Simpson's I can't imagine I missed that episode.
00:55  00:57	MALE:  I haven't seen that episode.  So I looked at all the colleges and I --
00:58  01:02	FEMALE:  Yeah, Wellesley is probably is seven [unintelligible] at times.
01:03  01:11	MALE:  I stayed in Boston for a short period of time when I was in high school.  I was at a summer program.  And so it was a lot of fun there was so much action in the area, it was really exciting.
01:12  01:13	FEMALE:  Yeah, Boston is great.
01:14  01:15	MALE:  So what do you do here at Stanford?
01:16  01:18	FEMALE:  I'm in the School of Education, so Master --
01:19  01:20	MALE:  Okay.  So you're familiar with this building.
01:20  01:31	FEMALE:  I am.  Although to be honest this isn't -- I've never had a class here or anything.  This is sort of more of teacher education and curriculum teacher research building.  So, I still --
01:32  01:32	MALE:  Okay.
01:33  01:33	FEMALE:  But yeah [laughter].
01:34  01:35	MALE:   What are you going to do after the school of education?
01:38  01:57	FEMALE:  Um, that's sort of the question of the month.  But, ah, the leading contenders are education reporter, some newspaper or magazine what have you.  Um, I actually, like this is totally not really work I've done here, but oral history.  Like an oral historian and then kind of contemplating like PhD in History or in like -- or maybe just [unintelligible].
02:03  02:04	MALE:  So this is your first year then, right?
02:04  02:05	FEMALE:  Yeah.  
02:06  02:07	MALE:  This is my second year in the mechanical engineering.  
02:07  02:08	FEMALE:  Okay
02:08  02:13	MALE:  And next year will be my first year at aerospace.  So I'm going for two Masters.
02:14  02:15	FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  How does that work [laughter]?  How do you do that?
02:15  02:25	MALE:  So, I -- I wanted to do aerospace and I got some job offers.  But, they were on satellites and I didn't want to work on satellites so I'm staying in to see if I can work on rockets.
02:26  02:26	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
02:27  02:28	MALE:  Or space vehicles.
02:28  02:31	FEMALE:  Yeah, my roommate -- one of my roommates is in aerospace to do like rocket things.
02:32  02:32	MALE:  Oh really, what's their name?
02:33  02:33	FEMALE:  Sarah Snoot [phonetic].
02:34  02:34	MALE:  Sarah?
02:35  02:35	FEMALE:  Sarah Snoot.
02:36  02:37	MALE:  Snoot, yeah I know her.
02:37  02:38	FEMALE:  Yeah.  She does rockets.  I mean I --
02:39  02:40	MALE:  She has, um, long hair right.
02:41  02:42	FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
02:43  02:44	MALE:  Okay, she's in one of my classes actually.
02:45  02:53	FEMALE:  Yeah, so I don't like -- her books -- like, my other roommate is also an Ed School person so, we look at her textbooks are like [laughter].
02:54  03:11	MALE:  Well, honestly when I first looked at it, it's mind-boggling and then when I try to do some derivations it makes sense.  But then after I come back after a break I look at it again and I'm like I have no idea what this is, because I just forget.  There are some students that are really good with theory and they understand it before they read it.  I'm one of those guys that's good at a little bit of everything.
03:12  03:13	FEMALE:  Oh, okay.
03:14  03:15	MALE:  That's my goal that's why I'm taking a lot of classes.
03:16  03:24	FEMALE:  So, you start -- do you start mechanical engineering thinking that's what you wanted -- that was sort of what you wanted to do, how did you do it?
03:25  03:49	MALE:  Well, I -- I've been kind of stupid.  I was in -- I worked for Crest Toothpaste and I made toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes and I worked on Crest White Strips.  A then I worked for Always on the machinery not designer products, obvious reasons, I'm not that skilled.  So then I just kind of got bored so I came to school to look at new options and then I decided to do aerospace because that what I've always wanted to do.  But I decided not to do it because the job market was never good until now.
03:50  03:54	FEMALE:  So what accounts for the new job market upswing?
03:55  04:04	MALE:  It's -- there's a push to go to Mars [horn].  Like the biggest thing is the [unintelligible] -- you've heard of that.
04:05  04:05	FEMALE:  Yeah.
04:06  04:06	MALE:  So, very nice meeting you female237.
04:07  04:07	FEMALE:  Nice meeting you.
