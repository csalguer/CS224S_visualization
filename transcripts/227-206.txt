1:30 1:30 MALE:  Good evening, how are you?
1:30 1:44 FEMALE:  [laughter] I'm female227 again.  Um, I am from about five different places.  I grew up in Minnesota, went to school in Massachusetts, I worked in D.C., and then I came here.  So I've lived pretty much everywhere.  
1:44 1:47 MALE:  So where do you like?
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  I liked -
1:48 1:50 MALE:  [unintelligible].
1:50 2:09 FEMALE:  That's a good question.  I like here, but I'm having job like, trouble finding exactly what I want here, so I'm making that -- I'm interviewing next week in New York.  So I'm making that decision to actually try moving somewhere else.  But I have a feeling once I get to New York I'm gonna be like I can't here.
2:09 2:10 MALE:  Have you lived in New York before?
2:10 2:13 FEMALE:  No, that's one of the only places I haven't lived, so.
2:13 2:17 MALE:  [unintelligible] consider [unintelligible].
2:17 2:21 FEMALE:  Yeah, I haven't -- I would always consider that I would never live there, you know. 
2:21 2:22 MALE:  Yeah, I never think that I would [unintelligible] live there.
2:22 2:22 FEMALE:  No?
2:22 2:26 MALE:  I've been there a couple times, you know, and every time I'm there I just feel like -
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  Too much going on or?
2:27 2:30 MALE:  It's like this pace, but like -
2:30 2:33 FEMALE:  All the time.  So you never get to rest.
2:33 2:33 MALE:  Yeah.
2:33 2:35 FEMALE:  Yeah, it definitely -
2:35 2:39 MALE:  So like, you must be pretty friendly.  Must be -- like all my friends from there and lived there -
