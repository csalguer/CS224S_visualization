0:03 0:04 FEMALE:  No, that's fine.  Don't worry about it.
0:09 0:13 MALE:  I had like every one of these wrong.  So I thought I better just fix it.
0:09 0:12 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.  female123.  
0:15 0:15 MALE: male116.
0:14 0:14 FEMALE: Nice to meet you.
0:17 0:20 MALE:  So the obligatory question, what program are you in or?
0:16 0:17 FEMALE:  Um, I'm in law school.
0:22 0:22 MALE:  Oh you're at--what year?
0:18 0:18 FEMALE:  First year.
0:23 0:27 MALE:  Oh cool.  I'm doing a--I'm in poly/sci.  I'm doing a joint law [unintelligible].
0:23 0:24 FEMALE:  Oh, you are?
0:28 0:31 MALE:  So I'll be doing law school starting fall of '06.
0:27 0:30 FEMALE:  Fall of '06.  So how much have you done of political science so far?
0:34 0:35 MALE:  I'm in year one.
0:31 0:32 FEMALE:  Okay.  So you just started.
0:36 0:40 MALE:  Yeah, which I don't like to think about how long this will all take.
0:36 0:38 FEMALE:  How long is the entire program supposed to be?
0:43 0:47 MALE:  Uh, if you are done with everything in six years.  That's like really fast.
0:43 0:46 FEMALE:  No, that's amazing.  Just 'cause [unintelligible] especially getting your PHD done in three years.
0:51 1:01 MALE:  Yeah.  Um, a lot, yeah, you can kind of cut some corners a little bit.  But yeah, most people, I think, are seven years.  It's like
0:57 0:59 FEMALE:  Oh wow.  So are there a lot of people who do that joint program?
1:05 1:11 MALE:  It's becoming increasingly common, yeah.  Like, I think ten years ago it was pretty rare.  But I think it's kind of common now.
1:07 1:13 FEMALE:  So is it policy work that you want to do?  Or [laughter] I'm just sort of curious what one does with that.  I know--
1:17 1:28 MALE:  You sound my mom [laughter].  No, it's good.  She almost said the exact same thing.  I mean, I think the most common thing is just, like, try and become a legal academic.
1:29 1:29 FEMALE:  Oh right.  Okay.
1:29 1:33 MALE:  But policy work is like, also common.  So those are both things that interest me.  But I'm not sure.  I don't think I want to be a political scientist.
1:34 1:34 FEMALE:  Why not?
1:40 1:55 MALE:  I don't think political science, like, answers what it's supposed to answer.  I think [unintelligible] is too complicated, and I think it--I don't know.  I just don't think you get anywhere.  We're still like answering the same old questions.  What do you want to do?  What are you doing in the summer?
1:51 1:52 FEMALE:  I'm working at a law firm.
1:56 1:57 MALE:  Really?  Which one?
1:53 1:55 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] Cleveland.
1:59 2:03 MALE:  Oh cool.  Is that where you're from originally or you want to be out in that area now?
1:59 2:03 FEMALE:  No.  I mean, it's [unintelligible] summer, so I thought, you know when else do I just get to go home for a summer.
2:07 2:07 MALE:  Sure.
2:04 2:20 FEMALE:  'Cause after the, you know, year [unintelligible] summer, [unintelligible] actually work at a law firm that you might want to work at when you graduate.  And then afterwards, you get a real job.  So I thought, you know, I'm never going to get a chance again to go home and, you know, I have a niece who's--she's the most adorable thing in the world.  She's actually a Pampers model.  She did a photo shoot for Pampers.
2:25 2:26 MALE:  Really?  That's awesome.
2:22 2:27 FEMALE:  She is so cute.  So I'm just going to go home and play for the summer and stuff.  And you know, I mean--
2:31 2:32 MALE:  Make a lot of money.
2:29 2:35 FEMALE:  Make a lot of money, and they take you out and like, they take you to Indian's games, which like, Indian's games, they have the most amazing baseball field in Cleveland [unintelligible].
2:39 2:39 MALE:  The [unintelligible], yeah.
2:35 2:36 FEMALE:  It's amazing.  
2:41 2:41 MALE:  I've been there.
2:37 2:38 FEMALE:  Oh you've been?
2:42 2:42 MALE:  Yeah.
2:39 2:41 FEMALE:  How is--why have you been there?  Are you from the Midwest?
2:45 2:46 MALE:  I'm from Illinois.
2:42 2:42 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:47 2:56 MALE: I forget what the year was.  It might have been '02 or something.  I was taking like a trip out to New York.  Like, so I like to stop and see baseball stadiums, if it's on the way.
2:53 2:53 FEMALE:  Right.
3:00 3:03 MALE:  And so, I think I've been to like 12 parks, which like, compared to my friends is nothing.  But like, I'm building slowly, you know [laughter].
3:00 3:12 FEMALE:  [unintelligible] field I think is--I mean, I don't even like baseball.  But I think it's just so fun to go there and like walk around.  And like, god, every time I go there, I pay like $20 for a hotdog, and like everything else.  It's just a fun time to go, so.
3:16 3:16 MALE:  Yeah.
3:13 3:16 FEMALE:  And then they promised to take me to a baseball game, so it's like, okay.  I can do that.  I can work with it.
3:21 3:24 MALE:  Yeah.  No.  And like,  you'll--I think you'll learn a lot.
3:20 3:24 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I'm sorry, well.  It was nice to meet you.
3:28 3:29 MALE:  Likewise.  Enjoy the night.  
3:25 3:27 FEMALE:  I will see you in two years, anyway.
3:32 3:32 MALE:  Yeah.  Right.
