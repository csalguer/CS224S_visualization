0:29 0:30 MALE:  Yeah.
0:30 0:58 FEMALE:  But anyway.  Um, masters student, product design, it's a small division in mechanical engineering.  Uh, first year, it's a two year program.  Uh, it's a fun, it's very fitting to me because I'm very like, mechanical engineering, but then like artistic.  I like prosthetic, utilitarian pleasing things.  This is true, I should probably.

1:16 1:17 FEMALE:  Cool.
1:16 1:35 MALE:  And so I'm over in management science and engineering now, sort of doing more business and like psychology stuff than actual like engineering, but.  Let's see what else do, do, do.  Um, I've read the "Art of Innovation", you know Tom Kelley came to speak to our class.  It like, I mean he really bows down to ideals and...
1:29 1:39 FEMALE:  Oh, yes.  I know isn't everybody, its a little clich'e and I'm almost like annoyed with it, that, anyway, sorry, go...
1:40 1:42 MALE:  No, they do nice things but you know it got--
1:41 1:43 FEMALE:  Yeah, it's just, it's so overwhelming here, you know.
1:43 1:47 MALE:  I know, it's like, I've seen the shopping cart  video, you know, it's like, one too many times.
1:47 1:48 FEMALE:  Yes, oh, okay.
1:49 1:56 MALE:  But yeah, and actually we're study like lunar technologies this quarter.  And I don't know what they do, but it's sort of like a Ideo's  [phonetic] little brother.
1:56 1:58 FEMALE:  Oh, are you in that creative innovation class?
1:58 2:00 MALE:  Yeah.  Have you heard about it?
2:00 2:06 FEMALE:  I have, I have, and it sounded interesting.  Um, yeah, I didn't realize it, what it was about.
2:07 2:09 MALE:  Well, you should try it next year as part of your two year program.
2:09 2:11 FEMALE:  Hum, that's true.
2:11 2:30 MALE:  It's pretty cool.  I mean everyday you do something like different.  Like, yesterday we designed like Mother's Day cards.  And in previous days we go like, Stanford shopping center and like, you know, see how like the shoppers react.  And we had to like go to Tiffany's and sort of like try to pose as like a, you know a serious customer or something.
2:30 2:36 FEMALE:  That's cool, that's cool.  I think I do that stuff all the time by myself so, we'll see.  I like to play little games with people all the time.
2:36 2:44 MALE:  It was fun I, I, like our group went into Tiffany's and I was actually the only one that got like a brochure, like attention from sales people, so.
2:43 2:45 FEMALE:  Oh, interesting.
2:46 2:52 MALE:  I, not, not that I have, you know, the financial means to buy an expensive ring or something but, so it's.
2:52 2:53 FEMALE:  Did you do undergrad in engineering?
2:53 2:55 MALE:  No, no, psychology and French.
2:54 2:55 FEMALE:  Oh, psychology, okay.
2:56 2:58 MALE:  Yeah, so, I, I sort of stay more on the artsy side as well.
2:58 3:01 FEMALE:  Great, so did you, uh, take some time off before starting?
3:01 3:09 MALE:  No, not really, I mean, I went to Japan for um, a month in between grad and undergrad.  And I, you know, taught some English there and toured around and saw different things, so.
3:08 3:11 FEMALE:  I see, so you're kind of, your graduating now aren't you?
3:11 3:12 MALE:  Yeah.
3:12 3:14 FEMALE:  Oh, okay, so what are you doing afterwards?
3:14 3:24 MALE:  I'm not sure.  I actually only found out today that my request for graduation had been approved.  So I would have say like an extra fall.  So I have this whole semester that I don't know what I'm going to do with, but. 
3:24 3:26 FEMALE:  Oh, hum, well, that's great.
3:26 3:43 MALE:  So, well we'll see, I'm like doing some applications.  I mean I was just at a thing with Edward Jones today which, was an interesting presentation.  But then I realized that, you know like all you do is knock on people's doors and ask if they'd like to buy some, you know investment advice or something.  And I don't think I'm that kind of man, but.
3:43 3:45 FEMALE:  Right, right, right.  Well, what would you like to do?
3:45 3:56 MALE:  Well, I'd really like to work for Disney, actually, in like the Imagineering department.  I think that'd be like the coolest thing ever, at least for a little while and then, if not, then something where I can travel and sort of work with the communications and people and things, so.
3:57 3:59 FEMALE:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh that sounds cool.
3:59 4:01 MALE:  So what's the coolest thing you've designed?
4:03 4:08 FEMALE:  I made a, a stool out of bike parts.  It was really, I really love it.  It's like this--
4:08 4:09 MALE:  Cool.
4:09 4:13 FEMALE:  Yeah, you'll have to see it.  But, anyway.  Hey, what was your name again?
4:13 4:14 MALE:  male212.
4:14 4:15 FEMALE:  male212, okay, nice to meet you.
