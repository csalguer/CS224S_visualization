0:54 0:54 FEMALE: I know.
0:54 0:56 MALE: Yeah.  You can save a lot of rent on the side.
0:55 0:56 FEMALE: Till I can find a job [laughter].
0:56 0:58 MALE: Exactly.  When do you have to start looking for jobs?
0:59 1:02 FEMALE: Um, actually I had an interview this morning at Google.  Um, so. 
1:03 1:03 MALE: How'd it go?
1:04 1:11 FEMALE: I think it went pretty well.  It's actually for marketing, which is at all nothing what I am getting the degree in.  But that's okay [laughter].  They're fun.
1:12 1:14 MALE: Would that be something that you were interested in if you got the job?
1:13 1:22 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  But I mean, engineering's cool, but it's kind of not very people oriented, so.  How about you?
1:22 1:26 MALE: I'm in the teacher education program.  And uh, it's just off the one year master program.
1:27 1:27 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
1:28 1:32 MALE: And then, yeah, so.  I teach--I--till I get my license--student teach up in the San Francisco, and then come back down here take classes.
1:33 1:34 FEMALE: Oh that's kind of cool.  
1:34 1:34 MALE: Yeah.  It's great.
1:34 1:35 FEMALE: Which, um, school, in San Francisco?
1:36 1:42 MALE: I teach at Mission.  And--but next year I'm going to be teaching Excel Academy, which is a small--it's a small charter school.
1:43 1:43 FEMALE: Oh.
1:43 1:53 MALE: It just--it's uh, they're in--they'll be in their third year next year.  This--I really like it.  They're mission, like--their math department--I'm a math teacher.  And their math department isn't like fantastic.  Like I've worked with a really fantastic math department this year.
1:53 1:53 FEMALE:  Right, right.
1:54 2:02 MALE: But, um, the whole mission of the school is awesome.  It's based around like, environmental leadership and bringing like, environmental education to urban kids, which is pretty awesome, so.
2:03 2:04 FEMALE: Yeah.  That sounds very cool.
2:04 2:06 MALE: I really like what they're doing.  And everyone I met there is really neat, so.
2:06 2:07 FEMALE: Yeah.  Do you like this school?
2:08 2:08 MALE: Uh, yeah.  I really like it.  Um--
2:08 2:11 FEMALE: I was thinking about doing that too, after my master's.  So--
2:11 2:11 MALE: Oh really?
2:11 2:12 FEMALE: The education, yeah.
2:12 2:18 MALE: Yeah.  You should definitely come back and do that [laughter].  Yeah, it worked for a few--we had a couple people who--we had one guy who was an engineer for a few years--
2:19 2:19 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:19 2:20 MALE: --and, uh, now he's switching careers [unintelligible] to be the teacher.
2:20 2:24 FEMALE: Yeah.  That's very cool.  'Cause I think the best memories I've had were, you know, TA'ing or something.
2:24 2:25 MALE: Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Exactly.
2:25 2:26 FEMALE: All the classes I've done, so.
2:26 2:31 MALE: You should definitely do it.  It's a great--I really like the program here.  I was, you know, I didn't know what to expect coming in--
2:32 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:32 2:33 MALE: And I really debated between a lot of programs.
2:34 2:34 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:34 2:40 MALE: But this is great.  Like the people were great, and, um, just kind of [unintelligible] philosophies were great.  I really, I really enjoyed it.  I feel like I've learned a lot.

2:49 2:49 FEMALE: Quickly [laughter].
2:50 2:55 MALE: Yeah, quickly.  A lot of quickly, a lot of classes--'cause the days are just really long, too.  You know, like you teach in the morning, then you have class till six, and so--
2:56 2:57 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
2:57 3:00 MALE: It's really busy.  By this time, we're all fried in this strain.  You know, it's like it's--
3:00 3:00 FEMALE: You're like uh [laughter].

3:52 3:58 MALE: I really liked Providence, though.  It's a neat--it's a neat city.  It's like it's not too big.  It's like in between Boston and New York.  If you want to go to the big city--
3:58 3:58 FEMALE:  Yeah, yeah.
3:59 4:02 MALE: Providence is kind of small.  And there's lots to do in New England and stuff.  It's fun.
4:02 4:04 FEMALE: Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  Well it's nice to meet you [laughter].
