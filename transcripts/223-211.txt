0:01 0:01 MALE:  [laughter] So what department are you? 
0:02 0:02 FEMALE:  Linguistics
0:03 0:03 MALE:  Linguistics? 
0:04 0:04 FEMALE:  Yeah, what about you? 
0:05 0:07 MALE:  I'm in the business school PhD program. 
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  Okay. 
0:08 0:09 MALE:  Which as nothing to do with the MBA.  
0:10 0:13 FEMALE:  Okay.  And how long have you been here? 
0:14 0:16 MALE:  This is my fourth year.  
0:17 0:17 FEMALE:  Okay, I'm second.  
0:18 0:18 MALE:  Second. PhD?  
0:19 0:19 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:20 0:20 MALE:  So linguistics is like, which---is there a specific language which is the prime language? 
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  No. 
0:25 0:26 MALE:  It's just you're studying-- 
0:27 0:47 FEMALE:  Yeah, just language in general, yeah.  Um, so I'm mainly interested in socio-linguistics.  Like um, like just the interaction with society and language, um, and I particularly am interested in Japanese.  So that's kind of what I focus in, but we don't necessarily have to focus on like any particular thing.  
0:48 0:57 MALE:  It's really interesting, like with my friends many times we have these discussions about languages.  Like, I mean, in the business, could be interesting, there are people from all--like I'm from India, my roommate's from Israel.
0:58 0:58 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:58 1:00 MALE:  And we talk about like differences in language.  
1:01 1:01 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:01 1:04 MALE:  Like the fact that English is a language of which has no genders. 
1:05 1:05 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:05 1:08 MALE:  And, like Hindu has genders, Hebrew has, but the gender is different for different languages.  
1:09 1:10 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:10 1:12 MALE:  How that came into being, and you know. 
1:13 1:13 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
1:13 1:21 MALE:  There some similarities like uh, I mean you have these words for uh, half, a half, a quarter, but like a third is a third. 
1:22 1:22 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:23 1:28 MALE:  It's the same, like in India, you have a half, you have a quarter, but a third is, you know, a third.  Exactly the way in English, which is weird, right? 
1:29 1:29 FEMALE: Mm.  
1:30 1:34 MALE:  Because why would you have a different word for half and a quarter, not one like, one quarter. 
1:35 1:43 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Language is so interesting, isn't it?  Everybody, I think, thinks it's interesting on some level.  Everybody like to talk about language, because everybody deals with it so intimately all the time.  
1:44 1:46 MALE:  That's true, especially when you're in a place where people from such different, like--
1:47 1:47 FEMALE: Mm-hmm. 
1:47 1:48 MALE:  --like linguistics backgrounds get to that. 
1:49 1:49 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Yeah.  
1:51 1:51 FEMALE:  Yeah. 
1:51 1:52 MALE:  [unintelligible] must be so interesting.  
1:53 2:00 FEMALE:  [laughter] Well when linguists get together, we talk about really dorky linguistics things, like with each other.  [laughter] 
2:01 2:07 MALE:  We do that, like me and--I mean, I, in the business school, my work is mostly applied math, so when we get together we are talking about, you know--
2:08 2:08 FEMALE:  Your research and stuff [laughter].  
2:09 2:12 MALE:  --yeah, I mean we do big jokes like you know, with epsilons and deltas.    
2:13 2:13 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:13 2:14 MALE:  And we think they're funny.  
2:14 2:15 FEMALE:  [laughter] 
2:15 2:16 MALE:  See what a nerd I am here.  [laughter]  
2:16 2:20 FEMALE:  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  So um--
2:21 2:24 MALE:  So are you still uh, are you into your research already or? 
2:25 2:33 FEMALE:  Um, I'm still, I'm still finishing class work and we have two qualifying papers.  I just finished my first one, so then I have to do one more and then I'll start my dissertations. 
2:34 2:35 MALE:  Is that now, right now?   
2:36 2:36 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:37 2:38 MALE:  All the best.  
2:38 2:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, what about you? 
2:40 2:48 MALE:  I mean I'm in my fourth year, I'll be done like in a year and a quarter maybe.  I mean I'm done with all qualifying.  The only qualifying left is to get a job.  
2:49 2:51 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Where do you think you want to go? 
2:52 2:53 MALE:  Uh, I want to get into Academia--
2:54 2:54 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
2:55 2:59 MALE:  --it's in the business school, so it would pretty much be supplying of jobs, maybe the crucial factor. 
3:00 3:01 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:01 3:01 MALE:  So--
3:01 3:03 FEMALE:  So you might end up, you know, no where.  [laughter]
3:04 3:04 MALE:  Hmm? 
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  You might, you don't know where you might end up then, wherever a job opens up and--
3:06 3:06 MALE:  I don't know, yeah, I mean given preference I would love to stay here in California, but--
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  Yeah.  California's great isn't it.  Yeah.  
3:12 3:12 MALE:  Where are you from? 
3:13 3:14 FEMALE:  I'm from Kentucky. 
3:14 3:14 MALE:  Kentucky. 
3:15 3:15 FEMALE:  Yeah.  It's like middle of nowhere.  [laughter] Very small town.  Where in India are you from? 
3:21 3:21 MALE:  I'm from the north--
3:22 3:22 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
3:23 3:23 MALE:  --in New Delhi.  
3:24 3:27 FEMALE:  Yeah.  Well how, like when did you move to America?  
3:28 3:28 MALE:  After my Bachelors--
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Uh huh. 
3:30 3:33 MALE:  --I come here, I applied to grad school, and you know, just came straight and here I am.
3:34 3:37 FEMALE:  So what do you think?  Just being, like, life in America in general? 
3:38 3:43 MALE:  It's, it's really different, but it's fun.  Especially I think the Bay area. This is a place where if I-- 
3:44 3:45 FEMALE:  It's a great place. 
3:45 3:51 MALE:  --yeah, so even if you like being in a completely Indian, I just have my Indian friends, we go to Indian place  which has Indian waiters and you know, it's India.   
3:52 3:52 FEMALE: Mm-hmm.
