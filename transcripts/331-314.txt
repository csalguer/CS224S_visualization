00:01 00:01 FEMALE: Hi.  female331.  
00:02 00:02 MALE: Nice to meet you.  I'm nameX.  
00:03 00:03 FEMALE: nameX.  
00:03 00:05 MALE: Yeah.  Let's have an unusual conversation.  
00:06 00:07 FEMALE: Okay.  So what do you want to do?  
00:07 00:12 MALE: Uh, what's the last thing interesting thing that you read?  
00:13 00:15 FEMALE: Oh, gosh.  That's not school related?  
00:15 00:16 MALE: Okay, uh, watched?  
00:19 00:20 FEMALE: [laughter] Um--
00:21 00:22 MALE: Thought about.  That's broad.  
00:24 00:49 FEMALE: Makes me sound so boring.  I'm, like, I don't read or watch or [unintelligible] in my room.  Um...I don't know.  I guess, I guess, there's this book [unintelligible].  It's about, um, how the animals think.  It was this woman who's, like, autistic, she comes up to the house, she sees guns in the pictures but she doesn't think, like, in terms of language.  At one point she sees things thinking that's how animals see things.  Like animals see things--
00:49 00:51 MALE: Yes, I read about this woman very recently.  
00:51 00:51 FEMALE: You know, yeah.  
00:51 00:53 MALE: And she was at slaughterhouses and stuff?  Yes.  
00:53 00:59 FEMALE: Yes.  And I bought the book.  I have the book.  So, um, it's not written as well as I thought it would be but--  
00:58 00:59 MALE: She's autistic.  [laughter]
01:00 01:00 FEMALE: [laughter]  [unintelligible] 
01:01 01:02 MALE: Oh, okay.  
01:02 01:16 FEMALE: But it's really interesting, like, the way just animals, like, the way--they perceive things by--I was trying to think what it would be like to think in pictures.  It was a weird [unintelligible] right?  What do you think?  [unintelligible] 
01:15 01:22 MALE: Well, I only read the summary article where, for example she was [unintelligible], like the yellow coat from the house because that scared the cows.    
01:22 01:23 FEMALE: Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.  
01:23 01:39 MALE: Uh, so, as I understand it, it would be, like, um--I just wanted to see, like, the psychology of it, like, her brains being rewired and so on.  And one thing that's actually quite interesting is that, uh, actually it was interesting to me, because there's a lot of people in Silicon Valley and Route 128 is the highest instances of autism in the nation.  
01:39 01:39 FEMALE: No.  
01:39 01:39 MALE: Yes.  
01:40 01:40 FEMALE: I didn't know that.  
01:40 01:42 MALE: And I think the reason is--
01:42 01:42 FEMALE: Silicon Valley in particular?  
01:43 01:46 MALE: Yes.  Silicon Valley and Route 128 near MIT and Harvard.  
01:47 01:48 FEMALE: Whoa. 
01:47 01:48 MALE: Yeah.  And so the reason for--
01:48 01:49 FEMALE: Near MIT and Harvard, huh? 
01:50 01:50 MALE: Yes. 
01:50 01:51 FEMALE: Okay.  
01:51 01:59 MALE: So the reason for the concentration, people have speculated, I suppose, you know, guys who might not have reproduced, you know, two or three generations back, now, you know--
01:58 01:58 FEMALE: Right.  
01:59 02:08 MALE: Running $200,000, you know, jobs out of, you know, doing backends, you know, manipulations and so on.  And so the computer nerds are also meeting with other computer nerds and producing lots of sick kids.  
02:08 02:17 FEMALE: Well, the reason for autism in--they're little geniuses and like, some feel [unintelligible] backwards and, like, other things when they just don't have the same skills.
02:17 02:18 MALE: Right.  Are you--what are you, uh?  
02:18 02:18 FEMALE: I'm not autistic.  
02:18 02:19 MALE: I know.  
02:19 02:19 FEMALE: [laughter] .  
02:23 02:24 MALE: What are you studying?  Are you?    
02:24 02:24 FEMALE: English.
02:25 02:27 MALE: Great, I was an English major as an undergrad.  
02:26 02:27 FEMALE: You were?  Where were you?  
02:27 02:28 MALE: Here at Stanford.  
02:28 02:29 FEMALE: At Stanford?  
02:29 02:29 MALE: Yeah.  
02:29 02:33 FEMALE: Really.  I'm TA'ing an English course right now.  You might have had me.  Where did you do your graduate?  
02:33 02:34 MALE: I graduated in 2001.  
02:34 02:34 FEMALE: Oh.  
02:34 02:36 MALE: So it was '97 to 2001.  
02:36 02:42 FEMALE: Okay.  Uh, well, you really couldn't have.  If you had stuck around--you could have been a student in my [unintelligible].  
02:40 02:41 MALE: I would have if I--
02:43 02:44 FEMALE: I'm TA'ing development of the short story now.  
02:45 02:53 MALE: Oh, great.  No wonder.  So I was, like, when I asked you that, you know, no wonder you're trying to filter out the things that you had read for class.  
02:53 02:59 FEMALE: Yeah, that's a--yeah.  And like for me, I read all the time so the productions in the [unintelligible] newspaper--he wants to know what's your favorite author.  Well, I don't really know.  
02:59 03:00 MALE: Exactly.  
03:00 03:03 FEMALE: Because I don't--I read so much that I just can't--I can pick anything.  
03:03 03:05 MALE: You should narrow it down to a genre.  
03:04 03:05 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  
03:04 03:07 MALE: It's, like, you know, action movies, talk to anybody about action movies, etc.  
03:06 03:11 FEMALE: Yeah, that's one thing.  So you did English and why did you decide to do business?  
03:12 03:14 MALE: Ah, well, I'm actually in the [unintelligible] engineering.    
03:14 03:14 FEMALE: Oh, I'm sorry, engineering.  
03:15 03:18 MALE: Yeah.  Well, because, uh, I mean I was a double major as an undergraduate.  
03:18 03:19 FEMALE: EE and English?  
03:19 03:19 MALE: Yes.  
03:20 03:20 FEMALE: That's awesome.  
03:21 03:21 MALE: Yeah, well. 
03:21 03:25 FEMALE: No, no.  I mean, not necessary, like, each one individually, but the combination is--
03:25 03:26 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  
03:26 03:29 FEMALE: Anyone else that had that problem?  That's a weird problem.  
03:29 03:35 MALE: It's because basically, the thing is I came in, declared as English major because I, you know, oh yeah, I'm going to write the great American novel and so on.  And so--
03:36 03:36 FEMALE: But you did creative writing?  
03:37 03:38 MALE: Uh, yeah.  I tried to.  
03:38 03:39 FEMALE: You tried to, like, do some?    
03:39 03:43 MALE: I mean, I mean actually I was decent at it, but the thing is that--
03:42 03:42 FEMALE: What are they doing?    
03:44 03:45 MALE: I don't know.    
03:45 03:46 FEMALE: Daivd, berate her.  [laughter] 
03:49 03:57 MALE: But like, uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, the thing is that, the double EE stuff is kind of like what I do on the side so...
03:57 04:05 FEMALE: But that's, like, the money maker, right?  I think there's very low money here, I'm not going to be professor, hopefully just get my little meager sum and just be happy, you know.  That's my thing.  
04:06 04:08 MALE: Well, if you're a professor that's something.
04:09 04:16 FEMALE: I don't know about, like, you start out, like, 30,000.  Like, they're paying us 20,000, [unintelligible] students.  It's like, come on, we've got plenty [unintelligible]--
04:16 04:18 MALE: Well, you do it for the love and the freedom.  
04:18 04:19 FEMALE: The freedom.  That's what we do it for.    
04:21 04:22 MALE: Nice to meet you.  
04:21 04:22 FEMALE: Nice to meet you too.
