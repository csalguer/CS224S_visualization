1:47 1:50 MALE: And this, this was in Chemistry or chemical engineering as well, or--
1:49 1:51 FEMALE: Uh, it was in chemical engineering, biochemical--
1:52 1:54 MALE: Were you at, like, Queen's College or were you--
1:53 1:55 FEMALE: I was at University College, London. 
1:55 2:01 MALE: Okay.  And, uh, that was with Iowa State, or--
2:01 2:18 FEMALE: Yeah, it was through the department.  And, um, we just went over there.  Actually, it was a one-to-one exchange program.  Um, so they sent somebody over here, and I went over there.  So it's kind of, like--it was--it was what I wanted.  Um, don't have the buffer of all the Americans with me, get a little better feel of the culture. 
2:09 2:21 MALE: Did you--would you stay and go back, or did you have enough?
2:22 2:23 FEMALE: London, specifically, no. 
2:23 2:24 MALE: Yeah.  I feel [unintelligible]. 
2:24 2:36 FEMALE: Um, London, it's a good city to visit, but it's kind of dirty, and, um, it, it's nice.  There's a lot of stuff there, but you can't real--get a real good feel for the British culture 'cause London's--has it's own culture. 
2:36 2:37 MALE: It's very [unintelligible]. 
2:37 2:48 FEMALE: Um, but I would go back and live in Europe again.  I really liked it.  Um, tossed around the idea of Switzerland, actually.  Go doing some research in Switzerland after I'm done with my grad degree. 
2:49 2:49 MALE: Awesome. 
2:49 2:50 FEMALE: What about you?
2:50 2:53 MALE: There's a lot of, like, pharmaceutical companies [unintelligible] Switzerland, also.  Yeah. 
2:52 2:56 FEMALE: There is. Yeah, and then there's good research institutions over there. 
2:56 3:01 MALE: [unintelligible] all your PhDs and stuff, [unintelligible].  So you want to stay in academia or--
3:01 3:03 FEMALE: Uh, actually, I think I'm going to go into consulting. 
3:03 3:03 MALE: Okay. 
3:04 3:10 FEMALE: More of, kind of, like, advising pharmaceuticals on what to invest in, what to, uh, pursue [unintelligible].  Yeah. 
3:10 3:12 MALE: Cool.  So whereabouts in Minnesota are you from?
3:12 3:13 FEMALE: Minneapolis. 
3:13 3:13 MALE: Minneapolis.
3:14 3:15 FEMALE: Yeah, have you--have you been?
3:15 3:16 MALE: Yeah, yeah.  I have actually, yeah. 
3:16 3:16 FEMALE: Really?
3:16 3:22 MALE: Actually, a good friend of mine at, uh--at the business school is from Minneapolis.  His name's nameX [unintelligible]. 
3:22 3:24 FEMALE: Okay.  No.  No, I--so that's [unintelligible]. 
3:24 3:26 MALE: It's [unintelligible] city, I know, but--so.
3:25 3:25 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:26 3:36 MALE: And, uh--so you're, is it three years of classes, and then two years of [unintelligible] and then three years of a dissertation, or--
3:36 3:42 FEMALE: It's, like, a year and a half of classes, and then three and a half years of research or four and a half--
3:41 3:42 MALE: For as long as you make it, right?
3:42 3:43 FEMALE: Yeah. 
3:43 3:45 MALE: You get your Master's after your first year, or--
3:45 3:48 FEMALE: I don't actually think we get a Master's. 
3:48 3:49 MALE: Oh, you don't?  You just go straight through?
3:50 3:58 FEMALE: Right.  They don't actually invite anybody to come in for a Master's.  Um, so you don't hear too many people getting a Master's.  If you got a Master's, then there's something wrong.  
3:58 3:59 MALE: [laughter]
3:59 4:03 FEMALE: Because they don't--they don't, like, weed people out at the qualifying exam.  Everybody's expected to pass. 
4:03 4:06 MALE: I was talking to an EE guy I sail with, and he said that--
4:06 4:07 FEMALE: Yeah, EE's different. 
4:07 4:10 MALE: In EE, they expect half the department to--
4:10 4:10 FEMALE: To leave. 
4:11 4:11 MALE: To leave.  
4:11 4:18 FEMALE: That's 'cause they don't have enough funding.  So they invite a bunch of people in, and they weed them out at quals.  Then they fund the people who they--yeah. 
4:18 4:19 MALE: [unintelligible]. 
4:19 4:22 FEMALE: So here, they don't invite you to come unless they have funding for you. 
4:22 4:23 MALE: Well, I guess that's good.
4:24 4:25 FEMALE: Yeah.  So they want all of us--
4:25 4:26 MALE: To stay.  Right. 
4:26 4:30 FEMALE: To go and, you know, so it's good because [unintelligible] support system. 
4:32 4:33 MALE: How many people are in your program?
4:34 4:35 FEMALE: Let's see.  In my year, there's 16. 
4:36 4:37 MALE: That's pretty big. 
4:37 4:41 FEMALE: Yeah, but it's a little big.  It's about twice as big as it usually is. 
4:41 4:41 MALE: Uh huh. 
4:41 4:44 FEMALE: So, I don't know.  Maybe there's 60 or 70 people.  
4:46 4:50 MALE: [unintelligible] you know each other at all, or is it sort of not very tight?
4:50 4:54 FEMALE: Yeah, we do.  We know each other.  We plan a lot of social activities. 
4:54 4:55 MALE: [unintelligible] campus, or--
4:56 4:59 FEMALE: Um, no, actually.  I live over on Sand Hill, Sharon Heights area. 
4:59 5:01 MALE: Okay.  Oh, in Sharon Heights.  I live in downtown.
