0:18 0:19 MALE: One more time.
0:19 0:20 FEMALE: It's a short "u" sound, female327.
0:21 0:21 MALE: Okay.  I'm male303.
0:22 0:22 FEMALE: It's nice to meet you, male303.
0:22 0:23 MALE: How are you doing?
0:23 0:24 FEMALE: I'm good.  How about yourself?
0:25 0:26 MALE: Warming up after [unintelligible]--
0:26 0:28 FEMALE: I know.  Getting into the groove.
0:29 0:29 MALE: You?  [unintelligible].
0:30 0:30 FEMALE: [laughter] Good.
0:31 0:31 MALE: Yeah?
0:31 0:33 FEMALE: I think so.  I think so.  Yeah.
0:33 0:34 MALE: All right.  So what do you do here?
0:34 0:38 FEMALE: I'm here in the school of education, actually.  I study early childhood development.
0:39 0:40 MALE: Early childhood development.
0:40 0:40 FEMALE: Yeah.
0:40 0:42 MALE: So you want to be a researcher, or teacher or?
0:43 1:07 FEMALE: Um, probably I'll go into research, I imagine.  Um, I'm doing my doctorate here, and I think they're really looking for teacher's with  doctorates, so [laughter].  Although, I have to say, you know, I work with, you know, teachers and families and young children, and it's a lot of fun, so, you know.  It's not something that I would not enjoy doing, so.
1:08 1:09 MALE: What do you do when you're not doing your research?
1:10 1:20 FEMALE: Um, really just all sorts of things, you know.  I enjoy anything from, you know, being really chilled out and, you know, hanging out with friends, and, you know, vegging out in front of the television.  But--
1:21 1:21 MALE: What's your favorite show?
1:22 1:32 FEMALE: My favorite show?  You know, I have to say, I don't really have a favorite show.  I'm kind of hooked on life, you know, CNN, Headline News.  And you know, it's pretty much kind of running throughout the day.
1:32 1:32 MALE: Yeah.
1:33 1:35 FEMALE: Stuff like that.  But, yeah.  How about yourself?
1:36 1:36 MALE: What about me?
1:37 1:40 FEMALE: What do you study here?  Are you a student here?
1:40 1:41 MALE: I am a student here.  I am.
1:41 1:41 FEMALE: Okay.
1:42 1:45 MALE: I was a student here.  I graduated, but now I'm back in, uh, business school.
1:45 1:45 FEMALE: Okay.
1:47 1:48 MALE: There's a lot of us, I warn you.
1:48 1:48 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:49 1:49 MALE: Here tonight.
1:50 1:52 FEMALE: That's all right.  It's a good thing to do with friends, right?
1:53 1:54 MALE: Yeah.  But business school's fun.
1:54 1:54 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:55 1:57 MALE: It's, uh, I mean, classes are definitely tough.  But it's still like--
1:58 1:58 FEMALE: Yeah.
1:58 1:59 MALE: A lot more of it's kind of to--
2:00 2:00 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:00 2:01 MALE: --social aspect, but they definitely kind of--
2:02 2:02 FEMALE: Right, right.
2:02 2:03 MALE: -emphasize.
2:03 2:08 FEMALE: So how do you feel kind of, having been an undergraduate here, kind of transitioning to graduate?
2:08 2:08 MALE: I mean, actually--
2:09 2:09 FEMALE: [unintelligible].
2:09 2:10 MALE: I mean, there was--
2:10 2:10 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:10 2:11 MALE: --a four year gap in between.
2:12  2:12 FEMALE: Okay.
2:14 2:15 MALE: Uh, I was actually concerned about that.
2:15 2:15 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:16 2:20 MALE: But--so like, actually my freshman dorm is like right across the street.
2:20 2:20 FEMALE: Really [laughter]?
2:21 2:22 MALE: But like I never come up here.
2:22 2:22 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:23 2:25 MALE: Business school, we kind of stay really like just south of campus.
2:25 2:25 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.
2:26 2:29 MALE: So I mean, I've been to white plaza like five times at most.
2:29 2:29 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:30 2:31 MALE: So it's a totally different experience--
2:31 2:31 FEMALE: I'm sure.
2:32 2:32 MALE: --with different people.
2:32 2:32 FEMALE: Yeah.
2:32 2:35 MALE: So you know, but whatever concerns I had, I probably [unintelligible] about that.
2:35 2:40 FEMALE: Yeah, yeah.  Very cool.  So did you spend kind of the four years here in the Bay area?  Or were you--
2:40 2:40 MALE: I was actually in New York.
2:40 2:40 FEMALE: Okay.
2:41 2:43 MALE: Yeah.  I was living in Manhattan.
2:43 2:44 FEMALE: Okay.  Cool.
2:45 2:46 MALE: It was fun.  It was very overwhelming.
2:46 2:48 FEMALE: That's a good place to be.  Yes it is [laughter].
2:48 2:49 MALE: Have you been there a lot?
2:49 2:50 FEMALE: Um, I grew up in New York, actually.
2:50 2:50 MALE: Okay.
2:51 2:54 FEMALE: Not in Manhattan.  I grew up in Long Island.  But I lived in Manhattan for two years before I came here [unintelligible].
2:55 2:55 MALE: Yeah?  Where'd you live?
2:56 2:58 FEMALE: Um, I lived on the Upper West side.
2:59 3:00 MALE: Oh yeah.  That's where I lived my last year.
3:00 3:03 FEMALE: Okay.  That's a good place to be for a little while, I think.
3:03 3:03 MALE: Yes.
3:04 3:08 FEMALE: You know, I think you're right.  It definitely kind of wears on your nerves after a bit, but.
3:08 3:14 MALE: When you get those--when you get done with this program, are you hoping to go back to Long Island or New York?  Or not really [unintelligible]?
3:14 3:21 FEMALE: Not--I tend not to be a very planful [phonetic] person where that kind of stuff is concerned, so, you know.  I'll see where the road takes me [laughter].
3:21 3:22 MALE: Yeah?  How long's the program?
3:23 3:26 FEMALE: Yeah.  Um, I'm in my fourth year now.  So hopefully--
3:26 3:28 MALE: I don't know what that means.  That you--
3:29 3:34 FEMALE: Um, you know, it probably doesn't mean anything that--it can mean either, because, you know, it's kind of a sliding scale with these things.
3:34 3:34 MALE: Five.
3:35 3:35 FEMALE: So.
3:35 3:35 MALE: Six.
3:36 3:36 FEMALE: Yeah.  So--
3:36 3:36 MALE: Seven.
3:36 3:44 FEMALE: Yeah.  I'm doing my skilled work for my dissertation right now, so hopefully I will be done in the next year or soon.
3:45 3:45 MALE: [unintelligible]
3:45 3:50 FEMALE: I know.  Whenever people ask, I'm like, yeah, in a year or so, in a year or so. And they're like, is that not what you said two years ago [laughter]?
3:52 3:53 MALE: I'll tell you when I'm done.  How about that?
3:54 3:54 FEMALE: Exactly.
3:55 3:57 MALE: Nice. What kind of music do you listen to?
3:57 4:10 FEMALE: Um, really, I have a very, very eclectic taste in music.  Um, anything from like hip hop, to, you know, kind of classical stuff and, you know, top 40 stuff.  How about yourself?
4:11 4:13 MALE: Um, yeah.  Hip hop [unintelligible].
4:14 4:14 FEMALE: Yeah.
4:15 4:15 MALE: All right.
4:15 4:16 FEMALE: It was nice meeting you too.
