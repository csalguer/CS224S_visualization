0:02 0:02 MALE:  Hi.  
0:00 0:00 FEMALE:  Hi.  
0:04 0:05 MALE:  I'm male108 [phonetic].  
0:01 0:01 FEMALE:  I'm female133.  
0:06 0:07 MALE:  So, which school are you from?  
0:04 0:05 FEMALE:  I study economics.  
0:09 0:10 MALE:  Oh, economics.  
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
0:11 0:12 MALE:  So you are a PhD student in there?  
0:09 0:11 FEMALE:  No, I'm in the econ department.  
0:15 0:20 MALE:  Oh, so you are a PhD student there?  Oh, okay.  I'm from the [unintelligible] department.  
0:16 0:16 FEMALE:  Okay.  
0:22 0:23 MALE:  Third year PhD.  
0:19 0:19 FEMALE:  Oh, okay.  
0:25 0:27 MALE:  So you're trying out this for the first time?  
0:24 0:26 FEMALE:  No, it's the second time.  I went to Wayman's and we did it.  
0:31 0:34 MALE:  Oh, okay.  You stay at Liman [phonetic] or something?  
0:30 0:32 FEMALE:  No, I live in Raines [phonetic].  I went to Wayman's speed dating.
0:37 0:43 MALE:  Okay, so where is your home town?  Let's not talk about school because I already talked about that.  
0:39 0:41 FEMALE:  I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana.  
0:46 0:48 MALE:  Oh, so have you been to [unintelligible] there?  
0:44 0:45 FEMALE:  Been to where?  
0:49 0:49 MALE:  The Grand Prix.  
0:46 0:49 FEMALE:  Oh, the [unintelligible].  No, I've never gone to that.  
0:53 0:53 MALE:  Okay.  
0:50 0:52 FEMALE:  I was in the parade [unintelligible].  
0:56 0:58 MALE:  Okay, are you interested in that sport?  
0:54 1:06 FEMALE:  No.  [unintelligible]  So, what they do, when people buy tickets and go watch the race.  They block it off TV so you can't--you can't listen to it on the radio.  
1:10 1:11 MALE:  Oh, okay.  
1:09 1:12 FEMALE:  And they have a parade.  So, I danced there on the float of the parade.  
1:17 1:17 MALE:  Uh-huh.  
1:13 1:15 FEMALE:  I [unintelligible] like a Chinese person.  
1:20 1:20 MALE:  Why?  
1:16 1:21 FEMALE:  Because they were doing like, you know, we are the world.  I as Chinese.  
1:25 1:30 MALE:  Oh, okay.  So that was a fun thing I guess.  
1:26 1:29 FEMALE:  Well, sometimes there's horses in front of you.  
1:33 1:34 MALE:  Oh.  
1:30 1:36 FEMALE:  It kind of varies.  [crosstalk]
1:41 1:44 MALE:  So, what do you usually do in your free time or something like that?  
1:40 1:45 FEMALE:  I don't really have much free time.  You know, I hope that changes.  But I like to hike.  
1:49 1:50 MALE:  Oh, you like to hike?  
1:46 1:47 FEMALE:  Yeah.  
1:51 1:58 MALE:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's true.  When I was a [unintelligible] you don't have free time like it's the same for us.  Like the quarter system is very, very busy.  
1:54 2:00 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean last summer I had some time, and I really--and I'm just second year so I've kind of go out.  
2:05 2:07 MALE:  So you are going to do an internship or something during summer?  
2:04 2:07 FEMALE:  No.  I mean we have a paper we're supposed to write.  
2:12 2:13 MALE:  Ah, okay.  
2:10 2:13 FEMALE:  I'm going to take some [unintelligible].  I haven't been to LA before.  
2:20 2:23 MALE:  Oh.  And so what kind of research is that like?  
2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  Good question.  
2:25 2:28 MALE:  Some [unintelligible] and then [unintelligible]?  
2:25 2:32 FEMALE:  Yeah, I'm more interested in industrial organization and regulation.  So, it [unintelligible].  
2:36 2:37 MALE:  It is a little different, yeah.  
2:34 2:44 FEMALE:  Yeah, I mean you do use [unintelligible] theory in the sense of like the theories driving why people are doing something, but I don't want to invent [unintelligible].  
2:49 2:49 MALE:  Okay, okay.  
2:46 2:50 FEMALE:  I probably couldn't do that.  And a lot of people here are very good at doing that.  
2:55 2:56 MALE:  Yeah, I guess so.  
2:54 2:55 FEMALE:  What do you do?  What year are you in? 
3:00 3:04 MALE:  Yeah, I'm in third year [unintelligible].  I'm working in optimization so--
3:00 3:01 FEMALE:  [interposing] Oh, okay.  
3:05 3:12 MALE:  Like, I come across these problems about game theory and cidal points and everything.  So, they have an interpretation in economics.  
3:09 3:11 FEMALE:  Is your advisor [unintelligible]?  
3:16 3:18 MALE:  No.  My advisor is nameX [phonetic].  
3:15 3:26 FEMALE:  My roommate is [unintelligible], and her advisor--what's the name of programming or something.  Her advisors they know.  She said that a lot of double E people go there.  
3:32 3:37 MALE:  Right, yeah because there are lots of professors in [unintelligible] who are a courtesy appointment in electrical engineering.  
3:34 3:34 FEMALE:  Right.  
3:38 3:39 MALE:  So there are like lots of people.  
3:35 3:38 FEMALE:  Yeah, I didn't even understand there was any intersection between the [unintelligible].  
3:42 4:05 MALE:  Oh, there is a lot of intersection.  Yeah, like probably this course my advisor is teaching like lots of [unintelligible] guys are taking that because it totally what they want to do--it's optimization.  It's all the same.  You just apply to different problems at different AI.  So, the theory is the same.  That's very true.  
4:01 4:03 FEMALE:  Yeah, that's [unintelligible].  
4:08 4:13 MALE:  I have myself done lots of [unintelligible] and optimizing.  Well, that's the bell I guess.
