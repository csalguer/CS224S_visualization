0:03 0:04 MALE:  Hello [laughter].
0:05 0:05 FEMALE:  Hi.
0:05 0:06 MALE:  [unintelligible].
0:06 0:06 FEMALE:  female123.
0:07 0:07 MALE:  Nice to meet you.
0:08 0:08 FEMALE:  Nice to meet you, too.
0:09 0:10 MALE:  So how are you doing so far?
0:13 0:21 FEMALE:  It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Actually, my friends and I, we all walked in, and we're like--[unintelligible] okay, let's go.  We were ready to leave, 'cause we were like, oh my god.  I mean, we just--
0:22 0:23 MALE:  [laughter] What have I [unintelligible] myself into?
0:24 0:25 FEMALE:  [unintelligible].  Yeah.  Did you feel like that too?  Or?
0:26 0:53 MALE:  When I walked in, it was like, tightening up and, I was like, okay, this is kind of, okay.  But I came with a couple of people, so there's like safety in numbers.  You start walking in together, and nobody really can back out, and so you're like--and then there was--halfway through it was like, I guess we're doing this.  And like, there's are name tags.  And before--now it's just kind of drinking some water, chewing some chocolate for moral support.  And it's actually been pretty cool.
0:53 0:58 FEMALE:  They should have spiked the water, I'm telling you [laughter].  I mean, it would have just made it all go more smoothly.
0:59 1:11 MALE:  A couple of friends of ours, who knew that, uh, that we were coming, were like, "You sure you don't want a shot before you head out there? [laughter] You know you want it.  You sure you don't?"  I'm like, I think it would get--"You're sure?"  So okay.
1:11 1:13 FEMALE:  Oh my friends got a drink before they came here.
1:14 1:18 MALE:  I had one during dinner.  But that wasn't right before coming here, so that's my excuse.
1:19 1:20 FEMALE:  [laughter] Oh no.
1:20 1:23 MALE:  So.  I love your jacket.  That is cool.
1:23 1:23 FEMALE:  Thank you.  I--
1:24 1:25 MALE:  Very shiny and fuzzy.
1:25 1:37 FEMALE:  I am a big fan of this jacket.  You know, and it was in GAP.  And I never buy anything from Gap.  But I just went in there on a lark, 'cause I don't really like that store.  And I'm like, that is the most fabulous jacket ever.  I have to have it.  It was on super duper clearance too.
1:38 1:38 MALE:  [laughter] Nice.
1:39 1:43 FEMALE:  So I can't go anywhere.  And green is my new color for fall. A lot of my friends have told me I [unintelligible].
1:43 1:44 MALE:  Awesome.  It's a good color.
1:45 1:58 FEMALE:  I'm a big fan of green.  I--before I was kind of into the orange look for a long, long time.  But I've kind of decided I'm off of orange.  And I'm--I think it's too close to my skin tone, 'cause I basically am orange.  [laughter]  So I've moved on to green.
2:01 2:05 MALE:  I--they've got me into reds and yellows a couple times.  And I look sickly.
2:05 2:05 FEMALE:  Who's they?
2:06 2:07 MALE:  Various friends.
2:08 2:13 FEMALE:  They take you shopping and make you wear certain colors?  Female friends, let's be honest.
2:13 2:18 MALE:  It was female friends, and it involved a vintage store, uh, back home.
2:19 2:19 FEMALE:  Back home is?
2:19 2:20 MALE:  Uh, New Mexico.
2:21 2:21 FEMALE:  Okay.
2:21 2:25 MALE:  And like, polyester shirts with like 20 pockets and--
2:26 2:26 FEMALE:  And big collars.
2:27 2:39 MALE:  And things that I am very grateful that there was no cameras around [laughter] and that will never, ever, yes--no.  That was almost a traumatic experience.  But it was actually a lot of fun.
2:40 2:41 FEMALE:  Um, so did you buy the shirt?
2:41 2:51 MALE:  I bought one shirt.  Um, but, uh, it was actually--I really liked that one.  It was, um, like, uh, couple of tiny pockets, black down to about right here, button up.  I would take it--uh, we were getting--uh, trying to find outfits to go to a swing--Halloween swing dancing party.
3:01 3:01 FEMALE:  Do you swing dance?
3:02 3:02 MALE:  Yes.
3:02 3:02 FEMALE:  Oh.
3:03 3:05 MALE:  It's the best drug ever.
3:05 3:05 FEMALE:  Really?
3:06 3:07 MALE:  Oh yeah.  I don't--
3:07 3:08 FEMALE:  It's hard, though, to learn, isn't it?
3:09 3:16 MALE:  Well depends.  There's some that are really easy, some that are really hard.  And 'cause there's like different kinds of it--
3:16 3:16 FEMALE:  Mm-hmm.
3:17 3:19 MALE:  And jitterbug is like the easiest one to ever learn.
3:19 3:22 FEMALE:  Is that the one where the feet go like this?  No?
3:22 3:23 MALE:  I think that's more Charleston.
3:23 3:23 FEMALE:  Okay.
3:24 3:28 MALE:  Jitterbug is--they just do rock step, side, side, rock step, side, side.
3:29 3:29 FEMALE:  Oh.
3:29 3:35 MALE:  And then, you just kind of mangle that and do whatever you want to keeping that count.  And it works.
3:35 3:40 FEMALE:  Do you do that thing where you like flip people and put them around your back and like over your shoulder and like in your legs?
3:41 3:47 MALE:  I've never done that.  But um, my old dance partner and I were trying to learn it, so we were talking to this guy who was really, really good.
3:47 3:47 FEMALE:  Uh-huh.
3:48 4:12 MALE:  And he was, uh, doing flips with her.  And I was trying to get the position right.  And he was like, "It's really easy.  Just let me show you.  And so, you put your hand like this.  She's going to have her hand in," he puts my hand where she's going to have it, so feel something like this, and then the next thing I know, he's flipped me over his shoulder.  And I'm sitting there going how did this happen [laughter]?  [unintelligible] so. It was nice talking to you.
4:12 4:14 FEMALE:  It was nice talking to you, too.
